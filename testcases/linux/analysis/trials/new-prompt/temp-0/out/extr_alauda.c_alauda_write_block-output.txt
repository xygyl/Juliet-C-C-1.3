UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses the macro `MEDIA_INFO(us)` to access `pagesize` and `blocksize` without verifying whether `us->extra` is a valid pointer or properly initialized. If `us->extra` is `NULL` or points to an invalid memory location, dereferencing it will result in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `us->extra` is `NULL`, the dereference in `MEDIA_INFO(us)` will cause a null pointer dereference, leading to a crash. This is a logic bug that can occur if the caller does not ensure `us->extra` is properly initialized.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `us->extra` is not `NULL` before dereferencing it. For example:  
```c
if (!us->extra) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return an appropriate error code
}
```
