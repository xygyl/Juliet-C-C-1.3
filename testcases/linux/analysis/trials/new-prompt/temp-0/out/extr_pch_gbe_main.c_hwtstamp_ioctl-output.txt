UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses `strcpy` to copy data into the `station` array, which is declared as `u8 station[20]`. If the source string (`PTP_L4_MULTICAST_SA` or `PTP_L2_MULTICAST_SA`) exceeds 20 bytes, this will result in a buffer overflow, which is undefined behavior. The size of the source strings is not verified before copying.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The use of `strcpy` without bounds checking can lead to a buffer overflow if the source string exceeds the size of the destination buffer (`station`). This can corrupt memory and cause unpredictable behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `strcpy` with `strncpy` and ensure the destination buffer is null-terminated. For example:  
```c
strncpy(station, PTP_L4_MULTICAST_SA, sizeof(station) - 1);
station[sizeof(station) - 1] = '\0';
```  
Alternatively, validate the size of the source string before copying to ensure it fits within the destination buffer.
