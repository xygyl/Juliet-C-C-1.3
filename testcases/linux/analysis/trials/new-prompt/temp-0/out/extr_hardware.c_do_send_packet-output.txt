UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function performs pointer arithmetic on `pkt.rawpkt`, which is a member of a union. Accessing a member of a union other than the one most recently written to is undefined behavior in C unless the members are compatible types. In this case, `pkt.rawpkt` and `pkt.hdr_first` are not guaranteed to be compatible.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Undefined Behavior Access  
Bug Reason: The undefined behavior described above could lead to unpredictable behavior, including incorrect memory access or corruption.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the union member being accessed is the one most recently written to. Alternatively, avoid using unions for this purpose and use separate structures or explicit memory management to handle the data.
