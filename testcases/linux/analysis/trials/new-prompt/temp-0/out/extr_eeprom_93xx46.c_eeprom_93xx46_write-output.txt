UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function does not properly handle the case where `eeprom_93xx46_write_word` fails during the loop. If an error occurs, the function continues to disable erase/write (`eeprom_93xx46_ew(edev, 0)`) and returns the last error code, but it does not account for partial writes or rollback. This could lead to inconsistent data in the EEPROM.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Add logic to handle partial writes and rollback changes if `eeprom_93xx46_write_word` fails. Alternatively, ensure the function returns the number of bytes successfully written before the error occurred.
