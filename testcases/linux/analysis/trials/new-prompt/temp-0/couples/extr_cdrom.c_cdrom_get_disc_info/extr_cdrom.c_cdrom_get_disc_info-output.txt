UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the value of `di->disc_information_length` before using it to calculate `buflen`. If `di->disc_information_length` contains an invalid or excessively large value, this could lead to incorrect behavior or potential memory issues when setting `cgc.buflen`. Specifically, the calculation `buflen = be16_to_cpu(di->disc_information_length) + sizeof(di->disc_information_length)` assumes that `di->disc_information_length` is always valid and within a reasonable range, which may not be guaranteed.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Add a validation step to ensure that `di->disc_information_length` is within a reasonable range before using it to calculate `buflen`. For example:
```c
if (be16_to_cpu(di->disc_information_length) > MAX_DISC_INFO_LENGTH) {
    return -EINVAL; // or another appropriate error code
}
```
Where `MAX_DISC_INFO_LENGTH` is a predefined constant representing the maximum expected length of disc information.
