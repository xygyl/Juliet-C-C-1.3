UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential Out-of-Bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `priv->channel_tc2txq` is properly allocated and sized to accommodate `priv->max_nch` rows and `priv->profile->max_tc` columns. If the allocation size of `priv->channel_tc2txq` does not match these dimensions, the nested loop could result in out-of-bounds array access, leading to undefined behavior or memory corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `priv->channel_tc2txq` is allocated with dimensions `[priv->max_nch][priv->profile->max_tc]` before calling this function. Add a check to verify the allocation size or bounds before accessing the array.
