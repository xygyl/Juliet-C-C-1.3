UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses the `SHASH_DESC_ON_STACK` macro to allocate a `shash_desc` structure on the stack. However, the size of the `shash_desc` structure depends on the `struct crypto_shash` object, which may lead to stack overflow if the size exceeds the available stack space. This is undefined behavior as per the C standard because it can result in memory corruption or unpredictable behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory corruption  
Bug Reason: The potential stack overflow caused by the dynamic size of the `shash_desc` structure can lead to memory corruption, which is a critical bug.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Use dynamic memory allocation (e.g., `kmalloc` or `malloc`) for the `shash_desc` structure instead of allocating it on the stack. Ensure proper error handling for allocation failures.
