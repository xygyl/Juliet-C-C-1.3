UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the `p->frequency` value before using it to calculate `tuner_frequency`. If `p->frequency` is negative, the calculation `tuner_frequency = p->frequency + 36125000` could result in an invalid frequency value, leading to incorrect behavior or unintended results. This is a logic error because the function assumes `p->frequency` is always valid and non-negative.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `p->frequency` is non-negative before performing calculations. For example:
```c
if (p->frequency < 0)
    return -EINVAL;
```
