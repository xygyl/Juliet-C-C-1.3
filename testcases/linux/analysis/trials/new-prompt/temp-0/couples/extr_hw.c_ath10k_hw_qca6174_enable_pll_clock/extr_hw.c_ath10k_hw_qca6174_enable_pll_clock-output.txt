UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function contains a logic error in the busy-wait loop for checking the `RTC_SYNC_STATUS_PLL_CHANGING` status. If the `wait_limit` reaches zero, the function does not handle the timeout condition properly and continues execution, potentially leading to incorrect behavior. This could result in the function returning success (`0`) even though the PLL synchronization did not complete successfully.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Add a proper timeout handling mechanism. For example, if `wait_limit` reaches zero, return an error code indicating a timeout (e.g., `-ETIMEDOUT`) instead of continuing execution.
