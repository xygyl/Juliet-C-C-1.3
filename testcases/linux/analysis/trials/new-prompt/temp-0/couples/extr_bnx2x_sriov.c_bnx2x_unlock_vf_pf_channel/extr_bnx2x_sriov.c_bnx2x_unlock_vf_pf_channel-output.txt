UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function contains a potential logic error in the `WARN` macro invocation. If `expected_tlv` does not match `vf->op_current`, the mismatch is logged, but the function proceeds to unlock the mutex and reset `vf->op_current` to `CHANNEL_TLV_NONE`. This could lead to inconsistent state or unintended behavior if the mismatch indicates a serious issue. The function does not handle the mismatch beyond logging it, which may not be sufficient in certain scenarios.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Add proper error handling or recovery logic when `expected_tlv` does not match `vf->op_current`. For example, consider returning early or taking corrective action to ensure the state remains consistent.
