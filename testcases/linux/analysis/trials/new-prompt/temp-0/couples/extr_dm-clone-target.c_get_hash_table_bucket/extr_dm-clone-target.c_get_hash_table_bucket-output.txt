UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not check whether `clone` or `clone->ht` is `NULL` before dereferencing them. If `clone` or `clone->ht` is `NULL`, this will lead to undefined behavior and a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `clone` and `clone->ht` are not `NULL` before dereferencing them. For example:
```c
if (!clone || !clone->ht) {
    return NULL; // Or handle the error appropriately
}
```
