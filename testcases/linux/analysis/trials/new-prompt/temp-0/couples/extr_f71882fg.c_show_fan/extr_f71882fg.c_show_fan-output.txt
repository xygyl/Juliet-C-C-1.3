Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-1/part_3/extr_f71882fg.c_show_fan.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds access in `data->fan[nr]`. The value of `nr` is derived from `to_sensor_dev_attr_2(devattr)->index`, but there is no validation to ensure `nr` is within the bounds of the `data->fan` array. If `nr` is out of bounds, accessing `data->fan[nr]` results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: Same as UB Reason. An out-of-bounds access can lead to incorrect behavior or crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Validate `nr` to ensure it is within the bounds of the `data->fan` array before accessing `data->fan[nr]`. For example:
```c
if (nr < 0 || nr >= ARRAY_SIZE(data->fan)) {
    return -EINVAL; // or another appropriate error handling
}
```
