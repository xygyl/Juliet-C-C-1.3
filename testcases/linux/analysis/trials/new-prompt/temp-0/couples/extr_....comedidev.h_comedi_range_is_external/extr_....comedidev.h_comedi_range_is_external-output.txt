UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds access in `s->range_table->range[range]`. The `range` parameter is used as an index without any bounds checking, which could lead to undefined behavior if `range` exceeds the valid bounds of the `range` array.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the `range` parameter, which could lead to accessing invalid memory if `range` is out of bounds. This could cause a crash or unpredictable behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence (1-10): 9  

Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking for the `range` parameter to ensure it is within the valid range of indices for the `range` array. For example:  
```c
if (range >= MAX_RANGE) {  
    return false;  
}
```  
Where `MAX_RANGE` is the size of the `range` array. Ensure `MAX_RANGE` is defined appropriately based on the structure of `range_table`.
