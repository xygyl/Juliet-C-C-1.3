UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function does not handle the case where `state->dst_type` is invalid (i.e., not one of the defined types). While the function logs an error message and frees the `state` object, it does not ensure that the caller is aware of the failure. Returning `NULL` in this case is correct, but the caller must be responsible for checking the return value to avoid further issues. If the caller does not check the return value, it could lead to dereferencing a `NULL` pointer, causing a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the caller of `dst_attach` properly checks the return value for `NULL` before using the returned `state` object. Alternatively, add documentation or comments to emphasize this requirement.
