UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential signed integer overflow in expressions like `(addr + 7) >> 3` and `((stride + 7) >> 3) << CANVAS_WIDTH_LBIT`. If `addr` or `stride` are large enough, adding 7 could cause signed integer overflow, which is undefined behavior in C.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the range of `canvas_index` before accessing `canvas->used[canvas_index]`. If `canvas_index` is out of bounds, this could lead to an out-of-bounds array access, which is a bug.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add range validation for `canvas_index` to ensure it is within the bounds of the `canvas->used` array.  
   ```c
   if (canvas_index >= ARRAY_SIZE(canvas->used)) {
       dev_err(canvas->dev, "Canvas index out of bounds: %u\n", canvas_index);
       spin_unlock_irqrestore(&canvas->lock, flags);
       return -EINVAL;
   }
   ```
2. Use unsigned integers for `addr` and `stride` to avoid signed integer overflow, or explicitly check for overflow conditions before performing arithmetic operations.
