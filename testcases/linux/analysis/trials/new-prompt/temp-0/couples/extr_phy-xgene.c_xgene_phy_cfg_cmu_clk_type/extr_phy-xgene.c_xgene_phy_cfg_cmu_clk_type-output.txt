UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: In the `CLK_INT_SING` case, the function writes to `CMU_REG1` twice consecutively without ensuring the intermediate state is meaningful. Specifically, the second write overwrites the result of the first write, making the first write redundant. This could lead to unintended behavior or configuration issues.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Remove the redundant write to `CMU_REG1` in the `CLK_INT_SING` case, or ensure the intermediate state is necessary for the intended configuration.
