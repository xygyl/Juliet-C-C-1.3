Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-1/part_1/extr_base.c_nvkm_mmu_type.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses `ARRAY_SIZE(mmu->type)` to check the bounds of `mmu->type_nr`. However, `ARRAY_SIZE` is a macro that calculates the size of the array at compile time, and it assumes that `mmu->type` is a statically allocated array. If `mmu->type` is dynamically allocated, this check will not work correctly, leading to potential out-of-bounds access.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The logic assumes that `mmu->type` is a statically allocated array, but if it is dynamically allocated, the `ARRAY_SIZE` macro will not provide the correct size, potentially causing incorrect behavior or memory corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `ARRAY_SIZE(mmu->type)` with a runtime check that uses the actual size of the dynamically allocated array (e.g., by storing the size in a separate variable or using a dynamic allocation tracking mechanism).
