UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the `cpu` parameter, which could lead to incorrect behavior if `cpu` is out of bounds or invalid. While the `phys_ctr` parameter is checked against `NR_PHYS_CTRS`, there is no similar validation for `cpu`. This could result in undefined behavior or incorrect memory access depending on how `READ_SHADOW_REG` and `READ_MMIO_UPPER32` handle the `cpu` parameter.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Add validation for the `cpu` parameter to ensure it is within the expected range before proceeding with the function logic.
