UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The subtraction `(void *)v - (void *)location` results in pointer arithmetic between two pointers that may not belong to the same object or array. According to the C standard, subtracting pointers that do not belong to the same object or array is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The calculation of `offset` assumes that `v` and `location` are part of the same memory object or array, which may not be true. This could lead to incorrect results or crashes depending on the runtime memory layout.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `v` and `location` are guaranteed to belong to the same memory object or array before performing pointer subtraction. Alternatively, use a different approach to calculate the offset that does not rely on pointer arithmetic.
