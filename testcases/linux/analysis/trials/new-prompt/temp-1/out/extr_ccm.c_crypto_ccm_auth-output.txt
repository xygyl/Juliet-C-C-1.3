UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: In the section where `ilen` is calculated as the padding length (`ilen = 16 - (assoclen + ilen) % 16`), the existing variable `ilen` is reused for a different purpose after it was first calculated and used for the associated data's length (`ilen = format_adata(idata, assoclen)`). This reuse causes overlap and logical confusion between padding and input length calculation. The value stored in `ilen` for padding calculation overwrites the original meaning of `ilen`. This could potentially lead to unintended behavior or misuse of the variable if further operations mistakenly depend on `ilen` as the original input length.

Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 7
Fix Suggestion: Use separate variables for the associated data input length and the padding length. Introduce a new variable, e.g., `padlen`, to store the computed padding length (`padlen = 16 - (assoclen + ilen) % 16`) and leave `ilen` untouched for its previous role.
