UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Management  
Bug Reason: The function `sym_re_search` allocates memory for `sym_arr`, but the subsequent call to `free(sym_arr)` causes a potential double-free issue or invalid memory access if `sym_arr` was not allocated dynamically or has already been freed. The responsibility of memory management should be clearly documented or handled to ensure no double-free or invalid free occurs. Additionally, the memory allocated for `dialog_input_result` or `dialog_input` may not be properly freed before function exit, leading to potential memory leaks.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 7  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `sym_re_search` explicitly documents whether it allocates memory dynamically for `sym_arr`, and track its ownership. If dynamically allocated, always verify the validity and allocation state of `sym_arr` before freeing. Additionally, ensure that `dialog_input_result` or `dialog_input` is properly freed after usage.
