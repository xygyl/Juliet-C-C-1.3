UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code calls `parse_int_file()` with hardcoded arguments (`1, "/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu%d/online", i`). It is possible that the `%d` in the string format is intended for `i`, but no formatting occurs due to the direct string being passed, leading to incorrect behavior. This could also indirectly cause undefined behavior if it leaves `online` uninitialized and passes it into conditional checks.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The input `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu%d/online` in `parse_int_file()` likely results in incorrect string handling due to the lack of proper formatting with the `i` variable, intended to substitute `%d`. The missing format substitution could lead to runtime error or a failure in checking the correct `online` status for specific CPU identifiers. This introduces unintended behavior affecting program correctness.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Modify the `parse_int_file()` invocation to perform proper string formatting, such as using `snprintf()` to form the path:  
```c
char path[128];
snprintf(path, sizeof(path), "/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu%d/online", i);
online = parse_int_file(1, path, i);
```
