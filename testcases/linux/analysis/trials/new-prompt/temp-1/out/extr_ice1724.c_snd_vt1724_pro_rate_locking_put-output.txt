UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: `PRO_RATE_LOCKED` appears to be treated as a variable, but it is not declared in the provided code. Assigning a value to an undefined identifier leads to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic error
Bug Reason: The code attempts to compare and modify the `PRO_RATE_LOCKED` value, but this identifier lacks declaration or definition in the snippet provided. This likely results in a runtime error since the actual behavior of the code depends on the definition of `PRO_RATE_LOCKED`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Declare or define `PRO_RATE_LOCKED` as a global or local variable with the correct type (likely `int`) prior to its use in the function.
