UB Detected: No  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The code incorrectly computes the bit-shifting for `size == 2`. In this case, `(where & 3)` is used, but it assumes that a 2-byte operation will naturally align on a 2-byte boundary, which might not always hold true. Specifically, it does not align correctly when the higher address bits of `where` are non-zero. This could corrupt unrelated bits inside the targeted data during writing.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Modify the bit manipulation logic for `size == 2` as follows:  
```c
data = (data & ~(0xffff << ((where & ~1) << 3))) | (val << ((where & ~1) << 3));
```
This ensures proper alignment of the 16-bit write operation.
