UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential for buffer overflow due to unchecked usage of `sprintf`. If the array `buf` does not have enough space to accommodate all values in `arates_hz` plus formatting, this would result in undefined behavior (writing beyond the bounds of `buf`).  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: `sprintf` writes to `buf` without any bounds checking, which could lead to buffer overflow if `buf` is too small to store the formatted string.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `sprintf` with `snprintf`, specifying the size of the `buf` array to avoid writing past its bounds. Alternatively, ensure `buf` is allocated large enough to accommodate the maximum possible output for `arates_hz` values.
