UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The function does not handle unknown `siw_access_state` values gracefully. In the `default` case, `WARN_ON(1)` is called, signaling a problem but does not take any action to recover or handle invalid input, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior. Ideally, function behavior should be well-defined even in the presence of unexpected input values.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Add a proper error or handling mechanism in the `default` case, such as returning a distinct error code or logging the invalid input explicitly.
