UB Detected: No  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Possible Out-of-Bounds Access  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the size of `MACReg` and `MACBackup` arrays. If either array is less than `IQK_MAC_REG_NUM` in size, accessing beyond the bounds of these arrays during the loop would cause undefined behavior and potentially a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Validate that both `MACReg` and `MACBackup` have sufficient elements (at least `IQK_MAC_REG_NUM`) before access. Use explicit memory checks or assert statements prior to the loop.
