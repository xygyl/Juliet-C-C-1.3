UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Bug
Bug Reason: The function has an issue in the logic for handling PAE40-enabled configurations when performing I-cache invalidation. Specifically, `ARC_REG_IC_PTAG_HI` is set using the higher 32 bits of `paddr` before the actual operation loop. However, for each cache line (when `full_page` is `false`), the `paddr` is effectively updated, which may cause the cached PTAG_HI value to be inconsistent with subsequent PTAG values. This mismatch could lead to incorrect cache invalidation for systems with PAE40 enabled and aliasing I-cache configurations.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Write the upper 8 bits of `paddr` (via `ARC_REG_IC_PTAG_HI`) inside the loop just before updating `ARC_REG_IC_PTAG`. This ensures that both the lower and higher parts of the `paddr` are updated consistently as `paddr` changes.
