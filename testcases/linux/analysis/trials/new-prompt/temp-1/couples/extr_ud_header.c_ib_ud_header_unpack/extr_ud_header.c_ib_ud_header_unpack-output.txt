UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Alignment Issue
Bug Reason: Directly casting `buf` to pointer types without verification may result in misaligned pointer dereference. On certain architectures, misaligned accesses can trigger runtime errors or performance issues. Specifically, incremental pointer arithmetic with `buf += sizeof(TYPE)` assumes proper alignment without ensuring it.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Ensure proper alignment of `buf` before incrementing. For example, use `assert((uintptr_t)buf % alignof(TYPE) == 0)` or use aligned memory allocations.
