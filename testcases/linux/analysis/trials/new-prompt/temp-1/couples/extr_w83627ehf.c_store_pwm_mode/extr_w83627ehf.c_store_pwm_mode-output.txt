Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-2/part_8/extr_w83627ehf.c_store_pwm_mode.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds access on the `W83627EHF_PWM_MODE_SHIFT` and `W83627EHF_REG_PWM_ENABLE` arrays if `nr` exceeds the bounds of these arrays. There is no explicit bounds check for `nr`, which could be an index violation if the `index` passed from `sensor_attr` via `to_sensor_dev_attr` exceeds the sizes of the related arrays.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Access
Bug Reason: The lack of bounds checking for the `nr` variable leads to the risk of undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access. This may cause incorrect behavior or crashes when accessing `W83627EHF_PWM_MODE_SHIFT` or `W83627EHF_REG_PWM_ENABLE`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking for the `nr` index to ensure it does not exceed the size of `W83627EHF_PWM_MODE_SHIFT` or `W83627EHF_REG_PWM_ENABLE` arrays before performing any array access. For example:
```c
#define MAX_PWM_INDEX <appropriate_value>

if (nr < 0 || nr >= MAX_PWM_INDEX)
    return -EINVAL;
```
