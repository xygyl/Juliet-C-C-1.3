UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The `strcmp` function fails to differentiate between characters that are less than or greater than each other, always returning 1 for inequality. A correct implementation of `strcmp` should return a negative value if the first string is lexicographically less than the second, and a positive value if it's greater. Furthermore, it improperly handles cases where one string ends before the other. Lastly, the redundant check `if (*a == 0 || *b == 0)` is unnecessary as the condition `while (*a || *b)` already accounts for string termination.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Implement a standard `strcmp` logic:
```c
int strcmp(const char *a, const char *b) {
    while (*a && *b && (*a == *b)) {
        a++;
        b++;
    }
    return *(unsigned char *)a - *(unsigned char *)b;
}
```
