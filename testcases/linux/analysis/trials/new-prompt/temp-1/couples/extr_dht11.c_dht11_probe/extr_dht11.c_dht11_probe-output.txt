UB Detected: No
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The logic assumes that if `gpiod_to_irq()` returns a negative value, it is always caused by a lack of interrupt support for the GPIO. However, the negative value could actually represent another error related to `gpiod_to_irq()`. This may lead to misleading error messages being logged (`"GPIO %d has no interrupt"`), which could hinder debugging.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Verify the exact error code from `gpiod_to_irq()` before logging, and provide a more accurate error message depending on the specific negative value returned.
