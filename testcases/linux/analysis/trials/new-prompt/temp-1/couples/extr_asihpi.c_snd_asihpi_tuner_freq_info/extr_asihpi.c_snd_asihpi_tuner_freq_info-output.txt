UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The loop skips a band with bogus stepping (when `temp_freq_range[2] <= 0`) but proceeds to update `freq_range` with potentially invalid frequency ranges (`temp_freq_range`) even for bands whose `temp_freq_range[2]` is bogus. This logic flaw could result in incorrect frequency range data being returned in `freq_range`.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Move the logic to update `freq_range` to occur only for bands that pass the `temp_freq_range[2] <= 0` check (e.g., wrap updates to `freq_range` with the same `continue` logic).
