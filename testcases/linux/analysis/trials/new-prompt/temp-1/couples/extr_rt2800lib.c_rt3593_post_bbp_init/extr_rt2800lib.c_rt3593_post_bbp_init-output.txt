UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: Near the end of the function, the BBP register 105 is written again (`rt2800_bbp_write(rt2x00dev, 105, 0x04)`), potentially overwriting the configuration that was set earlier based on the value of `rx_chain_num`. This could lead to an unintended device behavior or incorrect register settings, creating a logical bug if subsequent register writes depend on the earlier configuration.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Verify if overwriting BBP register 105 at the end is intentional. If the later write is unnecessary or should depend on prior conditions, remove or conditionally execute this line.
