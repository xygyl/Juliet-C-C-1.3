UB Detected: No
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The `tiocmget` function is invoked multiple times without storing its result in any intervening variable or using the result meaningfully. It's possible that the repeated calls were unnecessary or the result of a copy-paste mistake.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 7
Fix Suggestion: Store the result of each `tiocmget` invocation in a variable if meaningful, or remove the redundant calls to improve code clarity and potentially avoid unintended behavior.
