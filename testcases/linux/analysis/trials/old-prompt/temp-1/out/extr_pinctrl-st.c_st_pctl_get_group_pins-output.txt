UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing out-of-bounds memory on `info->groups[selector]` is possible if `selector` is not checked properly. While the check `selector >= info->ngroups` rejects selectors larger than or equal to `ngroups`, the function assumes `info->groups[selector]` is always valid memory, which might not be true (e.g., if `info->groups` is NULL or if `ngroups` does not match the actual allocated array bounds).  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes `info->groups` is always initialized and non-NULL, but there is no validation for `info->groups` before accessing it. If `info->groups` is NULL, dereferencing `info->groups[selector]` will result in undefined behavior or a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add a NULL check for `info->groups` before accessing it:  
   ```c
   if (info->groups == NULL)
       return -EINVAL;
   ```

2. Ensure that `info->groups` is properly initialized and matches the value of `ngroups` during the setup phase (not shown in this code snippet).
