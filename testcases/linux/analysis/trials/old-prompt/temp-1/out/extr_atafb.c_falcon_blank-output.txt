UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Attempting to access or manipulate variables or structs that are likely improperly initialized or uninitialized. Specifically, the `videl` structure fields are used for assignment (`videl.vdb`, `videl.vss`, `videl.hbe`, `videl.hss`) without evidence that `videl` is initialized. Reading uninitialized variables can cause undefined behavior as per the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug / Undefined Behavior Issue  
Bug Reason: The function sets the fields of the `videl` structure but does not validate whether `current_par` (used for calculating values) or `videl` are properly initialized. If either structure contains garbage values due to improper initialization, the calculation and assignment to `videl` fields will propagate incorrect or undefined values into the program's flow.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `current_par` and `videl` are fully initialized before the function is executed. Add explicit checks or initialization code for all fields of `videl` and `current_par`, and ensure that the `mon_type` variable is valid before comparison operations.
