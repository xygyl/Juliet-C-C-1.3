UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `tegra_powergate_add()` or subsequent operations fail and `IS_ERR(powergate)` returns true, the `i` counter is still incremented before reaching the `remove` label. Subsequently, the `while (i--)` loop can access uninitialized entries in the `domains` array, since `domains[i]` may not have been set for all indices before encountering the error. Accessing uninitialized memory results in undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory corruption or invalid access
Bug Reason: Accessing uninitialized elements in the `domains` array during the `remove` loop causes invalid memory access and potential crashes. This arises because `domains[i]` is not guaranteed to be valid for all iterations if an error occurs before all `powergate` entries are created successfully.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the `domains[]` array is only accessed for valid indices during the cleanup loop. Add a condition to validate whether `domains[i]` was successfully allocated or set:
```c
remove:
	while (i--) {
		if (domains[i]) {  // Ensure the entry is valid
			powergate = to_tegra_powergate(domains[i]);
			tegra_powergate_remove(powergate);
		}
	}
	kfree(genpd->domains);
	return err;
```
This prevents accessing uninitialized or invalid elements in the cleanup phase.
