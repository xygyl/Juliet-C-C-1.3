UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses `memset()` to zero out a buffer (`idata`) during the padding step. If `idata` is improperly aligned or points to an invalid memory region, this operation could invoke undefined behavior. Additionally, it assumes the source buffer (`req->src`), and other scatter-gather lists (`plain` or `sg`) are properly initialized and valid, but these assumptions might lead to undefined behavior if violated.
  
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw, Memory corruption
Bug Reason: Scatter-gather operations (`sg_chain`, `sg_set_buf`, and `sg_init_table`) and `crypto_ahash_set_crypt()` assume the buffers and structures passed to them are valid. If `req->src` or `plain` doesn't contain enough valid memory or aligned data, these fields could trigger invalid memory access or corruption. The padding logic also overwrites memory without verifying the bounds of `idata`, risking memory corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion:
1. Ensure that all buffers (`odata`, `idata`, `plain`, `req->src`) are properly checked for validity and alignment before any operations.
2. Explicitly validate the input parameters before calling `format_input()` and `format_adata()` functions.
3. Add checks to ensure that all scatter-gather lists have sufficient capacity and memory before chaining them.
4. Use defensive programming practices, e.g., sanitize all memory accesses and add appropriate bounds checks.
