UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function potentially dereferences a null pointer when `clone->ht` is accessed without null-checking. If `clone` or `clone->ht` is not initialized correctly, this code results in undefined behavior due to a null pointer dereference.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not check if `clone` or `clone->ht` is valid before dereferencing them in the expression `clone->ht[hash_long(region_nr, HASH_TABLE_BITS)]`. If the `clone` object or its `ht` member is not properly initialized, it will lead to runtime issues.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add null checks for `clone` and `clone->ht` before dereferencing them. Example:
```c
if (!clone || !clone->ht)
    return NULL;
```
