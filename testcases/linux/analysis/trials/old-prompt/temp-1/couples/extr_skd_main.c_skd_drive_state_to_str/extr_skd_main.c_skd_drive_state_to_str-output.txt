UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function is type-safe and does not perform operations that can result in undefined behavior according to the C standard. The switch-case logic is well-formed, and the default case ensures all possible integer inputs are handled.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: There appears to be a typo in the literal string returned for the case `FIT_SR_PCIE_LINK_DOWN`. The returned string `"INK_DOWN"` is almost certainly intended to be `"LINK_DOWN"` instead. This could lead to unintended behavior or a mismatch in expected outputs.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Update the return string for `FIT_SR_PCIE_LINK_DOWN` to "LINK_DOWN".  

Revised Case:
```c
	case FIT_SR_PCIE_LINK_DOWN:
		return "LINK_DOWN";
```
