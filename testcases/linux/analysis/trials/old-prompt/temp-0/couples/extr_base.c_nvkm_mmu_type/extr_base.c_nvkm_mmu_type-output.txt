Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-0/part_1/extr_base.c_nvkm_mmu_type.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses `ARRAY_SIZE(mmu->type)` to check the bounds of `mmu->type_nr`. However, `ARRAY_SIZE` is defined as `sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0])`, which assumes that `mmu->type` is a statically allocated array. If `mmu->type` is dynamically allocated, `ARRAY_SIZE` will produce incorrect results, leading to potential out-of-bounds access. This is undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The function increments `mmu->type_nr` without verifying that `mmu->type` has enough capacity to store the new entry. If `mmu->type_nr` exceeds the actual size of `mmu->type`, this will result in out-of-bounds memory access, which is a critical bug. Additionally, the use of `WARN_ON` does not prevent execution from continuing, so the function may still proceed with invalid memory writes.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Replace `ARRAY_SIZE(mmu->type)` with a proper mechanism to track the allocated size of `mmu->type`. For example, introduce a field in the `nvkm_mmu` structure to store the allocated size of `mmu->type` and compare `mmu->type_nr` against this field. Additionally, ensure that the function does not proceed after a `WARN_ON` condition is triggered.

Example fix:
```c
static void
nvkm_mmu_type(struct nvkm_mmu *mmu, int heap, u8 type)
{
    if (heap >= 0 && mmu->type_nr < mmu->type_alloc_size) { // Use a proper size check
        mmu->type[mmu->type_nr].type = type | mmu->heap[heap].type;
        mmu->type[mmu->type_nr].heap = heap;
        mmu->type_nr++;
    } else {
        WARN_ON(1); // Log the warning
        return;     // Prevent further execution
    }
}
```
