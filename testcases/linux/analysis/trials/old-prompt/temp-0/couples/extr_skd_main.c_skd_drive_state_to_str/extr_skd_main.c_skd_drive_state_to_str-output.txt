UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain any undefined behavior. It uses a `switch` statement to map integer values to string literals, and all cases return valid string literals. The default case handles unexpected values gracefully by returning `"???"`. There are no operations that violate the C standard, such as null pointer dereferencing, uninitialized variable access, or signed integer overflow.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The string returned for the `FIT_SR_PCIE_LINK_DOWN` case is `"INK_DOWN"`, which appears to be a typo and likely intended to be `"LINK_DOWN"`. This could lead to incorrect behavior or confusion when interpreting the state.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Correct the typo in the `FIT_SR_PCIE_LINK_DOWN` case to return `"LINK_DOWN"` instead of `"INK_DOWN"`.
