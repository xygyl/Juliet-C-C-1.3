Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-0/part_1/extr_atafb.c_falcon_blank.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function accesses and modifies global variables (`current_par` and `videl`) without any synchronization mechanism. If this function is called concurrently from multiple threads, it may lead to a data race, which is undefined behavior in C. Additionally, the function does not validate the `blank_mode` input, which could lead to out-of-bounds access or unintended behavior if `blank_mode` is negative or excessively large.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Concurrency Issue
Bug Reason: The lack of synchronization when accessing and modifying global variables (`current_par` and `videl`) can lead to race conditions in a multithreaded environment. This can cause inconsistent or corrupted data.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Introduce proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes) to protect access to the global variables `current_par` and `videl`. Additionally, validate the `blank_mode` input to ensure it falls within the expected range.
