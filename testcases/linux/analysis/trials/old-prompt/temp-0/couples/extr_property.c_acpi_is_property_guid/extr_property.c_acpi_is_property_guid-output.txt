UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not validate whether `guid` is `NULL` before dereferencing it in the call to `guid_equal`. If `guid` is `NULL`, dereferencing it results in undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `guid` is `NULL`, the function will attempt to dereference it in the call to `guid_equal`, leading to a null pointer dereference bug. This can cause a crash or other unintended behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `guid` is not `NULL`. For example:
```c
if (guid == NULL)
    return false;
```
