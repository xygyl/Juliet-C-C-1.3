UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences the pointer `pkey` without checking if it is `NULL`. If `pkey` is passed as `NULL`, this results in undefined behavior due to a null pointer dereference.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function assumes that the `pkey` pointer is valid and does not perform a null check before dereferencing it. If `pkey` is `NULL`, the program will crash or exhibit undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for the `pkey` pointer at the beginning of the function. For example:
```c
if (!pkey)
    return -EINVAL; // Return an appropriate error code
```
