Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-0/part_1/extr_atbm8830.c_is_locked.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences the pointer `locked` without verifying that it is non-NULL. While there is a check (`if (locked != NULL)`), the pointer is dereferenced before the check in the statement `*locked = (status == 1);`. If `locked` is NULL, this results in undefined behavior due to a null pointer dereference.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not ensure that the `locked` pointer is non-NULL before dereferencing it. This can lead to a crash or undefined behavior if the caller passes a NULL pointer for `locked`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Move the dereference of `locked` inside the conditional block that checks for `locked != NULL`. For example:
```c
if (locked != NULL)
    *locked = (status == 1);
```
This ensures that `locked` is only dereferenced if it is non-NULL.
