UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function contains potential undefined behavior due to the use of uninitialized variables. Specifically, the variable `rx_pwr_all` is used in calculations before being initialized in the case where `is_cck_rate` is false. If the `is_cck_rate` condition is false, the initialization of `rx_pwr_all` is skipped, leading to undefined behavior when it is later used in calculations.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The logic assumes that `rx_pwr_all` will always be initialized, but this is not guaranteed when `is_cck_rate` is false. This can lead to incorrect signal strength calculations and potentially incorrect behavior of the function.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `rx_pwr_all` is initialized to a default value (e.g., `0`) at the beginning of the function to prevent undefined behavior when it is used later in calculations.
