UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Management Issue
Bug Reason: The function allocates memory for `bss_cfg` using `kzalloc` but does not check whether `mwifiex_send_cmd` modifies the pointer or requires the memory to persist beyond the function scope. If `mwifiex_send_cmd` uses the pointer asynchronously or stores it for later use, freeing `bss_cfg` immediately after the call could lead to a use-after-free bug.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `mwifiex_send_cmd` does not use the `bss_cfg` pointer asynchronously or store it for later use. If it does, avoid freeing `bss_cfg` immediately and manage its lifetime appropriately.
