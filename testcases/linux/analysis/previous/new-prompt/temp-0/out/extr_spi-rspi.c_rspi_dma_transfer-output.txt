UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The variable `other_irq` is initialized to `0` but may be used unconditionally in the call to `disable_irq(other_irq)` if `tx` is non-NULL. If `rspi->tx_irq` is not set properly, this could lead to disabling an unintended IRQ or no IRQ at all. This could cause unexpected behavior in the system.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `rspi->tx_irq` is properly initialized before calling `disable_irq(other_irq)` or add a check to verify its validity before use.
