UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate the pointer `ws` before dereferencing it. If `ws` is `NULL` or invalid, dereferencing it will result in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If the caller passes a `NULL` pointer for `ws`, the function will dereference it, leading to a crash or undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `ws` is not `NULL`. For example:  
```c
if (ws == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
