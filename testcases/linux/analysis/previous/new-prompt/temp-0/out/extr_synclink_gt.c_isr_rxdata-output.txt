UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds access in `info->rbufs[i].buf[count++]` if `count` exceeds the buffer size or `i` exceeds the number of allocated buffers (`info->rbuf_count`). The code does not validate `count` against the actual buffer size or ensure `i` is within bounds before accessing `info->rbufs[i].buf`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The function does not validate `count` against the size of the buffer or ensure `i` is within bounds before accessing `info->rbufs[i].buf`. This can lead to a buffer overflow or invalid memory access.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit checks to ensure `count` does not exceed the size of the buffer and `i` does not exceed `info->rbuf_count`. For example:
```c
if (count >= BUFFER_SIZE || i >= info->rbuf_count) {
    rx_stop(info);
    info->rx_restart = 1;
    continue;
}
```
Replace `BUFFER_SIZE` with the actual size of the buffer.
