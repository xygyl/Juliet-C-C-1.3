UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function uses `WARN` to log warnings but does not handle the error conditions properly. If `of_find_compatible_node` fails and `np` is `NULL`, the function simply returns without ensuring that the watchdog restart setup is completed. Similarly, if `of_iomap` fails and `wdt_regs` is `NULL`, the function does not take corrective action. This could lead to undefined behavior or system instability later if `wdt_regs` is used without proper initialization.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Add proper error handling to ensure that the function either completes the setup successfully or takes corrective action (e.g., logging the error and aborting further operations). For example:
```c
if (!np) {
    pr_err("Failed to find compatible node for watchdog restart\n");
    return;
}

wdt_regs = of_iomap(np, 0);
if (!wdt_regs) {
    pr_err("Failed to remap watchdog registers\n");
    return;
}
```
