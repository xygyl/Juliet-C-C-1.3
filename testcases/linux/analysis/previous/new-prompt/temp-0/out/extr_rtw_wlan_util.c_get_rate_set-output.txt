UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The function `memcpy(pbssrate, supportedrates, *bssrate_len)` copies `*bssrate_len` bytes from `supportedrates` to `pbssrate`. However, there is no guarantee that `pbssrate` has enough allocated space to hold `*bssrate_len` bytes. If `pbssrate` points to a smaller buffer, this could lead to a buffer overflow.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `pbssrate` has sufficient allocated space to hold `*bssrate_len` bytes before calling `memcpy`. For example, add a check or document the required size of `pbssrate` in the function's contract.
