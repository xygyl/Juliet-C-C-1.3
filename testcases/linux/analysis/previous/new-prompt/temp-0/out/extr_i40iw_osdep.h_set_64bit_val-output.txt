UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function performs an array access using `wqe_words[byte_index >> 3]`. If `byte_index >> 3` results in an out-of-bounds index for the `wqe_words` array, this would lead to undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds memory access. The code does not validate the bounds of `byte_index` or ensure that `wqe_words` has sufficient size.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The function does not check whether `byte_index >> 3` is within the bounds of the `wqe_words` array, which could lead to memory corruption or crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check to ensure that `byte_index >> 3` is within the valid range of indices for the `wqe_words` array. For example:  
```c
if ((byte_index >> 3) >= array_size) {
    // Handle error or return
}
```
