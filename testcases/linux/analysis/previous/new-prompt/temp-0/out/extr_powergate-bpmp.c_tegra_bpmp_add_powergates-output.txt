UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Leak
Bug Reason: If the function encounters an error during the loop (e.g., `IS_ERR(powergate)` evaluates to true), it jumps to the `remove` label. However, the allocated memory for `domains` via `kcalloc` is freed using `kfree(genpd->domains)` instead of directly freeing `domains`. If `genpd->domains` is not set before the error occurs, this could lead to a memory leak because the allocated `domains` array is not properly freed.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Replace `kfree(genpd->domains)` with `kfree(domains)` in the `remove` section to ensure the allocated memory is freed correctly.
