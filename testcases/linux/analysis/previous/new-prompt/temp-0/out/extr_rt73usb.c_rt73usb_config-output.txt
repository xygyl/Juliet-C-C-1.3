UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential null pointer dereference. The `libconf->conf` pointer is dereferenced multiple times (e.g., `libconf->conf->power_level`) without any prior null-check. If `libconf->conf` is null, this will result in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes `libconf->conf` is valid without verifying it. If `libconf->conf` is null, the dereference will cause a crash or undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null-check for `libconf->conf` at the beginning of the function, e.g., `if (!libconf->conf) return;`.
