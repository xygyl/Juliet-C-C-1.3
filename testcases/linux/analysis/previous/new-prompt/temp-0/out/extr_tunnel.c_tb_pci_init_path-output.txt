UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses `path->hops[1]` without verifying the size of the `hops` array. If the array has fewer than two elements, this results in out-of-bounds access, which is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `path->hops` has at least two elements but does not validate this assumption. If the array is smaller, this will lead to memory corruption or crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `path->hops` has at least two elements before accessing `path->hops[1]`. Alternatively, ensure that the caller guarantees the array size.
