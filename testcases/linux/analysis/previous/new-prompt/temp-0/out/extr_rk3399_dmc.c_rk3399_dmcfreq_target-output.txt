UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function does not handle the case where `regulator_set_voltage()` fails during the frequency scaling from high to low (`old_clk_rate > target_rate`). If the voltage adjustment fails, the function proceeds without reverting the frequency change, potentially leaving the system in an unstable state. This could lead to incorrect operation or hardware issues.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Add error handling for the case where `regulator_set_voltage()` fails during the frequency scaling from high to low. If the voltage adjustment fails, revert the frequency change to the previous rate to ensure system stability.
