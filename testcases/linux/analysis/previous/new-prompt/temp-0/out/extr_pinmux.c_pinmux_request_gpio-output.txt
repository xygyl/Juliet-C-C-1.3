UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Management Issue  
Bug Reason: If `pin_request` fails (returns a negative value), the function calls `kfree(owner)` to free the memory allocated by `kasprintf`. However, the `owner` pointer is not set to `NULL` after being freed. This can lead to a potential use-after-free issue if the pointer is accessed later in the code.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Set `owner` to `NULL` after calling `kfree(owner)` to prevent accidental use-after-free. Alternatively, ensure that `owner` is not accessed after being freed.
