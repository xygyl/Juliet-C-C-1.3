UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: In the error handling section (`err` label), the loop frees packets that were not successfully fetched. However, the loop starts at the current value of `i`, which is the index of the packet that caused the error. This means packets prior to the error are not freed, potentially leading to a memory leak.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Modify the error handling loop to start from `0` instead of `i` to ensure all packets are freed:
```c
err:
    /* Free all packets that were fetched before the error occurred. */
    for (int j = 0; j < ar_sdio->n_rx_pkts; j++)
        ath10k_sdio_mbox_free_rx_pkt(&ar_sdio->rx_pkts[j]);
```
