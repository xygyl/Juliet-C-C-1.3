UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The comparison `pcs_soc->irq < 0` might be problematic if `irq` is defined as an unsigned type, as it could always evaluate to false. This would lead to incorrect behavior in case `irq` should genuinely indicate an invalid value.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `pcs_soc->irq` is signed if the comparison is intended to handle invalid values. Alternatively, use an appropriate logic check relevant to the type of `irq`. For example, replace `pcs_soc->irq < 0` with `pcs_soc->irq == INVALID_IRQ_VALUE` if there exists a predefined constant for invalid IRQ values.
