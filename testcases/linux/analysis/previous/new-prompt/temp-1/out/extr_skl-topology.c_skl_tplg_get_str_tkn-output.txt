UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The `str_elem` pointer increments in the loop without any bounds checking on the array it derives from, `array->value`. If `array->num_elems` exceeds the allocated size of `array->value`, the code can potentially cause out-of-bounds memory access, leading to undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities. This issue arises because the loop does not validate that `array->value` is large enough to accommodate `array->num_elems`.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking to ensure that the number of elements in the vendor array does not exceed the allocated size of `array->value`. For example, introduce a check for `array->value` size against `array->num_elems` at the start of the function.
