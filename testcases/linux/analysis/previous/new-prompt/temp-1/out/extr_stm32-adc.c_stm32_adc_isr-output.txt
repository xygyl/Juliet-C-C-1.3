UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The `adc->bufi++` operation increases the buffer index, but there appears to be no verification or bound checking to ensure that `adc->bufi` does not exceed the size of `adc->buffer`. If `adc->num_conv` is larger than the allocated size of `adc->buffer`, this can result in a buffer overflow.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `adc->bufi` does not exceed the allocated size of `adc->buffer` before accessing it: 
```c
if (adc->bufi < allocated_size_of_adc_buffer) {
    adc->buffer[adc->bufi] = stm32_adc_readw(adc, regs->dr);
    adc->bufi++;
}
```
