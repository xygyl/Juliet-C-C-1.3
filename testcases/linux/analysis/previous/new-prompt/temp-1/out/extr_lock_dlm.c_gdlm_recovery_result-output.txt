Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-2/part_5/extr_lock_dlm.c_gdlm_recovery_result.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds access in `ls->ls_recover_result[jid]` if `jid >= ls->ls_recover_size` because the code does not guarantee recovery size checks across all paths. Specifically, if multiple threads or paths access `ls->ls_recover_result` without proper synchronization after the spin lock is released, a race condition may modify `ls->ls_recover_size`, leading to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: None
Bug Reason: No bug has been specifically detected in the logic or memory operations. However, UB is present.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence (1-10): 7
Fix Suggestion: Add stricter checks preventing simultaneous modifications of `ls->ls_recover_size` and ensure that `jid` is always safely within bounds before using it to access `ls->ls_recover_result`. Additionally, make sure that the spin lock covers all critical sections where `jid` or `ls` is modified.
