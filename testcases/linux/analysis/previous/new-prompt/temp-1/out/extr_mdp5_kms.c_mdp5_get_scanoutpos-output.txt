UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The `line` variable is modified in multiple conditional blocks, but the values are reset inconsistently depending on whether the condition is satisfied. Specifically, the first conditional block (`if (line < vactive_start)`) modifies `line` relative to `vactive_start`. However, there is a bug in the second conditional block where `line` is recalculated using `vfp_end` and `vactive_start` but without a proper reset or validation against the first condition. This could lead to unintended value inconsistencies or an incorrect `line` calculation, especially in boundary cases.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Introduce a clear and comprehensive logic to recalculate the `line` variable covering all relevant cases while ensuring no unintended overlaps or resets. Ensure the calculation maintains logical consistency across all conditions.
