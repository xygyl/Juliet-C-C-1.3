UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function `venus_session_set_property` suppresses an error condition (`-ENOTSUPP`) by converting it into a success scenario (returning `0`). This may lead to the calling code mistakenly assuming the operation succeeded despite the fact that the property type was not supported. This logic error could result in unintended behavior or silent failures in the system.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Return an appropriate error code or propagate the `-ENOTSUPP` error to the caller instead of silently suppressing it. This ensures clarity and allows the caller to handle the unsupported property case correctly.
