UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The `WARN` macro is used to report internal errors but does not handle the error properly if `id` is negative and records a warning. However, the check should likely ensure the `id` is within expected range properly after `idr_alloc` executes, because if the `idr_alloc` function returns any error other than the expected `-ENOSPC`, it will still execute the `return id == -ENOSPC ? -EBUSY : id;` statement. This could inadvertently lead to an incorrect response being returned if the error is unexpected.  
Bug Caused by UB: No
