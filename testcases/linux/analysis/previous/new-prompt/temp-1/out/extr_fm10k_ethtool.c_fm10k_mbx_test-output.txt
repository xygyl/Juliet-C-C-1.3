UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The loop condition `attr_flag < BIT(2 * FM10K_TEST_MSG_NESTED)` appears problematic. If `FM10K_TEST_MSG_NESTED` exceeds a certain value, this can result in an infinite loop due to overflow in the calculation of `BIT(2 * FM10K_TEST_MSG_NESTED)`. Additionally, the current logic does not seem to verify whether `BIT(2 * FM10K_TEST_MSG_NESTED)` is actually achievable without breaking constraints like unsigned integer overflow on the target platform.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Modify the loop condition to avoid potential overflow and to ensure that `attr_flag` iterates within a valid range. For example, explicitly check for overflow conditions or use a predefined maximum limit for `FM10K_TEST_MSG_NESTED`.
