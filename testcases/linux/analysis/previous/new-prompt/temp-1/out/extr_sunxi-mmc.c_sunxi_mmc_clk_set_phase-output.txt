UB Detected: No  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The logic assumes `host->cfg->clk_delays[index]` is valid for all possible values of `index`. However, an out-of-bounds array access can occur if `host->cfg->clk_delays` does not have indices matching the possible values of `index` (e.g., `SDXC_CLK_400K` or `SDXC_CLK_50M_DDR_8BIT`). This can result in unintended behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Validate `index` against the bounds of `host->cfg->clk_delays` array before accessing it. Add a guard clause to ensure `index` is within valid range:  
```c
if (index < 0 || index >= <max_indices>) {
    dev_dbg(mmc_dev(host->mmc), "Index out of bounds... returning\n");
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
