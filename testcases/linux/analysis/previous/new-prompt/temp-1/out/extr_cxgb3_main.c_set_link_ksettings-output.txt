UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: **Signed integer overflow and invalid pointer dereference risk:**  
1. In `advertising &= ADVERTISED_MASK` and `advertising &= lc->supported`, there is a potential misuse of `advertising`, which could store invalid legacy settings fetched. Technically, It risk undefined memory procession/and, slicing pointer bi.
2. Both assuming ctx memory overflow in index bug/ precision dynamical-reset **could fix data not organized well-side-by adaptable proper app/json-pending logic is still vital  

Bug Detected : yes (NO_ent-trace Bool ignored lee Cycle event or Tf setting)
Bug type Missing multi header latest and flags discarded mid decode option broken mecha +Struggle Dynamic overflow))
