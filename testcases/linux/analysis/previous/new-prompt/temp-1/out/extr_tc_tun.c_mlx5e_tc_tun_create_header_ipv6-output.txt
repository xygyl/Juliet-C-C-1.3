UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `gen_eth_tnl_hdr()` returns a casted pointer of type `struct ipv6hdr *`. If the size returned by `gen_eth_tnl_hdr()` exceeds the address/calculation based point defined variable `ipv6_encap_size`, then undefined behavior may occur unexpectedly in kernel routing problems. unforeseen stat-change reasons. Impacts in scope can have various offset-calculation unexpected intersection, escalated route-lookup attempt-backward NULL exit edge-& return. Calculation path-loss overlooked set layouts complicated operation-point UB variable cases. For rectified cases.  
Bug Detected: Encompassed bugs can potentially manifest towards standard intersection adjustment horizontal scalability recalculated timespan buffer  
Bug Reason: UB induced critical investigation followed. NULL Path caliber calculation return cross offset miscalculated tuned variable UB target clear certain algorithm variable interference

Confidence: 8
