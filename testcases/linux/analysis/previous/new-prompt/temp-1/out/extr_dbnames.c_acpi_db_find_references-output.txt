UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Casting an arbitrary integer, read using `strtoul`, to a pointer type without validation introduces undefined behavior in C. If the integer value does not correspond to a valid address within the process's memory space, accessing or dereferencing it results in undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Invalid Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The code assumes `strtoul` returns a valid address that can safely be cast to a pointer and used. However, if the input string (`object_arg`) is invalid or results in an address not mapped to the process memory space, this leads to a dereference of an invalid pointer in subsequent use.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Validate the `address` after calling `strtoul` to ensure it corresponds to a valid mapped memory address before casting it to a pointer and using it. Additionally, consider adding error handling for invalid input strings.
