UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The code uses `gdm_driver[i]` while iterating over `i` in the loop, but `gdm_driver` is likely a global pointer or array. There is no guarantee that `gdm_driver` has enough elements to safely access `gdm_driver[i]` up to `TTY_MAX_COUNT`. If the `gdm_driver` array is smaller than `TTY_MAX_COUNT`, this causes out-of-bounds access, leading to runtime errors or corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `TTY_MAX_COUNT` does not exceed the size of the `gdm_driver` array or explicitly check whether `gdm_driver[i]` is valid before using it.
