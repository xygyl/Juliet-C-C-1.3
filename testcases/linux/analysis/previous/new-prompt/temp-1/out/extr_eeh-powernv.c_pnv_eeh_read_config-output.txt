UB Detected: No  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not check if the `u32 *val` pointer is valid (non-NULL) before dereferencing it. A NULL pointer dereference can occur in the line `*val = 0xFFFFFFFF;` and when passing it to `pnv_pci_cfg_read`.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `val` is not NULL before dereferencing it. For example:
```c
if (!val)
    return PCIBIOS_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND;
```
