UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential null pointer dereference in the `strcmp` function when `var` is passed, if `var` is `NULL`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If the argument `var` is `NULL`, passing it to `strcmp` will result in undefined behavior and likely a segmentation fault, as `strcmp` does not handle `NULL` pointers.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `var` is not `NULL`, such as:  
```c
if (var == NULL) {
    return -1;  // or appropriate error handling
}
```
