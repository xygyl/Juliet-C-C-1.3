UB Detected: No
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether `heap` is within bounds of the `mmu->heap` array, leading to potential out-of-bounds access and invalid memory reads/writes when dereferencing `mmu->heap[heap]`.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds-checking to ensure that `heap` lies within the valid range for the `mmu->heap` array. For instance:
```c
if (heap < 0 || heap >= ARRAY_SIZE(mmu->heap)) {
    return; // Or handle error appropriately
}
```
