Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-2/part_5/extr_msgqueue.c_msgqueue_initialise.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing out-of-bounds array memory in the line `msgq->entries[i].next = &msgq->entries[i + 1];` when `i == NR_MESSAGES - 1`. `msgq->entries[i + 1]` accesses memory outside the bounds of the array.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The issue described in UB appears when trying to set `msgq->entries[i].next` during the final iteration of the loop.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Iterate up to `NR_MESSAGES - 1` and stop before the out-of-bounds access. For example:
```c
for (i = 0; i < NR_MESSAGES - 1; i++)
    msgq->entries[i].next = &msgq->entries[i + 1];

msgq->entries[NR_MESSAGES - 1].next = NULL;
```
