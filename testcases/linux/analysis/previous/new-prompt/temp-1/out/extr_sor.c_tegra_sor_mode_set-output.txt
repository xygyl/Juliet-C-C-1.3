UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The function does not account for cases where `vse`, `hse`, `vbe`, or `hbe` could result in values that exceed the valid range of 15 bits (0 to 0x7FFF) when applying bit masking with `(value & 0x7fff)`. This could lead to inaccurate programming of register fields if the input values `mode->vsync_end`, `mode->vsync_start`, etc., are not carefully constrained.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 7  
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to ensure that the calculated values (`vse`, `hse`, `vbe`, `hbe`, `vbs`, `hbs`) do not exceed 0x7FFF before writing them to the registers controlled by `tegra_sor_writel`. These validations will prevent incorrect register values.
