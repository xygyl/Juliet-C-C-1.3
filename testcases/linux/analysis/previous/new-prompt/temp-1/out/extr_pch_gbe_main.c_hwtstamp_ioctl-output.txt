UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Misuse of uninitialized array `station` causes undefined behavior during string copy (`strcpy`). If the copied value is longer than `station` can hold, it will result in a buffer overflow. Additionally, `station` is used uninitialized in `pch_set_station_address`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow / Uninitialized Variable  
Bug Reason: The array `station` is uninitialized and used directly in `strcpy` and `pch_set_station_address`. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential security vulnerabilities. Additionally, `strcpy` does not perform bounds checking, creating a risk of copying excessively long strings into `station`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Initialize the `station` array properly before use or ensure that the copied string fits within its bounds. Consider using safer alternatives like `strncpy` or `memcpy` to avoid potential overflows. Utilize static analysis tools to ensure these changes address the issue comprehensively.
