UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not validate the `index` parameter before using it to access the `saved_state` array. If `index` is out of bounds for the `saved_state` array, this results in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: The lack of bounds checking on the `index` parameter can lead to memory corruption or access to unintended memory locations, which is a logic flaw and a potential security vulnerability.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking for the `index` parameter to ensure it is within the valid range of the `saved_state` array. For example:
```c
if (index >= MAX_SAVED_STATE_SIZE) {
    // Handle error, e.g., return or log an error
    return;
}
```
Where `MAX_SAVED_STATE_SIZE` is the size of the `saved_state` array.
