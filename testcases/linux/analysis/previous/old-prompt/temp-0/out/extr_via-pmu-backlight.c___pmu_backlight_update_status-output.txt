UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate the `bd` pointer before dereferencing it. If `bd` is `NULL`, dereferencing `bd->props` results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that the `bd` pointer is always valid, but if `bd` is `NULL`, the dereference of `bd->props` will cause a crash. This is a logic flaw that can lead to runtime errors.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `bd` is not `NULL`. For example:  
```c
if (bd == NULL) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return an appropriate error code
}
```
