Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-0/part_5/extr_nct6775.c_store_auto_temp.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not validate the bounds of `nr` and `point` before accessing `data->auto_temp[nr][point]` or `data->REG_CRITICAL_TEMP[nr]`. If `nr` or `point` exceed the allocated dimensions of these arrays, this results in out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: The lack of bounds checking for `nr` and `point` can lead to accessing invalid memory locations, potentially causing crashes or corrupting memory. Additionally, the function assumes `data->auto_temp` and `data->REG_CRITICAL_TEMP` are properly initialized, but this is not guaranteed.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking for `nr` and `point` to ensure they are within the valid range of indices for `data->auto_temp` and `data->REG_CRITICAL_TEMP`. For example:
```c
if (nr < 0 || nr >= MAX_NR || point < 0 || point >= MAX_POINT) {
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
Where `MAX_NR` and `MAX_POINT` are constants representing the maximum dimensions of the arrays.
