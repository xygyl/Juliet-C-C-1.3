UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain any undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. It properly dereferences pointers `a` and `b` only after checking their values, and there are no operations that violate the standard (e.g., no signed integer overflow, null pointer dereference, or out-of-bounds access).  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The implementation of `strcmp` is incorrect. It does not conform to the expected behavior of the standard `strcmp` function, which should return:
- A negative value if `a` is lexicographically less than `b`.
- Zero if `a` is equal to `b`.
- A positive value if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`.

This implementation only returns `1` or `0`, and it never returns `-1`. Additionally, the condition `if (*a == 0 || *b == 0)` is redundant because the loop already terminates when either `*a` or `*b` is `0`.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Replace the implementation with the correct logic for `strcmp`:
```c
int strcmp(const char *a, const char *b)
{
    while (*a && *b) {
        if (*a != *b)
            return (*a < *b) ? -1 : 1;
        a++;
        b++;
    }
    if (*a)
        return 1;
    if (*b)
        return -1;
    return 0;
}
```
This ensures the function behaves as expected and conforms to the standard `strcmp` behavior.
