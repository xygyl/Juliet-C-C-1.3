Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-0/part_7/extr_rtw_wlan_util.c_get_rate_set.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `ratetbl2rateset` is called, and its return value is used to determine the length of the memory copy operation (`*bssrate_len`). However, there is no guarantee that the return value of `ratetbl2rateset` is within the bounds of `NumRates`. If `*bssrate_len` exceeds `NumRates`, the `memcpy` operation will result in out-of-bounds memory access, which is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: If `ratetbl2rateset` returns a value greater than `NumRates`, the `memcpy` operation will copy more bytes than the size of the `supportedrates` array, leading to a buffer overflow. This can corrupt memory and cause unpredictable behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `*bssrate_len` does not exceed `NumRates` before performing the `memcpy` operation. For example:  
```c
if (*bssrate_len > NumRates) {
    *bssrate_len = NumRates;
}
memcpy(pbssrate, supportedrates, *bssrate_len);
```
