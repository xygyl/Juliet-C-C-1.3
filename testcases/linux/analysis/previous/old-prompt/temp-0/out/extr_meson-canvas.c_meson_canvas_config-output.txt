UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The expression `(addr + 7) >> 3` and similar calculations involving `stride` may cause undefined behavior if `addr` or `stride` are such that the addition overflows the range of `u32`. Signed integer overflow is undefined behavior in C, and while `addr` and `stride` are declared as `u32` (unsigned), the addition could still result in an incorrect value if the inputs are not properly validated.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the range of `addr`, `stride`, or `height` before performing calculations. This could lead to incorrect configuration or memory corruption if the values are out of expected bounds. Additionally, the lack of validation for `canvas_index` beyond checking `canvas->used[canvas_index]` could lead to out-of-bounds access if `canvas_index` exceeds the size of the `canvas->used` array.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Add validation checks for `addr`, `stride`, and `height` to ensure they are within expected ranges and cannot cause overflow during calculations.
2. Validate `canvas_index` to ensure it is within the bounds of the `canvas->used` array.
3. Consider using safer arithmetic operations or explicitly handling overflow conditions.
