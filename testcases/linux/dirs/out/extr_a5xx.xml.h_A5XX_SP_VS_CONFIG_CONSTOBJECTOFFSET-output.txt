UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `val` is sufficiently large, it could cause a signed integer overflow (if `uint32_t` is defined as a signed type, which is platform-dependent) when shifted left by `A5XX_SP_VS_CONFIG_CONSTOBJECTOFFSET__SHIFT`. The C standard specifies that signed integer overflow is undefined behavior. Additionally, if `A5XX_SP_VS_CONFIG_CONSTOBJECTOFFSET__SHIFT` is greater than or equal to the width of `uint32_t`, this operation results in undefined behavior as shifting bits beyond the size of the type is explicitly undefined.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic
Bug Reason: There is no validation performed on `val` or `A5XX_SP_VS_CONFIG_CONSTOBJECTOFFSET__SHIFT`. If `val` is outside the valid range or the shift exceeds the bit-width of `uint32_t`, it can lead to incorrect results or undefined behavior. This could potentially cause a logic error or unintended masking.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add validation to ensure that `A5XX_SP_VS_CONFIG_CONSTOBJECTOFFSET__SHIFT` is less than the bit-width of `uint32_t` (usually 32 on most platforms) and ensure that `val` falls within the expected range so that no overflow or unintended masking occurs. Example:
```c
static inline uint32_t A5XX_SP_VS_CONFIG_CONSTOBJECTOFFSET(uint32_t val)
{
    if (A5XX_SP_VS_CONFIG_CONSTOBJECTOFFSET__SHIFT >= 32) {
        // Handle error: invalid shift value
        return 0;
    }
    return ((val) << A5XX_SP_VS_CONFIG_CONSTOBJECTOFFSET__SHIFT) & A5XX_SP_VS_CONFIG_CONSTOBJECTOFFSET__MASK;
}
```
