Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pwm-atmel-tcb.c_atmel_tcb_pwm_probe.c
UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function adheres to the C standard throughout its implementation. No signed integer overflows, null dereferences, out-of-bounds accesses, unaligned memory access, or violations of strict aliasing rules are observed.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Resource Management Bug
Bug Reason: If `clk_prepare_enable` or `pwmchip_add` fails, the Timer Counter Block (`tc`) and memory allocated for `atmel_tcb_pwm_chip` are correctly freed. However, the function does not unconditionally release resources such as the `slow_clk` in every failure path. Specifically, after allocating `tcbpwm`, a failure in `clk_prepare_enable` results in freeing `tc` without also freeing `tcbpwm`.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add proper cleanup for dynamically allocated `tcbpwm` in all failure paths where it is allocated. Example:
```c
if (tcbpwm) {
    devm_kfree(&pdev->dev, tcbpwm);
}
```
Also, ensure all resources tied to `tc` are freed in failure paths, including its `slow_clk` dependency if initialized.
