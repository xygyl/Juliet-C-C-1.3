UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing the `addr` pointer without ensuring it is valid can lead to undefined behavior. If `addr` is `NULL`, dereferencing it (via `addr[0]` to `addr[5]`) constitutes undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `addr` is `NULL`, attempting to access its elements (`addr[0]` to `addr[5]`) results in invalid memory access, leading to a potential crash. This should be explicitly checked before access.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add a null pointer check for the `addr` parameter at the beginning of the function:  
```c
if (!addr) {
    printf("Error: MAC address is null.\n");
    return;
}
```  
This ensures that `addr` is valid before any operations are performed on it.
