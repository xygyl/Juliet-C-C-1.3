UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential array out-of-bounds access due to `sx_table[round_period(period, sx_table)]` where the value returned by `round_period` is not guaranteed to be within the bounds of `sx_table`.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, potential out-of-bounds memory access  
Bug Reason: The `round_period` function's return value is used as an index into `sx_table`, but without checking bounds, there is no guarantee that the resulting index lies within the valid range of the `sx_table` array. This could lead to undefined behavior or a memory access bug.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Ensure that the value returned by `round_period` is carefully validated or clamped to lie within the valid range of the `sx_table` array's indices. For example:
```c
size_t index = round_period(period, sx_table);
if (index >= sizeof(sx_table) / sizeof(sx_table[0])) {
    // Handle out-of-bounds case or clamp index
    index = (sizeof(sx_table) / sizeof(sx_table[0])) - 1;
}
result = sx_table[index].reg_value;
```
2. Confirm that the `round_period` function itself constrains the return value such that it is always within bounds. If this is guaranteed, explicitly document this condition for clarity and safety assurance.
