UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function appears to avoid undefined behavior. All operations are within the boundaries of the C standard. Signed integers are not manipulated in ways that cause overflow, and pointers are not dereferenced in unintended manners. The function uses utility functions (`sock_i_uid` and `sock_i_ino`) on valid parameters, and there are no signs of uninitialized variables or invalid memory access.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The return value `1` in case of `nla_put_u8()` failure is peculiar. Typically, functions returning integer status codes use `0` for success and negative values for errors to allow better error propagation and debugging. Returning `1` may confuse callers of this function into interpreting it as a success code instead of an error. This is especially problematic in kernel code, where consistent error codes are crucial.

Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Replace `return 1;` with `return -1;` or another negative value, depending on the convention used in this part of the kernel. Ensure this aligns with the expectations of the caller functions.
