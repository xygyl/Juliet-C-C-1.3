UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `CP_DRAW_INDX_3_INDX_BASE__SHIFT` or `CP_DRAW_INDX_3_INDX_BASE__MASK` are defined as values that cause an invalid shift (e.g., exceeding the width of `uint32_t`), this would result in undefined behavior due to an invalid left-shift operation. Shifting by an amount greater than or equal to the width of the type (32 bits for `uint32_t`) is unspecified or UB.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow/Underflow
Bug Reason: If `CP_DRAW_INDX_3_INDX_BASE__MASK` does not cover the full range of shifted bits, the result of `(val) << CP_DRAW_INDX_3_INDX_BASE__SHIFT` might not be correctly masked, leading to incorrect results.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add validation checks for `CP_DRAW_INDX_3_INDX_BASE__SHIFT` to ensure it is within the valid range (0 to 31 for `uint32_t`) before performing the shift operation. Additionally, ensure `CP_DRAW_INDX_3_INDX_BASE__MASK` is appropriate for the defined range of shifted bits.
