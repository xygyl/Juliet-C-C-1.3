Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_video-i2c.c_video_i2c_g_parm.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `video_drvdata(filp)` returns `NULL`, dereferencing `data->frame_interval` will result in undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer. The function does not check whether `data` returned from `video_drvdata(filp)` is `NULL`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: Without validating the result of `video_drvdata(filp)`, `data->frame_interval` could be accessed even if `data` is `NULL`. This poses a risk of a null pointer dereference, which could lead to a crash or an exception.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to verify that `data` is not `NULL` before dereferencing it:  
```c
if (!data)  
    return -EINVAL;
```  
This ensures that null pointer dereferences are avoided.
