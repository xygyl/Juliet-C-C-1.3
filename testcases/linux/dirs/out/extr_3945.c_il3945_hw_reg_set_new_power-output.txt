Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_3945.c_il3945_hw_reg_set_new_power.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The loop that updates `CCK Txpower settings` assumes that `ch_info->power_info` has enough allocated entries to access elements for indices `RATE_1M_IDX_TBL` through `RATE_11M_IDX_TBL`. If the size of `power_info` is smaller than required, this results in out-of-bounds memory access, which is undefined behavior in C.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds memory access
Bug Reason: The loop updating CCK Txpower settings (`for (i = RATE_1M_IDX_TBL; i <= RATE_11M_IDX_TBL; i++)`) does not validate the size of `ch_info->power_info` array, potentially accessing invalid memory.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate the size of `ch_info->power_info` before accessing indices beyond its bounds. For example, ensure `power_info` has sufficient capacity for indices `RATE_1M_IDX_TBL` through `RATE_11M_IDX_TBL` before starting the loop.
