UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Use of `to - from` without validation may lead to unsigned integer underflow if `from > to`. An unsigned integer underflow is undefined behavior according to the C standard. While unsigned integers are technically well-defined in arithmetic wrapping, this can lead to erroneous logical behavior and UB in conditions/expression evaluation. Additionally, the return value `ret` is compared to `(to - from)` without sorting or validation that `to >= from`. This lack of validation can cause a logic flaw related to the interpretation of results.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: If the `from` parameter is greater than `to`, the subtraction `to - from` will cause an unintended wrap-around due to unsigned integer behavior, which will change the comparison logic leading to incorrect results. The function will erroneously return `UINT_MAX` in such cases, which is not necessarily correct.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add validation at the beginning of the function to ensure `from <= to`. For example:  
```c
if (from > to) {
    return UINT_MAX; // Or another appropriate error code
}
```
This ensures logical consistency and prevents unintended wrap-around when subtracting unsigned integers.
