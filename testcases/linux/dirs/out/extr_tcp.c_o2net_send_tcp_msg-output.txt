UB Detected: No
UB Reason: No undefined behavior was detected based on the provided code. The function avoids operations known to cause undefined behavior, such as dereferencing null pointers within its flow, signed integer overflow, unaligned access, or strict aliasing violations. Proper checks are performed for `sock == NULL` before using the `sock` pointer.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Issue
Bug Reason: A potential logic flaw exists in handling the return value of `kernel_sendmsg`. If `kernel_sendmsg` returns a value smaller than `total` but greater than or equal to zero, the code sets the return value as `-EPIPE` without additional context or logic to diagnose the condition further. This behavior might mask important information about partial sends and result in incorrect error handling or masking underlying issues with the socket.

It is also worth noting that the function does not account for potential retries in case of partial writes (which might happen due to transient conditions in a TCP socket).

Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Add more robust logic to handle partial sends (e.g., retry mechanisms or error diagnostics).
2. If `ret >= 0` but `ret < total`, return a special error code indicating a partial send specifically or attempt further sends, rather than a generic `-EPIPE`.
3. Log additional diagnostic information for cases where `ret >= 0` and `ret < total`, such as socket state or reaching specific system limits.
4. Consider thorough testing for scenarios where partial writes could occur due to external conditions like TCP congestion.
