UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function may cause undefined behavior if `val` is shifted left by an amount greater than or equal to the width of a `uint32_t` (typically 32 bits). Per the C standard, left-shifting a value by a number of bits greater than or equal to the width of its type results in undefined behavior. The code does not validate the value of `CP_COND_WRITE_5_WRITE_DATA__SHIFT`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: If `CP_COND_WRITE_5_WRITE_DATA__SHIFT` is not properly constrained (i.e., it exceeds or equals 32), the operation results in undefined behavior, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `CP_COND_WRITE_5_WRITE_DATA__SHIFT` is less than the width of `uint32_t` before performing the shift operation.

Example fix:
```c
static inline uint32_t CP_COND_WRITE_5_WRITE_DATA(uint32_t val)
{
	if (CP_COND_WRITE_5_WRITE_DATA__SHIFT >= 32) {
		// Handle the error case, e.g., return 0 or log an error message
		return 0;
	}
	return ((val) << CP_COND_WRITE_5_WRITE_DATA__SHIFT) & CP_COND_WRITE_5_WRITE_DATA__MASK;
}
```
