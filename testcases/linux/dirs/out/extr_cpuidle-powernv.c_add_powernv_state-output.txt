Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cpuidle-powernv.c_add_powernv_state.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function assumes that the `powernv_states` and `stop_psscr_table` arrays are sufficiently allocated for the given `index`. Accessing an index outside the bounds of these arrays results in undefined behavior as per the C standard. Additionally, potential misuse of `strlcpy` might result in its inability to null-terminate if the input `name` exceeds `CPUIDLE_NAME_LEN`.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Access  
Bug Reason: Indexing into `powernv_states[index]` and `stop_psscr_table[index]` without bounds validation may lead to out-of-bounds memory access, resulting in corruption or crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Include validation to ensure that the `index` parameter is within the bounds of the `powernv_states` and `stop_psscr_table` arrays. For example, verify `index >= 0 && index < MAX_STATES` where `MAX_STATES` represents the array bounds. Validate `name` passed into `strlcpy`, ensuring it does not exceed the buffer size (`CPUIDLE_NAME_LEN`).
