### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not appear to have any undefined behavior. Pointer dereferences (e.g., `data->regmap`) are used safely, and integer operations are bounded by their valid types (`int` and `u8`). Furthermore, there are no cases of out-of-bounds memory access or uninitialized usage. There are no violations of the C standard detected.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: In the `switch` block, the default case assigns `data->scale = 133`. However, the comment suggests this function does not expect to receive a value outside the cases of 50, 100, and 200 (`This function will never be called by users' code, so here we assume that it will never get a wrong parameter.`). This assumption is flawed. If the `val` parameter contains any unexpected value (e.g., 0, 300, or another invalid number), the scale set will be incorrect, and the function behavior may diverge from the expected logic. The assignment in the `default` case is effectively handling unanticipated input but sets a potentially invalid or unintended value.

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Add validation for the `val` parameter at the beginning of the function to ensure it is one of the expected inputs (50, 100, or 200). For example:

```c
if (val != 50 && val != 100 && val != 200)
    return -EINVAL; // Return an appropriate error code for invalid input.
```

Alternatively, if the function must handle unexpected `val` values, ensure that a meaningful scale computation or failure error code is applied in the default case.
