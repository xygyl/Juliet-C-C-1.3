UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The loop accesses `sw->ports[i]` up to `sw->config.max_port_number`, but there is no validation of whether `sw->config.max_port_number` is less than the actual size of the `sw->ports` array. If `max_port_number` exceeds the allocated size of the `ports` array, this would result in out-of-bounds access, leading to undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: The lack of size validation for `sw->ports` against `sw->config.max_port_number` could result in accessing unallocated or invalid memory locations, leading to both undefined behavior and potential memory corruption.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate `sw->config.max_port_number` against the size of the `sw->ports` array before the `for` loop. For example:
```c
unsigned int port_array_size = /* size of the ports array */;
if (sw->config.max_port_number > port_array_size) {
    /* Handle the error appropriately, e.g., by logging or aborting */
    return;
}
```
