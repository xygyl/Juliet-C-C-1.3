UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The multiplication `CPC925_SCRUB_BLOCK_SIZE * 0xFA67 / si` can cause undefined behavior when `si == 0` because division by zero is undefined in C.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Division by Zero  
Bug Reason: No check is performed to ensure that `si` is non-zero prior to using it as a divisor in the expression `CPC925_SCRUB_BLOCK_SIZE * 0xFA67 / si`, leading to the possibility of a runtime error.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `si` is non-zero before performing the division. For example:  
```c  
if (si == 0) {  
    bw = 0;  
} else {  
    bw = CPC925_SCRUB_BLOCK_SIZE * 0xFA67 / si;  
}  
```  
Alternatively, you may log or handle the case explicitly elsewhere if division by zero indicates a logic error.
