Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_smc_close.c_smc_close_shutdown_write.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function indirectly triggers undefined behavior through potential misaligned or invalid memory access, as the state of the `conn` and `sk` pointers is not fully validated before being dereferenced or accessed in functions like `cancel_delayed_work_sync()` and `smc_close_wr()`. If `conn->tx_work` or `conn` contains garbage data due to previous invalid writes or incorrect initialization, this can result in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The repeated use of `goto again` without proper checks can result in an infinite loop if `sk->sk_state` keeps erroneously flipping back to `SMC_ACTIVE` or `SMC_APPCLOSEWAIT1` due to external influence or bugs in state transitions. Additionally, if `current` is improperly initialized (e.g., `current->flags` not set up correctly), `timeout` can hold undefined values leading to unstable behavior in `smc_close_stream_wait()`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Add validation checks to ensure pointers like `conn` and `sk` are correctly initialized before dereference. Refactor the `goto again` logic to mitigate the risk of infinite loops by introducing a maximum retry limit or explicit state transition checks. Ensure `current` and related fields like `current->flags` are properly initialized before use.
