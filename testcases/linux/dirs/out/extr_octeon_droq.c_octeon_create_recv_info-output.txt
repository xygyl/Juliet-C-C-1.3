Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_octeon_droq.c_octeon_create_recv_info.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Possible null pointer dereference. The function assumes that `octeon_alloc_recv_info()` must return a valid pointer, but there’s a check for `recv_info == NULL` which explicitly implies `recv_info->recv_pkt` cannot safely be dereferenced in null check plus code already for instantiation misused follows flow mistake mishappens.
