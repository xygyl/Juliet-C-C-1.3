UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `runtime->private_data` is dereferenced (`apcm = runtime->private_data`) without a preceding null check. If `runtime` or `runtime->private_data` is `NULL`, dereferencing it results in undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: A null pointer dereference may occur if `runtime` or `runtime->private_data` is null. Since no checks are performed for these pointers, it is possible for the function to crash if called in an invalid state or with improperly initialized arguments.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer checks for `runtime` and `runtime->private_data` before dereferencing them. For example:
```c
if (!runtime || !runtime->private_data)
    return;
```
Replace lines causing UB with guarded access to prevent crashes or undefined behavior.
