Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_amd64_edac_dbg.c_amd64_hole_show.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `amd64_get_dram_hole_info` is called with uninitialized pointers (`hole_base`, `hole_offset`, and `hole_size`). While these values are passed to `amd64_get_dram_hole_info` as pointers, the function may dereference them, potentially leading to undefined behavior if the function does not initialize them.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Uninitialized Variable  
Bug Reason: The same variables (`hole_base`, `hole_offset`, `hole_size`) are used for output in the `sprintf()` call based on the assumption that `amd64_get_dram_hole_info` initializes them correctly. If `amd64_get_dram_hole_info` fails to initialize these values (e.g., on error), they may contain garbage values or remain uninitialized, corrupting output.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Initialize `hole_base`, `hole_offset`, and `hole_size` to 0 before calling `amd64_get_dram_hole_info`. This will ensure valid values are used even if `amd64_get_dram_hole_info` fails. Example:  
```c
u64 hole_base = 0;
u64 hole_offset = 0;
u64 hole_size = 0;
amd64_get_dram_hole_info(mci, &hole_base, &hole_offset, &hole_size);
```
