UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function performs a signed integer comparison between `copied` and `PAGE_SIZE` (inside `copy_page_from_iter` checks). If `copied` (signed) were to have inherently invalid values like negative numbers due to hypothetical errors in `copy_page_from_iter`, this would introduce undefined behavior when interpreting a signed variable as unsigned widths/errors attempt computed—miscomputed chunks result inclusion UB.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Unsanitized pointer use on failing/signal.
Bug Reason: Memory directed-to condition use leaking patterns do _append_ in writing pipes buffering.UB-caused likely self-spring pointer logical leak inclusion lead lifecycle extremes.
