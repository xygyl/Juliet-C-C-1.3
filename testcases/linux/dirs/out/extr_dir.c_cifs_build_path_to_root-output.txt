Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dir.c_cifs_build_path_to_root.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: **Potential memory write beyond allocated buffer size.** Specifically, the `memcpy(full_path + dfsplen + 1, vol->prepath, pplen)` uses `pplen` (computed as `strlen(vol->prepath) + 1`) for the length of bytes to copy. However, in the case where `vol->prepath` contains null terminators or if it has excess characters not directly handled, this could create erroneous behavior exceeding `dfsplen + pplen + 1`. Additionally, there is a lack of null-terminator guarantees for paths post-conversion.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: **Logic flaw and potential buffer overflow.**  
Bug Reason: The function does not handle cases where `vol->prepath` might not be properly sanitized before its `strlen()` computation. This can lead to unexpected program behavior or a potential buffer overflow at `full_path`. Moreover, reusing the `full_path` buffer without explicit bounds verification could clash with changes caused by `convert_delimiter`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Perform bounds checking after calculating `pplen` and ensure that `memcpy` operations are limited by the actual size of the allocated buffer (dfsplen + pplen + 1). Additionally, sanitize `vol->prepath` more comprehensively before use and ensure null-termination in buffers.
