### Undefined Behavior Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not include any standard-defined UB operations. Memory allocation is checked for failure (`alloc_page`), pointers are not dereferenced without proper validation, arithmetic operations follow safe checks, and structures are utilized correctly.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic error  
Bug Reason: There is a potential logic error when the `fps->crc_eof_offset` exceeds PAGE_SIZE. The `put_page` function is only called after setting `fps->crc_eof_page` to `NULL`, which clears the reference to the page. If any other code relies on `fps->crc_eof_page` being non-NULL for checking or handling, it could lead to unexpected behavior.

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Rearrange the code so `put_page(page)` is executed before `fps->crc_eof_page = NULL;` to ensure consistency in handling page references and avoid any indirect bugs that rely on this logic.
