UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function checks `p_dev->config_index` against 0 without ensuring `p_dev` is non-NULL. Dereferencing a NULL pointer leads to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If `p_dev` is passed as NULL to the function, it will cause a runtime null pointer dereference when accessing `p_dev->config_index`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that `p_dev` is not NULL, such as `if (!p_dev) return -EINVAL;`.
