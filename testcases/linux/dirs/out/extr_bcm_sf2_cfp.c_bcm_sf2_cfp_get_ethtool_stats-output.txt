UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds array access in `data[iter]`. The `data` array does not have its bounds defined in the provided code, making it unclear whether `iter = (i - 1) * s + j` remains within valid bounds of `data`. Additionally, dereferencing `data[iter]` without verifying size risks undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Array Index Out-of-Bounds  
Bug Reason: Index `iter` used for `data[iter]` may exceed `data` array bounds due to lack of size verification for `data`. Furthermore, the multiplication and addition operations in `iter` calculation amplify risks of overreach, especially when `priv->num_cfp_rules` or `s` have larger values.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate the array bounds of `data` before assigning values to `data[iter]`. For example:
```c
if (iter < data_size) {  // data_size should be defined appropriately
    data[iter] = core_readl(priv, stat->offset);
} else {
    // Handle error case or skip iteration
}
```
