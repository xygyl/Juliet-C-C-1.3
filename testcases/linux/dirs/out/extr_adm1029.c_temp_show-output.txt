Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_adm1029.c_temp_show.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Possible out-of-bounds array access. The `attr->index` used to index `data->temp` is not validated within the function, nor is it guaranteed externally to be within bounds of the array. If the value of `attr->index` is out of bounds, this causes undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The lack of bounds checking for `data->temp[attr->index]` introduces a potential array indexing issue. This could lead to crashes or incorrect behavior when accessing memory outside the array bounds.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check for `attr->index` before accessing `data->temp[attr->index]`. Ensure that `attr->index` is within the valid range of the `temp` array size.

For example:
```c
if (attr->index < ARRAY_SIZE(data->temp)) {
    return sprintf(buf, "%d\n", TEMP_FROM_REG(data->temp[attr->index]));
} else {
    return -EINVAL; // or appropriate error handling
}
```
This guarantees that any out-of-bounds index is handled safely and prevents undefined behavior.
