Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_stats.c_scale_stat.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function assumes that the pointer `stat` passed to the function is valid and non-NULL. If `stat` is NULL or invalid, dereferencing it (*stat) leads to undefined behavior. Additionally, the behavior of `ewma_add()` is unclear, as its implementation is not provided, and it might introduce other undefined behaviors depending on its internal logic.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The dereferencing of `stat` (`*stat`) could cause a null pointer dereference if the caller passes a NULL pointer. The function does not include any checks to validate that `stat` is a valid pointer.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that `stat` is not NULL:
```c
if (stat == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
Alternatively, ensure that caller-side code always passes a valid pointer to the function.
