UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `via` pointer dereference (`via[B]`) lacks a null pointer check. If `via` is `NULL`, dereferencing `&via[B]` results in undefined behavior. Additionally, the `via` array is used without verifying whether `B` is a valid index, which could lead to out-of-bounds access.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference and Potential Out-of-Bounds Access
Bug Reason: The `via` pointer might be `NULL`, causing a null pointer dereference. Furthermore, there is no validation for whether `B` is within the bounds of the `via` array, which might lead to accessing invalid memory.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
1. Add checks to ensure `via` is not `NULL` before accessing its elements:
   ```c
   if (!via) {
       // Handle error appropriately
       return;
   }
   ```

2. Check whether `B` is within the valid range for the `via` array:
   ```c
   if (B >= array_size || B < 0) {
       // Handle error appropriately
       return;
   }
   ```

By implementing these validations, both the defined behavior and logical correctness of the function would be improved.
