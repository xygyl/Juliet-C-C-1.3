UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not guarantee that the function pointer `funcs->detect_ctx` or `connector->funcs->detect` is non-NULL before dereferencing them. If `helper_private` or `funcs` member pointers are uninitialized or NULL, dereferencing them would lead to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: There is no validation of `connector->helper_private` or `connector->funcs` being NULL before using their members. If either is NULL, dereferencing members of those structures leads to a runtime null pointer dereference bug.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add checks to ensure `connector->helper_private` and `connector->funcs` are non-NULL before accessing members or calling function pointers. For example:

```c
if (!connector->helper_private || !connector->funcs)
    return connector_status_connected;

if (funcs->detect_ctx)
    return funcs->detect_ctx(connector, ctx, force);

if (connector->funcs->detect)
    return connector->funcs->detect(connector, force);

return connector_status_connected;
```
