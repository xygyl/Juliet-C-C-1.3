Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_i915_debugfs.c_plane_type.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not include a `default` case in the `switch` statement. If the `type` parameter has a value outside the enumerated cases (`DRM_PLANE_TYPE_OVERLAY`, `DRM_PLANE_TYPE_PRIMARY`, `DRM_PLANE_TYPE_CURSOR`), it invokes the `return "unknown";`. However, any invalid value of `type` could cause undefined behavior due to depending on uninitialized or invalid input, as `enum` variables are expected to be within the defined range but do not enforce that strictly.  

Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: N/A  
Bug Reason: The function does not exhibit any specific logic or memory-related bugs. Although missing a `default` case can lead to UB, the function has a fallback logic (`return "unknown";`) that likely prevents runtime bugs like crashes or incorrect logic.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a `default` case in the `switch` statement to ensure all out-of-range values for `type` that might occur are explicitly handled, which eliminates the risk of compiler-dependent behavior or accidental UB:

```c
default:
    return "unknown";
```
