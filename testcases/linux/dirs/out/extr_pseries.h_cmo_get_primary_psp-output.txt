UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function `cmo_get_primary_psp` simply returns the value of `CMO_PrPSP`, a global variable. There are no operations within this function that could trigger undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function depends entirely on `CMO_PrPSP`, which is neither defined nor initialized in the provided code snippet. If `CMO_PrPSP` is not properly initialized elsewhere, accessing it may yield an unpredictable value or trigger undefined behavior indirectly. This could result in a logic issue when the returned value is used by calling code.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the global variable `CMO_PrPSP` is defined and initialized appropriately before calling this function. Alternatively, refactor the function to avoid reliance on a potentially uninitialized global variable, such as passing the necessary value or reference explicitly.
