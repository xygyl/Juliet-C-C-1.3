Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_skl-sst-ipc.c_skl_ipc_free.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `ipc` is NULL, dereferencing `ipc->dsp` results in undefined behavior as `NULL` dereference is explicitly undefined by the C standard. This is not checked or guarded in the function.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not check whether `ipc` is NULL before dereferencing `ipc->dsp`. If the caller passes a NULL pointer, it will lead to a crash (segmentation fault).
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL check at the start of the function:
```c
if (ipc == NULL)
    return;
```
