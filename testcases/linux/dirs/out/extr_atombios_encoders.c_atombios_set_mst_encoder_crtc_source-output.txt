UB Detected: No
UB Reason: No instances of undefined behavior were identified in the function. Pointer dereferences appear to be valid, memory bounds are respected, and there are no signs of signed integer overflow or other UB-inducing constructs.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The function checks `frev` and `crev` values against specific combinations (`frev != 1 && crev != 2`), and logs an error if the condition is true, but it continues executing the function even in this case. This may cause the function to operate incorrectly with unexpected or incompatible table versions. If the table version does not match the expected format, further execution could result in unintended behavior.

Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: After logging the error (`DRM_ERROR`), the function should immediately return to prevent further execution if the table versions are not as expected:
```c
if (frev != 1 && crev != 2) {
    DRM_ERROR("Unknown table for MST %d, %d\n", frev, crev);
    return; // Abort execution
}
```
