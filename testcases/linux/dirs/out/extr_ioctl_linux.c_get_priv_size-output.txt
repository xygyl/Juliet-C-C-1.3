Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_ioctl_linux.c_get_priv_size.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing `iw_priv_type_size[type]` can cause undefined behavior if `type` exceeds the bounds of the `iw_priv_type_size` array. Array indexing out of bounds is undefined behavior in C.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: There is no validation of the `type` variable to ensure it is within the bounds of the `iw_priv_type_size` array. This can lead to out-of-bounds memory access, potentially causing a program crash or corrupting adjacent memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `type` does not exceed the bounds of the `iw_priv_type_size` array. For example:  
```c
if (type >= sizeof(iw_priv_type_size) / sizeof(iw_priv_type_size[0])) {  
    return -1; // Error handling for invalid type  
}
```
