UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The loop accesses elements of the provided `start` and `end` pointers without validating their bounds, which could lead to reading beyond allocated memory. This violates the requirements of sequence point arithmetic or valid pointer dereferencing as defined by the C standard. Additionally, dereferencing invalid or out-of-bounds memory or `NULL` results in undefined behavior. Moreover, the `submit_bh` arguments risk invalid constraints of end assumed security.
