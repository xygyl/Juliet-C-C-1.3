UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The expression `key ^ n->key` involves signed integers (`int`) for XOR operation. If `key` or `n->key` is extremely large or if the high bits are treated as signed, this operation can lead to undefined behavior due to signed integer overflow when combined with `__fls()`. Moreover, `n->key` is accessed without validating if `n` is `NULL`. A dereference of `n` without checking can cause undefined behavior if `n` is invalid.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: As identified above, when `n` is passed into `get_child(tp, get_index(key, tp))` and later dereferenced (`n->key`), there's no verification if `n` is not `NULL`. This could lead to a null pointer dereference.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add validation to ensure `n` is non-`NULL` before dereferencing. For instance:  
```c
if (n && n->key) { ... }  
```  
For the signed integer overflow, either ensure `key` and `n->key` are safely cast to unsigned types or verify the range of values to avoid overflow.
