Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pci.c_rtw_pci_request_irq.c

UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not present evidence of undefined behavior. Operations such as integer handling, pointer usage, and threading functions are used properly, and no violations of the C standard appear in the provided code.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Resource Leak  
Bug Reason: If the call to `devm_request_threaded_irq` fails, the function will return an error code without releasing the successfully allocated IRQ vectors via `pci_free_irq_vectors`. This results in a leak of allocated IRQ resources.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a call to `pci_free_irq_vectors(pdev)` before returning the error code if `devm_request_threaded_irq` fails. This ensures proper cleanup of resources allocated by `pci_alloc_irq_vectors`.  

Corrected Code Example:
```c
ret = devm_request_threaded_irq(rtwdev->dev, pdev->irq,
                                rtw_pci_interrupt_handler,
                                rtw_pci_interrupt_threadfn,
                                IRQF_SHARED, KBUILD_MODNAME, rtwdev);
if (ret) {
    rtw_err(rtwdev, "failed to request irq %d\n", ret);
    pci_free_irq_vectors(pdev);  // Release allocated IRQ vectors
    return ret;  // Return the error code
}
```
