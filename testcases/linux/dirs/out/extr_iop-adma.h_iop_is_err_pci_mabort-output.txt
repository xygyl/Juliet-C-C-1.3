UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `test_bit` macro is invoked with `&status`, which is a pointer to an `unsigned long`. Depending on the implementation of `test_bit` and the platform, casting a pointer to a `long *` and accessing bits within `unsigned long` indirectly may violate strict aliasing rules, as `test_bit` likely expects the address of an `unsigned long`. This constitutes undefined behavior. Additionally, passing a type mismatched address can lead to misaligned memory access depending on `_test_bit()` interpretations.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw/Strict Aliation przypadku. --- Fix Suggestion
