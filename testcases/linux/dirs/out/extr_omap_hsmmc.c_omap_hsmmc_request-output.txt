### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason:  
Upon analysis, the function does not contain any operations that result in undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. The usage of pointers, conditional branches, and function calls is compliant with the standard and no patterns matching typical UB cases (e.g., invalid pointer dereferences, uninitialized access, signed integer overflow, etc.) are found directly in the code.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason:  
1. **BUG_ON Macros**: The `BUG_ON` macro causes a kernel panic when the condition evaluates to true. In this function, there are assertions like `BUG_ON(host->req_in_progress)` and `BUG_ON(host->dma_ch != -1)`. While these assertions ensure invariants, they are typically used as a last-resort debugging mechanism and could halt the entire system if these conditions fail, which may indicate poor error handling strategy in production environments.

2. **DMA Channel Check (`BUG_ON(host->dma_ch != -1)`)**: The function checks whether the DMA channel is valid with `BUG_ON(host->dma_ch != -1)`. However, relying solely on `BUG_ON` without proper fallback is risky since it does not handle an invalid DMA channel gracefully but directly crashes the kernel.

3. **Unconditional Update of `host->reqs_blocked`**: The line `if (host->reqs_blocked) host->reqs_blocked = 0;` unconditionally resets `host->reqs_blocked`. This may lead to loss of information regarding the state of the host, which could potentially introduce unexpected behavior if requests were actually blocked and need to remain blocked.

Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Replace `BUG_ON` with error handling strategies that gracefully recover or log the issue without halting the kernel.
   Example:  
   ```c
   if (host->req_in_progress || host->dma_ch != -1) {
       pr_err("Invalid state detected in omap_hsmmc_request\n");
       return;
   }
   ```

2. Add comments or conditional checks to ensure `host->reqs_blocked` is reset only when appropriate. A deeper review of logic might be necessary.

3. If `WARN_ON(host->mrq != NULL)` fails, ensure that potential side effects of an invalid `host->mrq` are mitigated gracefully instead of warning without action.
