UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function assumes the `event` pointer is non-NULL without explicitly checking it. If `event` is ever passed as NULL, the `memset()` call causes undefined behavior due to dereferencing a NULL pointer.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `event` is NULL, `memset()` will attempt to access memory at address `NULL`, leading to a program crash. This is a logic bug caused by the lack of a null-check before operating on `event`.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null-check at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (event == NULL) {
    return;  // Or handle the error appropriately.
}
```
