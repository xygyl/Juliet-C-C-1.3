UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences a potentially null pointer `edid` via calls to several functions (`drm_connector_update_edid_property`, `cec_notifier_set_phys_addr_from_edid`, `drm_add_edid_modes`, `drm_detect_monitor_audio`), immediately following the `kfree(edid)` statement without verifying if the allocation of `edid` was successful. Dereferencing a null pointer results in undefined behavior as per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw, NULL pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If `edid` fails to be allocated or initialized (e.g., by `drm_do_get_edid` returning `NULL`), the subsequent calls will cause a null pointer dereference. Additionally, `kfree(edid)` should not occur right before accessing the memory allocated to `edid`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for `edid` after it is obtained from `drm_do_get_edid`. If `edid` is `NULL`, immediately return without proceeding further. Example:
```c
edid = drm_do_get_edid(connector, read_edid_block, priv);
if (!edid) {
    dev_warn(&priv->hdmi->dev, "failed to read EDID\n");
    return 0;
}
```
Also, ensure `kfree(edid)` occurs after all usage of the `edid` pointer is complete.
