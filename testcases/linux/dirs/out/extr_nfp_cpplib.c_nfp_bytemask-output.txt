Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nfp_cpplib.c_nfp_bytemask.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function performs an unchecked bit shift operation when calculating the return value for `width == 4`, `width == 2`, and `width == 1`. The expression `addr & 4`, `addr & 6`, and `addr & 7` can produce values greater than the bit-width of `u8` (unsigned 8-bit integer). Shifting beyond the storage size of the resulting type (u8) leads to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The calculation for bit shifts based on low bits of `addr` does not account for wrapping or exceeding the size of u8. Additionally, incorrect shifts might lead to unintended masking results when `width` is not handled properly. This is both a bug and a consequence of UB.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Use a bitmask (`&`) to sanitize the `addr & n` result before shifting, ensuring it is within the valid range (0 to 7 for 7-bit shifts). Explicitly cast or handle edge cases to avoid overflows and ensure correctness. Example correction for bit shift:  
```c
static u8 nfp_bytemask(int width, u64 addr)  
{  
    if (width == 8)  
        return 0xff;  
    else if (width == 4)  
        return 0x0f << ((addr & 0x07) % 4);  
    else if (width == 2)  
        return 0x03 << ((addr & 0x07) % 2);  
    else if (width == 1)  
        return 0x01 << (addr & 0x07);  
    else  
        return 0;  
}  
```
