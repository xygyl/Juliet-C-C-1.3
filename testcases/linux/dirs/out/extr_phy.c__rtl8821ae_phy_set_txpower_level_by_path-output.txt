UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior if `array` is null. The function does not validate the `array` pointer before dereferencing it in the loop (`array[i]`), which could lead to undefined behavior if `array` is null.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If the `array` pointer is null (or uninitialized), dereferencing it (`array[i]`) will result in a null pointer dereference, causing a runtime error or crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add validation for the `array` pointer at the beginning of the function. For example: `if (!array) { return; }`.
