UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not validate the input pointers `pn1` and `pn2` before dereferencing them. If either `pn1` or `pn2` is `NULL` or points to an invalid memory location, dereferencing them results in undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The potential for dereferencing a `NULL` pointer exists, as the input arguments are directly used without checks. If `NULL` is passed for either `pn1` or `pn2`, the program will crash or exhibit undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion:
Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that `pn1` and `pn2` are non-NULL:
```c
if (pn1 == NULL || pn2 == NULL) {
    return -1; // or some other appropriate error handling
}
```
Additionally, ensure `len` is non-negative or consistent with the range of the input buffers to prevent out-of-bounds memory access. E.g.,
```c
if (len <= 0) {
    return -1; // Invalid length
}
```
