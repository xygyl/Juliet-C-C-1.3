### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing a null pointer may occur. The function does not validate that `call`, `call->peer`, or `sock` are non-NULL before dereferencing them. If `call` or `call->peer` is NULL, `call->peer->srx` leads to undefined behavior when dereferenced.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `call`, `call->peer`, and `_srx` are always valid non-NULL pointers. Without proper checks, passing a NULL value for any of these parameters will cause runtime errors, specifically null pointer dereference.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Additional Details:
The function does not include any error handling or validation logic for the input pointers. This means the caller must ensure that these pointers are valid prior to invoking the function. Any misuse or error by the caller could lead to crashes or undefined behavior.

### Confidence:
High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Introduce validation checks for `call`, `call->peer`, and `_srx` at the beginning of the function:  
```c
void rxrpc_kernel_get_peer(struct socket *sock, struct rxrpc_call *call,
                           struct sockaddr_rxrpc *_srx)
{
    if (!call || !call->peer || !_srx) {
        // Optionally log an error or handle it appropriately
        return;
    }
    *_srx = call->peer->srx;
}
```  
Adding these checks ensures that the function handles invalid input gracefully, preventing UB and bugs.
