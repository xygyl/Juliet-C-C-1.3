Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sc2731_charger.c_sc2731_charger_stop_charge.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The parameter `info` in the function `sc2731_charger_stop_charge` is a pointer and its dereferencing (e.g., `info->regmap`, `info->base`) is done without first validating that the pointer is non-NULL. If a NULL pointer is passed to the function, dereferencing it causes undefined behavior as per the C standard. 

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If this function is called with the `info` parameter as NULL, it will result in a crash or undefined behavior when attempting to calculate `info->base + SC2731_CHG_CFG0` or accessing `info->regmap`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `info` is not NULL. For example:
```c
if (info == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
