UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible out-of-bounds array access in `ctl_freqbin[edge]` if `ctl_freqbin` is shorter than `num_edges`. This leads to undefined behavior when `ctl_freqbin[edge]` is dereferenced past its allocated range.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: There is insufficient validation to ensure that `ctl_freqbin` array has a length matching or exceeding `num_edges`, potentially causing out-of-bounds access. This logic flaw can lead to runtime errors, such as segmentation faults.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds-checking to ensure `edge < sizeof(ctl_freqbin)/sizeof(ctl_freqbin[0])` and that the array has enough elements to meet the expectations of `num_edges`. Alternatively, validate the input before use.
