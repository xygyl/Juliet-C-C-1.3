Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_txrx.c_tx_policy_upload.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses `memcpy(dst->rate_count_indices, src->tbl, sizeof(dst->rate_count_indices));` without validating that `src->tbl` or `dst->rate_count_indices` point to sufficiently allocated memory. This can lead to undefined behavior if these pointers are invalid or improperly sized for the `sizeof(dst->rate_count_indices)` operation.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Access Violation
Bug Reason: An unchecked `memcpy` operation can lead to memory corruption if the source (`src->tbl`) or destination (`dst->rate_count_indices`) doesn't have sufficient allocated space as expected. This could corrupt nearby memory regions or cause runtime crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate the sizes and pointers before performing the `memcpy` operation. Use runtime checks to ensure `src->tbl` and `dst->rate_count_indices` are valid memory regions and appropriately sized. For example:
```c
if (!src->tbl || sizeof(src->tbl) < sizeof(dst->rate_count_indices)) {
    // Handle error or fallback logic
}
```
