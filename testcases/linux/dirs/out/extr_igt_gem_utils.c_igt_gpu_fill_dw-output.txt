UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: There is a risk of dereferencing invalid pointers in several places due to the potential handling of `IS_ERR` objects (`batch`, `rq`). If these objects are invalid (error codes returned as pointers), operations such as `batch->node.start`, `batch->node.size`, `batch->obj`, etc., involve dereferencing these invalid pointers, which leads to undefined behavior. Additionally, signed integer overflow may occur when ERR casting values inadvertently under certain error-return mechanisms.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference/UAF (Use After Free)
Bug Reason: The logic assumes that after `IS_ERR(batch)` fails, the code resolves issues but inadvertently calls unpin/unlock _without correction post-error cleanup correctly_, improperly deferring leftover pin/alloc and closing overlapping spaces misaligned batch sequence.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
