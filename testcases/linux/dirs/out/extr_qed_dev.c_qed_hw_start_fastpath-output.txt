### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function avoids undefined behavior by ensuring proper null-checks for pointers (e.g., `p_ptt` and `p_hwfn->p_rdma_info`) and uses correct memory access. No signed integer overflows, out-of-bounds accesses, or other sources of undefined behavior are evident.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The code performs operations on `p_hwfn->p_rdma_info` without verifying if the pointer is valid or non-null. Though there is an implicit null-check (`p_hwfn->p_rdma_info`), dereferencing `p_hwfn->p_rdma_info->active` could still lead to a null pointer dereference if `p_hwfn->p_rdma_info` is unexpectedly null. While it does check for `!p_ptt` earlier, other parts do not explicitly protect against invalid pointer dereference for the `p_rdma_info` field.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Before accessing `p_hwfn->p_rdma_info->active`, explicitly check if `p_hwfn->p_rdma_info` is null. For example:
```c
if (p_hwfn->p_rdma_info && p_hwfn->p_rdma_info->active && p_hwfn->b_rdma_enabled_in_prs)
    qed_wr(p_hwfn, p_ptt, p_hwfn->rdma_prs_search_reg, 0x1);
```
This ensures robustness in cases where `p_hwfn->p_rdma_info` might be null.
