**UB Analysis**  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The expression `(dce6_dram_bandwidth_for_display(wm) / wm->num_heads)` may result in undefined behavior if `wm->num_heads` equals `0`. Division by zero is undefined in the C language standard.

**Bug Analysis**  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function does not check whether `wm->num_heads` is zero before performing the division `dce6_dram_bandwidth_for_display(wm) / wm->num_heads`. If `wm->num_heads` is zero, this will cause a runtime error due to division by zero. Additionally, this bug causes the undefined behavior mentioned above.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add a guard clause to ensure `wm->num_heads` is not zero before performing the division. For example:  
```c
if (wm->num_heads == 0)
    return false; // or handle the error appropriately
```
Alternatively, review the design of the function to ensure `num_heads` is validated earlier in the program.
