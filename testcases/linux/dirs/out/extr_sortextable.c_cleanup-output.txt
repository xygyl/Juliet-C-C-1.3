Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sortextable.c_cleanup.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential use of uninitialized variables. The `ehdr_curr` and `sb.st_size` variables are used in the `munmap` function without any guarantee they have been properly initialized. If `ehdr_curr` or `sb.st_size` is uninitialized, this results in undefined behavior when passed to `munmap`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The code assumes `ehdr_curr` and `sb.st_size` are valid if `mmap_failed` is false, but there is no guarantee these variables were initialized. This can result in an invalid `munmap` call, causing a failure during cleanup.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `ehdr_curr` and `sb.st_size` are initialized before they are passed to `munmap`. Alternatively, add a validation check for the variables before invoking `munmap`, such as verifying that `ehdr_curr` is not `NULL` and that `sb.st_size` is a valid size (e.g., greater than zero).

Example fix:
```c
if (!mmap_failed && ehdr_curr != NULL && sb.st_size > 0)
    munmap(ehdr_curr, sb.st_size);
close(fd_map);
```
