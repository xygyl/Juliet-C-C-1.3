### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: 
- The function relies on external inputs `avi` and `vendor`, which are passed by pointer but not explicitly checked for `NULL` or validity before dereferencing in `pack_hdmi_infoframe`. If these pointers are `NULL`, dereferencing would cause undefined behavior.
- The arrays `avi` and `vendor` are accessed based on the sizes `avi_size` and `vendor_size`. However, if these sizes are incorrect relative to the actual array memory boundaries, it may lead to out-of-bounds memory access, which is another form of undefined behavior.
- Implicit reliance on the behavior of `pack_hdmi_infoframe`, which is not included in the code excerpt, introduces potential UB if that function performs invalid operations with these inputs.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference, Potential Out-of-Bounds Access 
Bug Reason: 
- If `avi` or `vendor` pointers are `NULL` or invalid, the function will dereference them to compute the HDMI infoframe, leading to a null pointer dereference bug.
- If `avi_size` or `vendor_size` exceeds the valid limits of the arrays pointed to by `avi` or `vendor`, the function may write invalid data or crash due to out-of-bounds access. This could result in corrupted information frames or memory corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

### Confidence:
Confidence: Medium  
The UB and bugs are likely to occur based on the provided code, especially since external inputs are not validated, but we cannot confirm all scenarios without seeing the caller code or `pack_hdmi_infoframe`.

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Add validation for `avi` and `vendor` pointers and their sizes:
   ```c
   if (!avi && avi_size != 0) {
       return; // Or handle error appropriately
   }

   if (!vendor && vendor_size != 0) {
       return; // Or handle error appropriately
   }
   ```
   This ensures that null inputs with nonzero sizes do not lead to invalid memory accesses.

2. Additional boundary checks in `pack_hdmi_infoframe` should ensure any memory access respects the sizes provided.

3. Optionally, assert the consistent behavior of arrays before processing:
   ```c
   assert(avi_size <= VALID_MAX_SIZE);
   assert(vendor_size <= VALID_MAX_SIZE);
   ```
