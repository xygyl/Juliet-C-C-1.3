Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_i40iw_ctrl.c_i40iw_sc_cceq_create.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `i40iw_sc_cceq_create` is recursively invoked inside itself without a base case to terminate the recursion. This could result in infinite recursion, stack overflow, and undefined behavior as per the C standard (execution exceeding the stack's size limits).  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw, Stack Overflow  
Bug Reason: Recursive invocation of `i40iw_sc_cceq_create` directly within its own definition without a termination condition leads to stack exhaustion. This is a flawed design logic that makes the function unusable in practice.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
To avoid infinite recursion and stack overflow:  
1. Rename either the function being called (`i40iw_sc_ceq_create`) or the enclosing function `i40iw_sc_cceq_create` to prevent confusion.  
2. Analyze and confirm if a different function was intended to be invoked instead of self-reference. If self-reference is intended, define a proper termination/base case for the recursion.
