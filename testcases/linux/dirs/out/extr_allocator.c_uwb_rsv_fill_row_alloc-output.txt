Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_allocator.c_uwb_rsv_fill_row_alloc.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code lacks a clear range-check for the index `(col * UWB_NUM_ZONES + mas)` when accessing `bm` array. If `UWB_NUM_ZONES` or `mas` assumes a value leading to an index out-of-bounds, this results in undefined behavior due to invalid memory access.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: The index `(col * UWB_NUM_ZONES + mas)` can exceed the allocated size of the `bm` array if `mas` or `col` surpass assumed boundaries, leading to illegal memory access. Additionally, failure to verify array sizes of `ri->avail` and `bm` may allow for accessing unallocated or invalid memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
- Add range checks to ensure `(col * UWB_NUM_ZONES + mas)` does not access memory outside the bounds of `bm`. For example:
  ```c
  if ((col * UWB_NUM_ZONES + mas) >= sizeof(bm) || mas < 0) {
      // Handle invalid access, e.g., by breaking or skipping further processing
  }
  ```  
- Ensure that `ri->avail` and `bm` are correctly allocated to the expected sizes before use. Validate their dimensions relative to `UWB_MAS_PER_ZONE` and `UWB_NUM_ZONES`.
