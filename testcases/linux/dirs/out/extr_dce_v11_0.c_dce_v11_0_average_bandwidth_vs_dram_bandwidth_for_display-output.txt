UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Division by zero occurs if `wm->num_heads` is zero. The C standard defines division by zero as undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug (division by zero possibility)  
Bug Reason: Before performing the division `(dce_v11_0_dram_bandwidth_for_display(wm) / wm->num_heads)`, the function does not check if `wm->num_heads` is zero. If `wm->num_heads` were zero, this would result in undefined behavior and potentially cause a crash or other unpredictable behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Before performing the division, add a check to ensure `wm->num_heads` is not zero:
```c
if (wm->num_heads == 0) {
    return false;  // or handle the error appropriately
}
```
This prevents division by zero and avoids the undefined behavior.
