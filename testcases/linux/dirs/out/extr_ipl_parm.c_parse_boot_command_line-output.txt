UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function calls `kstrtobool(val, &enabled)` without checking if `val` is null. If `val` is null, passing it to `kstrtobool` results in undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer. Additionally, C pointers like `args`, `param`, and `val` rely on indirect logic for initialization and updates, and if `next_arg` operates incorrectly or returns null pointers, subsequent dereferences could invoke undefined behavior.
  
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: `val` is accessed without checking for nullity in the `if (!strcmp(param, "noexec"))` and `if (!strcmp(param, "facilities") && val)` blocks. If null values are returned from `next_arg` or provided via `val`, this leads to null pointer dereference errors when the memory at the location is attempted to be read.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `val` before dereferencing it in every `strcmp` block where `val` is expected, e.g.:
```c
if (!strcmp(param, "noexec") && val != NULL) {
    rc = kstrtobool(val, &enabled);
    if (!rc && !enabled)
        noexec_disabled = 1;
}

if (!strcmp(param, "facilities") && val != NULL)
    modify_fac_list(val);
```
This ensures that `val` is valid before being used as a parameter or dereferenced.
