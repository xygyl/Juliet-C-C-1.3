Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_ppevvmath.h_SolveQuadracticEqn.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Integer Division by Zero**: The function does not explicitly check whether `A` is zero before performing division operations on it during the calculation of `root_first` and `root_second`. Dividing by zero leads to undefined behavior according to the C standard.  
2. **Ignoring Potentially Negative Discriminant**: The function calculates the square root of the discriminant (`fSqrt(temp)` where `temp = fSubtract(fGetSquare(B), temp)`) without verifying if `temp` is non-negative. If `temp` becomes negative, it can lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results depending on how `fSqrt` handles negative inputs.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason:  
1. **Division by Zero**: If the coefficient `A` is zero, the quadratic equation is degenerate, and both divisions by `A` will produce erroneous results. Additionally, no logic exists to handle this special case.  
2. **Negative Square Root Handling**: In the instance where `temp` is negative (e.g., when `B^2 < 4AC`), the function assumes the square root computation (`fSqrt`) is valid. If `fSqrt` does not properly handle negative inputs, it can lead to incorrect values or failure. This is also a logic flaw as the physical scenario of a negative discriminant (complex roots in mathematics) isn't supported or handled.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add a check to ensure `A` is non-zero before performing divisions by `A`. For example:  
   ```c
   if (A == ConvertToFraction(0)) {
       // Handle degenerate equation (e.g., set Roots to an error code or return)
       return;
   }
   ```  

2. Validate the discriminant (`temp = fSubtract(fGetSquare(B), temp)`) before passing it to `fSqrt`. Ensure that `temp` is non-negative:  
   ```c
   if (GreaterThan(ConvertToFraction(0), temp)) {
       // Handle invalid square root (e.g., set Roots to NaN or indicate complex roots)
       return;
   }
   ```  
These checks will prevent both undefined behavior and logical errors, ensuring the function operates correctly in edge cases.
