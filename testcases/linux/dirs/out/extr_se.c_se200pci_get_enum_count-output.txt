Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_se.c_se200pci_get_enum_count.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential use of an out-of-bounds array index. The expression `se200pci_cont[n]` assumes that `se200pci_cont` contains at least `n+1` valid entries. If `n` is out of bounds for this array, accessing `se200pci_cont[n]` causes undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: Lack of bounds checking before accessing `se200pci_cont[n]` makes the function susceptible to accessing invalid memory or causing a segmentation fault if `n` exceeds the bounds of the `se200pci_cont` array.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking for `n` to make sure it lies within the valid range of indices for the `se200pci_cont` array. For example:
```c
if (n < 0 || n >= ARRAY_SIZE(se200pci_cont))
    return 0;
``` 
Ensure `ARRAY_SIZE(se200pci_cont)` is properly defined as the size of the `se200pci_cont` array.
