UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `VOLTAGE_SCALE` is such that `(vddc * VOLTAGE_SCALE)` exceeds the maximum value of `uint16_t`, it results in an integer overflow. Signed integer overflow is undefined behavior in C.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer overflow
Bug Reason: Multiplication of `vddc` and `VOLTAGE_SCALE` can exceed the range of `uint16_t`, potentially leading to incorrect computation and unpredictable behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `(vddc * VOLTAGE_SCALE)` is calculated using a wider type (`uint32_t` or `unsigned long`) to avoid overflow, e.g., by casting one of the operands before multiplication: `(uint32_t)vddc * VOLTAGE_SCALE`. Add safety checks to validate input ranges.
