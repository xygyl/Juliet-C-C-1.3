Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_be_main.c_fw_major_num.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The variable `fw_ver` is passed to `sscanf` without explicit validation for `NULL`. Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer in `sscanf` would lead to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: If `fw_ver` is `NULL`, it results in undefined behavior because `sscanf` internally dereferences the pointer to read from the memory location. It could crash the program or exhibit unintended behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a `NULL` check for `fw_ver` before passing it to `sscanf`. For example:
```c
if (fw_ver == NULL)
    return 0;
```
