UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible signed integer overflow in the expression `(1 << var)` if `var >= sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT`, leading to undefined behavior as per the C standard. The `var` value is not validated to ensure it falls within a range suitable for left-shifting.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The left-shift operation `(1 << var)` could lead to undefined behavior because the C standard specifies that left-shifting a signed or unsigned integer beyond its width is undefined. Additionally, this could cause memory corruption or erroneous behavior when `var` is too large.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:
1. Validate the value of `var` to ensure it is less than `sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT` before performing the left-shift operation.
   ```c
   if (var >= sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT || var < 0) {
       return -EINVAL;
   }
   ```
2. Alternatively, consider using `uint32_t` instead of `int` for the operation and ensure shifts are bounded.

3. Add unit tests to confirm the correctness of the function for edge cases where `var` is at its boundary values.
