Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_HalBtc8723b1Ant.c_halbtc8723b1ant_IsWifiStatusChanged.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses uninitialized static variables (`bPreWifiBusy`, `bPreUnder4way`, `bPreBtHsOn`) without explicitly initializing them, which leads to undefined behavior as their initial values are indeterminate. This can result in unpredictable program behavior when performing comparisons.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The logic relies on comparisons involving uninitialized values of the static variables (`bPreWifiBusy`, `bPreUnder4way`, `bPreBtHsOn`). This may result in incorrect computation of whether the WiFi status has changed due to undefined or garbage values in these variables.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Initialize the static variables explicitly to known values (e.g., `false`) at the point of definition:  

```c
static bool bPreWifiBusy = false;
static bool bPreUnder4way = false;
static bool bPreBtHsOn = false;
```  

This ensures that the variables always start in a valid and predictable state.
