UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The value retrieved from `data_frame[(*data_index)++]` is used directly as `length` without validating that `data_index` stays within valid array bounds. Accessing beyond the allocated `data_frame` results in undefined behavior. Additionally, dereferencing and using `&data_frame[*data_index]` without validating the bounds can lead to out-of-bounds memory access and undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access
Bug Reason: The function does not ensure that `data_index` is within valid bounds for `data_frame`. If `received_len` or `*data_index` is malformed or manipulated externally, the assignment and dereference operations can access invalid memory, causing crashes or incorrect behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate that `*data_index` is within bounds before accessing `data_frame[(*data_index)++]`. Also, ensure `data_index + length <= received_len` before dereferencing `&data_frame[*data_index]`. Implement proper bounds-checking to prevent access to invalid memory.
