UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code dereferences `pCoexDm` without verifying whether it is a valid pointer (e.g., not `NULL`). If `pCoexDm` were uninitialized or `NULL`, this would lead to undefined behavior due to invalid memory access. This violates the requirement of valid pointer dereferencing as per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `pCoexDm` is `NULL`, the code will cause a null pointer dereference when accessing `pCoexDm->curLps`, `pCoexDm->curRpwm`, `pCoexDm->preLps`, or `pCoexDm->preRpwm`. This could result in a crash or unpredictable behavior at runtime.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `pCoexDm` is not `NULL` before any dereference operations. For example:

```c
if (pCoexDm == NULL) {
    BTC_PRINT(
        BTC_MSG_ALGORITHM, 
        ALGO_TRACE_FW, 
        "[BTCoex], pCoexDm is NULL, aborting execution!\n"
    );
    return;
}
```

This ensures safe access and avoids crashes due to null pointer dereferencing.
