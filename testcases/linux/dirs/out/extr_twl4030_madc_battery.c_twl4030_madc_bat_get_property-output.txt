UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Access to `bat->pdata` and `bat->pdata->capacity` without verifying whether `bat` and `bat->pdata` are non-NULL introduces undefined behavior if `bat` or `bat->pdata` is NULL. Dereferencing a NULL pointer is undefined behavior as per the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The code does not verify whether `bat` returned by `power_supply_get_drvdata(psy)` or `bat->pdata` is NULL before dereferencing them. If either pointer is NULL, the application will face a crash, leading to a loss of functionality.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add null-pointer checks for `bat` and `bat->pdata` at the beginning of the function. For example:  
```c  
if (!bat || !bat->pdata)  
    return -EINVAL;  
```
