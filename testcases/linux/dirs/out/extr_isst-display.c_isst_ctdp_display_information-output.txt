UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses `snprintf()` without validating the sizes or bounds of the `ctdp_level->trl_sse_active_cores`, `ctdp_level->trl_avx_active_cores`, and `ctdp_level->trl_avx_512_active_cores` arrays. Accessing beyond their bounds would lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, there is no validation to ensure that these arrays are properly initialized. Reading uninitialized memory (e.g., elements of these arrays) results in UB.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic and Memory-related Bug  
Bug Reason: There is a potential out-of-bounds access for the arrays `trl_sse_active_cores`, `trl_avx_active_cores`, and `trl_avx_512_active_cores` when indexing with `j`. These arrays' assumed size must precisely match the loop bounds (0 to 7). Without explicit checks or guarantees about the size of the arrays, this can cause buffer overflow during array access. This can corrupt or read invalid data. There is also no guarantee that the `core_cpumask` or `core_cpumask_size` values are valid, which could result in invalid memory access.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add explicit checks to ensure that arrays such as `trl_sse_active_cores`, `trl_avx_active_cores`, and `trl_avx_512_active_cores` have at least 8 elements before accessing them in the loop.  
2. Ensure that the data returned in `core_cpumask` and `core_cpumask_size` is valid and initialized before being used in `printcpumask()` or `printcpulist()`.  
3. Verify that the fields inside `ctdp_level` structures (e.g., `buckets_info`, `fact_support`) are initialized before use.  
4. Introduce bounds checks inside the loops to prevent any accidental overruns of these array elements.
