UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses `INTEL_GEN(i915)` and other macro checks (`IS_GEN9_LP(i915)`, `IS_HASWELL(i915)`, etc.) with the `i915` pointer without verifying whether `i915` is `NULL`. If `i915` is `NULL`, it would result in a null pointer dereference, which is undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If the function is called with `i915` as `NULL`, it could dereference the `NULL` pointer during the macro evaluations, leading to a runtime crash and undefined behavior in the system.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add an explicit check at the beginning of the function to verify whether `i915` is `NULL`. If `i915` is `NULL`, return immediately or handle the error appropriately, e.g., adding:
```c
if (i915 == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
This check ensures the function does not proceed with `NULL` dereference.
