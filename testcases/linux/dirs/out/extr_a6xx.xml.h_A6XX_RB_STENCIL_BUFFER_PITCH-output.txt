UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The operation `(val >> 6)` shifts the `uint32_t` value `val` to the right by 6 bits. If `val` is less than 6 bits, right-shifting leads to potentially undefined behavior because the standard requires that right-shifting a bit beyond the width of the type (e.g., `>> 32` for a 32-bit integer) is undefined. However, the specific context where this occurs might depend on the caller of the function; the shift amount being safe is assumed but not guaranteed.

Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: N/A
Bug Reason: There are no apparent logic, memory-related, or other issue types in the implementation itself. The function performs a bit-shift operation and combines it with logical calculations using masks and shifts without obvious flaws.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Validate the `val` input inside the function to ensure it is safe for a right shift by 6 bits (e.g., assert the input is not too small). Add a range check like `if (val < (1 << 6))` for safety or defensive programming.
