UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: `snprintf()` invocation risks undefined behavior if `len` is greater than the actual size of `bp->irq_tbl[0].name`. Since `sizeof(bp->irq_tbl[0].name)` determines the maximum object size, passing `len` that inaccurately exceeds it could result in writing out of bounds, causing undefined behavior as per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: There's no guarantee that `len` matches the actual size of `bp->irq_tbl[0].name`. A mismatch can lead to a buffer overflow if `snprintf` writes more data than allocated for `bp->irq_tbl[0].name`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate the actual size of `bp->irq_tbl[0].name` using the correct array size directly (e.g., `sizeof(bp->irq_tbl[0].name)` instead of assigning it to `len`). This ensures that `snprintf()` does not exceed the allocated buffer size.
```

Explanation:
- UB arises due to `snprintf()` being used without proper verification that `len` reflects the actual size of the target array `bp->irq_tbl[0].name`. If `len` is improperly set or mismatched, buffer overflow and undefined behavior can result.
- The identified bug stems from the same issue and directly points to potential buffer overflow scenarios.
