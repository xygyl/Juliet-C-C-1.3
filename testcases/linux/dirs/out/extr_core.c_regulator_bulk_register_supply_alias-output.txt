Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_core.c_regulator_bulk_register_supply_alias.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: **Out‐of‐bounds array access**. The function accesses `id[i]` and `alias_id[i]` in the `dev_err()` call after breaking out of the for-loop due to `ret < 0`. If `i == num_id` upon breaking the loop, this constitutes undefined behavior because `id` and `alias_id` arrays are being indexed out of bounds.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic bug, Out‐of‐bounds access.  
Bug Reason: The logic assumes `id[i]` and `alias_id[i]` are valid during the error reporting phase, but `i` can have a value of `num_id` in the `err` section, leading to out-of-bounds array access. This violates the assumption that array access is limited to valid indices.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Update the `err` section to ensure the index `i` is decremented by one before accessing `id[i]` and `alias_id[i]` in reporting, or use a copy of the last valid index for logging purposes:
```c
if (i > 0) --i;
dev_err(dev, "Failed to create supply alias %s,%s -> %s,%s\n",
        id[i], dev_name(dev), alias_id[i], dev_name(alias_dev));
```
