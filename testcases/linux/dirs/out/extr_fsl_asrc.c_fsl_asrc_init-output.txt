### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function makes calls to `regmap_write` and `regmap_update_bits` without verifying the validity of the `asrc_priv->regmap` pointer beforehand. If `asrc_priv` is null or `asrc_priv->regmap` is invalid (e.g., a null pointer), this will result in undefined behavior due to dereferencing null or invalid memory location.  
Confidence: High  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: Asrc_priv is used to access `asrc_priv->regmap` multiple times without any null-check on the `asrc_priv` pointer or its fields. If `asrc_priv->regmap` is null, it could result in a null pointer dereference leading to a crash or unpredictable behavior. Additionally, `regmap_update_bits` and `regmap_write` may not behave correctly for invalid pointers, potentially leading to memory corruption or failure during register manipulation.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
A null-pointer check should be added for the `asrc_priv` and its `regmap` field before making any calls to `regmap_write`/`regmap_update_bits`. Example:

```c
if (!asrc_priv || !asrc_priv->regmap)
    return -EINVAL; // Return an appropriate error code.
```
Additionally, ensure that the `regmap` field is valid and properly initialized in the calling code to avoid dereferencing invalid pointers.
