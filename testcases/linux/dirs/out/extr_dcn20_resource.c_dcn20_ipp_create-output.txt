UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing `ipp_regs[inst]` without verifying if `inst` is within bounds causes undefined behavior if `inst` exceeds the bounds of the `ipp_regs` array.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the input `inst` to ensure it is within valid bounds for the `ipp_regs` array. This can result in memory corruption or crashes when accessing `ipp_regs[inst]`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate `inst` before using it as an index into the `ipp_regs` array. For example:

```c
if (inst >= ARRAY_SIZE(ipp_regs)) {
    BREAK_TO_DEBUGGER();
    return NULL;
}
```

This ensures the array access is safe and prevents undefined behavior.
