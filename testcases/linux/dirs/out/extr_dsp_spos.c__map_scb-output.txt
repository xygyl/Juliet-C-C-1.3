Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_dsp_spos.c__map_scb.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The use of `strcpy` without ensuring the destination buffer has sufficient capacity causes undefined behavior if `name` is longer than the buffer size allocated for `ins->scbs[index].scb_name`. Without information about the size of `scb_name`, buffer overflow and memory corruption are a risk.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The function performs a copy operation using `strcpy`, which does not check bounds. If `name` exceeds the size of `scb_name`, it will overflow the buffer and corrupt adjacent memory. This is a logic bug that may lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `strcpy` with `strncpy` and explicitly check the size of `name` against the size of `ins->scbs[index].scb_name`. Alternatively, use a safer, bounds-checked string copy function if available.
