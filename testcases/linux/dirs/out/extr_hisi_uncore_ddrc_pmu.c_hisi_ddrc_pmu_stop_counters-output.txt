UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not explicitly check for `ddrc_pmu` being `NULL` before dereferencing it. If `ddrc_pmu` is `NULL`, accessing `ddrc_pmu->base + DDRC_PERF_CTRL` would result in undefined behavior (null pointer dereference).  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: The lack of validation for the `ddrc_pmu` pointer before usage results in a potential null pointer dereference, causing program crashes or unexpected behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: 
Add a null pointer check at the beginning of the function to validate `ddrc_pmu` before dereferencing:  
```c
if (!ddrc_pmu) {
    return; // Or handle the error appropriately
}
```
