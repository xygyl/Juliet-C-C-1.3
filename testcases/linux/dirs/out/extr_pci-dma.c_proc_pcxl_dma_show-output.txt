Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pci-dma.c_proc_pcxl_dma_show.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential divide-by-zero undefined behavior exists in the expressions `(pcxl_used_bytes * 100) / pcxl_res_size` and `(pcxl_used_pages * 100 / total_pages)`. If `pcxl_res_size` or `total_pages` are zero, the code will perform a division by zero, which is undefined behavior in C.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: Divide-by-zero vulnerability exists for cases where `pcxl_res_size` or `total_pages` are zero. Additionally, certain values of `pcxl_res_size` and `total_pages` might make calculations logically incorrect or nonsensical in the context where sizes are zero or unavailable.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
Add a guard clause to check if `pcxl_res_size` and `total_pages` are zero before performing division operations. For example:
```c
if (pcxl_res_size == 0 || total_pages == 0) {
    seq_puts(m, "\nWarning: DMA resource size or total pages is zero.\n");
    return -EINVAL; // Return an error code or handle appropriately
}
```
