UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Division by zero possible in the calculations for `fir_hinc` and `fir_vinc`. If `out_width` or `out_height` is zero, dividing by zero will trigger undefined behavior as per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: No safeguards are present to check if `out_width` or `out_height` are zero. This leads to a runtime error if either value is zero and the computation for `fir_hinc` or `fir_vinc` occurs. This division by zero also corresponds to UB.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to ensure `out_width` and `out_height` are not zero before performing the division. For example:
```c
if (out_width == 0 || out_height == 0) {
    /* Handle error or provide alternate logic */
    return;
}
```
