Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dm-snap-transient.c_transient_status.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: In the case `STATUSTYPE_TABLE`, `DMEMIT` may dereference invalid pointers or cause an out-of-bounds memory write because `sz` is returned but not updated, and `DMEMIT` likely modifies `result` without bounds checking against `maxlen`. The behavior of writing beyond `maxlen` leads to undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer overflow  
Bug Reason: The `DMEMIT` macro potentially writes data to `result` without verifying that the buffer length (`maxlen`) is sufficient to hold the output, which can exhaust or overflow the buffer and cause memory corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before invoking `DMEMIT`, ensure `maxlen` is properly checked to guarantee that the output will not exceed the bounds of the `result` buffer. Track the size of the emitted data accurately by incrementing `sz` per buffer utilization.

Casting `store->chunk_size` and passing it as part of `DMEMIT` should also be verified as safe, considering that `store` itself must be valid. Also, consider explicitly updating `sz` within the `STATUSTYPE_TABLE` case to reflect the actual buffer space usage.
