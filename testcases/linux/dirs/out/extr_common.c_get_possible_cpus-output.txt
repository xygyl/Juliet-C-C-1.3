Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_common.c_get_possible_cpus.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Calling `strerror(-cpus)` with a negative value results in undefined behavior because the `strerror` function expects a valid error code (`errno` values), which are positive integers. The behavior of passing negative values is undefined.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: There is an improper use of the `strerror()` function, which could result in incorrect error messages or undefined behavior since negative values are not valid inputs for this function. Additionally, passing `-1` to `exit()` may confuse users because Unix exit codes are conventionally non-negative.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Ensure `cpus` is checked appropriately before passing `-cpus` to `strerror`. If `libbpf_num_possible_cpus()` returns a negative error code, the absolute value or proper mapping to an `errno` constant should be used.  
2. Use a positive, non-confusing value such as `1` or `EXIT_FAILURE` for the `exit()` argument:  

```c
if (cpus < 0) {  
    p_err("Can't get # of possible cpus: %s", strerror(abs(cpus)));  
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);  
}
```
