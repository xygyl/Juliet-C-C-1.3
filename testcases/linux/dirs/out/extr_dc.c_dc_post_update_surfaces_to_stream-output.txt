Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dc.c_dc_post_update_surfaces_to_stream.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences elements of `context->res_ctx.pipe_ctx` without verifying whether `context` is a valid pointer or whether its `res_ctx` or `pipe_ctx` fields are initialized properly. If `dc->current_state` (referenced as `context`) is `NULL`, the dereference `context->res_ctx.pipe_ctx` will invoke undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `dc->current_state` is `NULL`, dereferencing it to access `context->res_ctx.pipe_ctx` results in undefined behavior and a likely system crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to confirm `dc->current_state` is not `NULL`:
```c
if (dc->current_state == NULL)
    return false;
```
Additionally, reviewing whether `pipe_ctx` has been properly initialized or allocated would further safeguard this function. Clear documentation and contract requirements on `dc->current_state` would also help prevent misuse.
