UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `memcpy` call uses `sizeof(fg->mask.match_criteria)` for size, but `fg->mask.match_criteria` is declared as a pointer (`u32 *`). Using `sizeof` on a pointer results in the size of the pointer, not the data it points to. This could lead to undefined behavior if the size of the pointed data exceeds the size of the pointer.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The same issue described above applies to this scenario. The logic assumes that `sizeof(fg->mask.match_criteria)` will correctly represent the size of the data being copied, but that is incorrect unless the pointer is explicitly pointing to memory of known and fixed size, which is not validated here. The copying behavior might result in incomplete copying or unintended memory writes, leading to an inconsistent flow group configuration.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `sizeof(fg->mask.match_criteria)` with the correct size of the data being copied. If the actual size of the data pointed to by `fg->mask.match_criteria` is dynamic, additional mechanisms (such as a size field in the structure) should be employed to track its length. Alternatively, if `match_criteria` is supposed to point to a statically allocated array, ensure its declaration matches the expected fixed size and use that specific size.
