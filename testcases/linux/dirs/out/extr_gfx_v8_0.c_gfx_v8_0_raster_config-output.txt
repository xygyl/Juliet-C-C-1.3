### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is a potential null pointer dereference if either `rconf` or `rconf1` is passed as `NULL` when calling this function. Since the function writes directly to `*rconf` and `*rconf1`, any dereference of a null pointer results in undefined behavior. However, the function does not check whether `rconf` or `rconf1` are valid pointers before operating on them. Additionally, the `DRM_ERROR` macro may introduce undefined behavior if `adev->asic_type` is not a valid format for the macro.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate pointers `rconf` and `rconf1` and assumes they are valid. If either is `NULL` when passed to the function, it will cause a crash due to dereferencing the null pointer.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer checks at the beginning of the function to ensure `rconf` and `rconf1` are valid pointers. For example:
```c
if (!rconf || !rconf1) {
    DRM_ERROR("Invalid NULL pointer passed to gfx_v8_0_raster_config\n");
    return;
}
``` 

Additionally, ensure `adev->asic_type` holds a valid value for formatting in `DRM_ERROR`.
