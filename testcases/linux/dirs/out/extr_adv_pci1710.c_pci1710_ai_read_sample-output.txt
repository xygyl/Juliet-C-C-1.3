UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential for accessing an out-of-bounds element in `devpriv->act_chanlist` if `cur_chan` is larger than the size of the array. This causes undefined behavior due to an invalid memory access.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: The function blindly accesses `devpriv->act_chanlist[cur_chan]` without ensuring `cur_chan` is within the bounds of the array. This could lead to out-of-bounds memory access, resulting in a crash, unexpected behavior, or even security vulnerabilities.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate `cur_chan` before accessing `devpriv->act_chanlist[cur_chan]`. Ensure it does not exceed the bounds of the array. For example:  

```c
if (cur_chan >= ARRAY_SIZE(devpriv->act_chanlist)) {
    dev_err(dev->class_dev, "Invalid channel index %d\n", cur_chan);
    return -ENODATA;
}
```

This ensures `cur_chan` is within the valid range and prevents undefined behavior and bugs from occurring.
