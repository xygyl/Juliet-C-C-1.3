UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not check whether the `prio_tc` pointer is `NULL`. If `prio_tc` is `NULL` and the function attempts to dereference it (`prio_tc[i]`), undefined behavior will occur.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If `prio_tc` is `NULL`, attempting to access `prio_tc[i]` will cause a null pointer dereference, leading to a runtime crash or other unexpected behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to validate that `prio_tc` is not `NULL`. For example:
```c
if (prio_tc == NULL)
    return false;
```
