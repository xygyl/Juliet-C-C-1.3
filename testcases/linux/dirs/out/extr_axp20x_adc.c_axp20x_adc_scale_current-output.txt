### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Attempting to dereference or write to `*val` and `*val2` without verifying that they are valid pointers. If either `val` or `val2` is a null pointer or an invalid memory address, this results in undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not verify the validity of the pointers `val` and `val2` provided as arguments before dereferencing them. If the caller passes a null or invalid pointer, this can cause a crash or memory corruption. Additionally, `-EINVAL` being returned for invalid channels is correct, but the handling of pointers does not guard against potential misuse.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  
Rationale: The lack of pointer validity checks affects all code paths that attempt to dereference `val` and `val2`. This is a straightforward case of a potential null pointer dereference if invalid pointers are passed.  

### Fix Suggestion:
Add a check to ensure `val` and `val2` are not null at the beginning of the function:  
```c
if (!val || !val2) {
    return -EINVAL; // Or a more descriptive error code
}
```
This ensures that the function will fail gracefully if invalid pointers are passed, preventing undefined behavior and potential crashes.
