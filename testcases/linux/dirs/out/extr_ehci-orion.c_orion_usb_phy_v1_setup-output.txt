### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function primarily interfaces with registers via read (`rdl`) and write (`wrl`) operations. There are no operations involving uninitialized variables, null pointer dereferences, invalid memory accesses, or signed integer overflows. The function also follows appropriate synchronization patterns while toggling the USB controller reset (e.g., awaiting a clear `USB_CMD_RESET` via polling).

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function description comments note that `GL# USB-5 Streaming disable REG_USB_MODE[4]=1` must be applied *after each reset*, yet this is implemented only once after the second controller reset. If the controller is reset again later by another function (not visible here), this field may not remain configured properly, potentially leading to incorrect behavior.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `USB_MODE_SDIS | USB_MODE_HOST` configuration (`wrl(USB_MODE, USB_MODE_SDIS | USB_MODE_HOST)`) is applied after every instance of reset or explicitly state why subsequent resets are unnecessary for proper functioning.
