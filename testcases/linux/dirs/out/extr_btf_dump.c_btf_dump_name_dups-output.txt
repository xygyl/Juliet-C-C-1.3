### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code casts `dup_cnt` (a `size_t`) to `(void *)` in the call to `hashmap__set`. This violates the aliasing rules and strict type checking of C, given that `size_t` is an arithmetic type, and converting it directly to a pointer type introduces undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: Storing an integer (`dup_cnt`) as a pointer (`void *`) within the hashmap risks undefined/dysfunctional behavior because different platforms may have differing pointer sizes and alignment requirements. Furthermore, retrieving values from the hashmap later using `hashmap__find` relies on casting back `(void **)`, which can introduce further flaws if the conversion is not handled correctly. This approach should instead use an explicit wrapper type or consistent abstract mechanism for storing integers in the hashmap.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Use a wrapper structure to ensure type safety, e.g.:  
```c
struct hashmap_entry {
    size_t dup_cnt;
};

// Update hashmap__set and hashmap__find accordingly to handle the `struct hashmap_entry` type consistently.  
hashmap__find(name_map, orig_name, (void **)&entry);  
entry->dup_cnt++;
hashmap__set(name_map, orig_name, &entry, NULL, NULL);
```  

Alternatively, avoid casting integers to void pointers directlyâ€”store pointers to allocated integers when working with the hashmap to ensure there is no violation of strict aliasing rules.
