UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code does not validate that `tbl->cfg` and `tbl->count` correspond to valid entries that prevent out-of-bounds memory access in the loop. If `tbl->cfg` is a null pointer or `tbl->count` is zero, dereferencing `tbl->cfg[i]` leads to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw, potential out-of-bounds access.
Bug Reason: If `tbl->cfg` is null or if `tbl->count` is greater than the actual valid size of the `cfg` array, the loop that accesses `tbl->cfg[i]` can result in an out-of-bounds memory access or segmentation fault.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add validation checks to ensure `tbl` is not null and that `tbl->count` is within the bounds of the allocated array size for `tbl->cfg`. For example:
```c
if (!tbl || !tbl->cfg || tbl->count == 0)
	return;
```
