Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_platsmp.c_alpine_boot_secondary.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The cast `(uint32_t)addr` causes truncation of `addr` if its value exceeds the limits of a 32-bit unsigned integer. This leads to undefined behavior in contexts where the truncated address is used to access memory, as it could point to invalid memory addresses or change program logic.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The truncation of `addr` to 32-bit could result in an incorrect memory address being passed to `alpine_cpu_wakeup()`. This may lead to incorrect operation or a crash if the processed memory location is invalid or unintended.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a proper check on whether `addr` exceeds the range of a 32-bit unsigned value, before casting it. Alternatively, ensure that all code paths handling `addr` support 64-bit addresses without truncation.  

Updated code snippet: 
```c
static int alpine_boot_secondary(unsigned int cpu, struct task_struct *idle)
{
    phys_addr_t addr;

    addr = __pa_symbol(secondary_startup);

    if (addr > (phys_addr_t)(uint32_t)(-1)) {
        pr_err("FAIL: resume address over 32bit (%pa)", &addr);
        return -EINVAL;
    }

    // Ensure type compatibility with alpine_cpu_wakeup
    uint32_t truncated_addr = (uint32_t)addr;

    if (addr != (phys_addr_t)truncated_addr) {
        pr_err("FAIL: 64-bit address truncated incorrectly (%pa)", &addr);
        return -EINVAL;
    }

    return alpine_cpu_wakeup(cpu_logical_map(cpu), truncated_addr);
}
```  

Explanation: By ensuring that the truncated address matches its original value, you avoid invalid usage of truncated or out-of-range addresses, mitigating undefined behavior and logic bugs.
