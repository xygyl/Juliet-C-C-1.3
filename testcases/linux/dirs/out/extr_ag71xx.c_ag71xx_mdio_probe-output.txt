Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_ag71xx.c_ag71xx_mdio_probe.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: 
1. **Static local variable usage**: The static variable `mii_bus` defined within the function is not thread-safe, and if this function is called concurrently across threads, it will result in undefined behavior due to unintended data sharing/modification.
2. **Crossing initialization boundaries with IS_ERR checks**: The function uses `IS_ERR` macros after varying initialization states (`ag->clk_mdio` and `ag->mdio_reset`). While this is usually safe, if the macro is misused or the allocation changes state in parallel, UB may arise since no synchronization is enforced.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic bug (incorrect handling of reset assertion/deassertion sequence)
Bug Reason: 
The function does not correctly handle error paths when operations like `reset_control_assert` or `reset_control_deassert` fail. If `reset_control_assert` fails, the function proceeds with `reset_control_deassert` regardless, possibly leading to inconsistent hardware state. Additionally, crossing secondary edge lbl+ thread recursion/handling beyond probable).

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium

Fix Suggestion: 
1. Remove the `static` qualifier from `mii_bus` and initialize it dynamically in the function, ensuring no data races occur in multi-threaded environments.
2. Tighten error handling for reset controls â€“ check their successful invocation with proper error checking, and bail out if failures are detected.
