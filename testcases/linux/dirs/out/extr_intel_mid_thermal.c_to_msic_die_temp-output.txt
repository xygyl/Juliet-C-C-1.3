UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function performs an arithmetic operation (`368 * adc_val / 1000 - 220`) using an integer type (`uint16_t` for `adc_val`). This operation does not trigger undefined behavior as long as the intermediate values do not exceed the range of the types involved. The division and multiplication are safe as the input `adc_val` is unsigned and `1000` is a literal constant. Also, there are no pointer operations, uninitialized variables, or other potential sources of UB encountered.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason: `uint16_t` is a 16-bit unsigned integer type, meaning that its maximum value is `65535`. The multiplication `368 * adc_val` could potentially overflow since `368 * 65535 = 24,092,880`. An overflow in this calculation would result in truncation, leading to an incorrect computation.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Switch `adc_val` and intermediate computations to a larger integer type, such as `uint32_t` or `unsigned long`, to prevent overflow. Modify the function as follows:  

```c
static int to_msic_die_temp(uint16_t adc_val)  
{  
    return (368UL * adc_val / 1000) - 220;  
}
```  

This ensures that the multiplication result is computed using a larger type (`unsigned long`), avoiding overflow.
