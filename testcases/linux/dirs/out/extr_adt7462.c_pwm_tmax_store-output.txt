Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_adt7462.c_pwm_tmax_store.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow may occur in the expression `tmin = (data->pwm_tmin[attr->index] - 64) * 1000`. If `data->pwm_tmin[attr->index] - 64` is large enough when cast to a signed integer, multiplying by `1000` may exceed the range of `int`. Signed integer overflow leads to undefined behavior as per the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer overflow  
Bug Reason: The operation `tmin = (data->pwm_tmin[attr->index] - 64) * 1000` can cause an overflow in a signed integer because the product can exceed the maximum representable value of an `int`. This would result in incorrect logic for calculating `trange_value`, potentially leading to unexpected program behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `data->pwm_tmin[attr->index] - 64` is safely cast to a larger integer type, such as `long long` or `int64_t`, before multiplying with `1000`. Alternatively, document guaranteed ranges for `data->pwm_tmin` values to assert no overflow can occur.
