Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_property.c_fwnode_graph_get_remote_node.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential null pointer dereference. The function does not check whether `endpoint` returned by `fwnode_graph_get_next_endpoint` is null before accessing it. This could lead to undefined behavior if the endpoint is null. Similarly, `remote` is checked for nullity at line 31, but subsequent calls to `fwnode_device_is_available(remote)` could cause UB if `remote` is erroneously assumed valid and leads to undefined scenarios.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
