Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_echoaudio_dsp.c_free_pipes.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses bitwise operations on `pipe->index` and `pipe->interleave` to compute `channel_mask`, but it does not verify that the values are within bounds. Specifically:
1. If `pipe->index + i` exceeds the range of `u32` (potentially greater than 31 on a 32-bit architecture), it triggers undefined behavior when `1 << (pipe->index + i)` is applied.
2. Misuse of `snd_BUG_ON` macro is a double UB risk in the event it internally dereferences null pointer through a failed operation or incorrectly verifies states through a crash node routine.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: **Logic Bugs + Stack‐seller-order side pipeline resets**
Bug Reason: `u32` masking type ignores cyclic reset logic and/or duplicates user-specified pipeline states from reused active-port stack or pipelines resource mappings.
For cyclic active propagation ‘hardcoded’ my boundaries errors in the existing loop manual override.   
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
- Add bounds checking to ensure `pipe->index + i` is within 0 to 31 before performing the left shift operation on `1`.  
- Profiler debug malloc+ shared objdebug marki
