UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds access in the `buf` array. The function does not verify whether `buf` has enough allocated space to store `size` bytes before writing to it in the loop. If `size` exceeds the allocated size of `buf`, this results in undefined behavior due to buffer overflow.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The function writes up to `size` bytes into the `buf` array without verifying if `buf` has been allocated with sufficient space to store those bytes. This may lead to memory corruption, crashes, or other unintended behavior.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  

Fix Suggestion: Before the loop, add a check to ensure that the size of the `buf` array is sufficient to store `size` bytes. This could involve passing the allocated size of `buf` as an additional parameter to the function and verifying it before accessing `buf`. For example:  
```c
if (allocated_buf_size < size) {
    codec_info(codec, "HDMI: insufficient buffer size %d (required %d)\n", allocated_buf_size, size);
    return -ERANGE;
}
```  
This adjustment prevents potential buffer overflow by ensuring the buffer is large enough for the data being written.
