UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The line `data = table[pdev->id];` potentially dereferences an invalid index in the `table` array. Specifically, `pdev->id` is used as the index, but there is no explicit validation that `pdev->id` is within bounds of the `table` array. Accessing an out-of-bounds array element results in undefined behavior according to the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: In the case where `pdev->id` exceeds the bounds of the `table` array, an out-of-bounds array access occurs, which can lead to incorrect behavior or memory corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add proper validation for `pdev->id` to ensure it is less than the size of the `table` array before accessing the array. For example:  
```c
if (pdev->id >= table_size) // table_size should be determined appropriately  
    return -ENODEV;  
```
