Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nct6775.c_store_pwm_enable.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function contains potential undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access. The line `data->pwm[0][nr] = 255;` assumes that `nr` is a valid index. However, the function does not validate the bounds of `nr` against the dimensions of the `pwm` or `pwm_enable` arrays. If `nr` is larger than the size of either array or negative, this will lead to undefined behavior via out-of-bounds access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: The array access `data->pwm[0][nr]` and the indirect use of `data->REG_PWM[0][nr]` lack validation for the `nr` index. If `nr` is invalid, this may corrupt memory or lead to a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate `nr` before using it as an index. Add a condition like `if (nr < 0 || nr >= MAX_INDEX) return -EINVAL;` where `MAX_INDEX` reflects the maximum allowed index for the arrays in `data`.
