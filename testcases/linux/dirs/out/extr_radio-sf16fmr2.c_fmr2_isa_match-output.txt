Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_radio-sf16fmr2.c_fmr2_isa_match.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing and incrementing `num_fmr2_cards` may cause undefined behavior if the value exceeds the bounds of the `fmr2_cards` array. It is unclear if `fmr2_cards` has been pre-allocated with a sufficient size to hold the number of cards.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Array Out-of-Bounds Access
Bug Reason: If `num_fmr2_cards` is incremented without checking whether it exceeds the size limit of the `fmr2_cards` array, this could lead to buffer overflow or corruption of memory beyond the allocated array.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check to ensure that `num_fmr2_cards` does not exceed the size of the `fmr2_cards` array. For example:
```c
if (num_fmr2_cards >= MAX_FMR2_CARDS) {
    return 0; // Or some other error handling code
}
fmr2_cards[num_fmr2_cards++] = fmr2;
```
Ensure `MAX_FMR2_CARDS` is defined appropriately based on the size of the `fmr2_cards` array.
