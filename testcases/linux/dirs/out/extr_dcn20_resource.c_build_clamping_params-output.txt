UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function operates within well-defined constraints. It assumes that the `stream` pointer is valid, but there is no evidence in the given code that the pointer could be null or uninitialized directly within the function. All assignments are safe and do not rely on undefined behavior such as buffer overflows, invalid dereferences, or signed integer overflows.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not explicitly check if `stream` is null before dereferencing it. If `stream` were to be unintentionally null by the caller, dereferencing its members would result in undefined behavior and likely cause a crash (segmentation fault).
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check at the beginning of the function to ensure `stream` is valid before proceeding with memory accesses. For example:
```c
if (stream == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
This ensures safe operation regardless of the caller's input.
