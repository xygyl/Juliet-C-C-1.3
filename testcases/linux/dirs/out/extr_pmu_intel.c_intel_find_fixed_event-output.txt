### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses `fixed_pmc_events[idx]` without explicitly verifying that the value of `idx` corresponds to a valid index in the `fixed_pmc_events` array. Although `idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(fixed_pmc_events)` is checked, this does not guarantee against potential issues such as invalid or corrupted values in the `fixed_pmc_events` array. Accessing an out-of-bounds index could occur due to corruption or under certain edge cases, leading to undefined behavior. Static analysis tools would flag this particular code fragment for potential invalid memory access without assuming external guarantees of data integrity (e.g., that assigned values in `fixed_pmc_events` align with `intel_arch_events` array size).

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The code assumes that the index provided via `fixed_pmc_events[idx]` will always refer to a valid entry in the `intel_arch_events` array. However, there is no explicit validation to ensure `fixed_pmc_events[idx]` itself lies within the bounds of the `intel_arch_events` array. If the value of `fixed_pmc_events[idx]` exceeds the bounds of `intel_arch_events`, it results in an out-of-bounds access, which is a bug that may lead to crashes or incorrect data.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
Add explicit bounds-checking for `fixed_pmc_events[idx]` before accessing `intel_arch_events`. For example:
```c
if (idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(fixed_pmc_events) || fixed_pmc_events[idx] >= ARRAY_SIZE(intel_arch_events))
    return PERF_COUNT_HW_MAX;

return intel_arch_events[fixed_pmc_events[idx]].event_type;
```
This ensures both `idx` and `fixed_pmc_events[idx]` are validated before use, eliminating undefined behavior and logic flaws.
