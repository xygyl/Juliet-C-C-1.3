UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `pi` is `NULL`, dereferencing it (`pi->pubpi.phy_rev`, `pi->radio_chanspec`, etc.) causes undefined behavior. The function does not check if `pi` is `NULL` before accessing its fields.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `pi` is valid, but there's no guarantee from the provided code. If `pi` happens to be `NULL` during execution, dereferencing it will cause a crash or undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a `NULL` check for the input pointer `pi` at the beginning of the function to ensure it is not `NULL` before accessing its fields. Example:  
```c
if (pi == NULL) {
    return; // Or handle the error appropriately
}
```
