UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Out-of-bounds memory access could occur in the `memmove` function if `rm->rm_used` is zero or if `i` is equal to `rm->rm_used - 1`. Accessing `rm_entries[i + 1]` in these cases would result in dereferencing an invalid or unallocated memory address.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw, potential out-of-bounds memory read.
Bug Reason: `memmove` is called without proper validation to ensure `i + 1` is within bounds. If `rm_used` equals zero or `i` points to the last valid entry, `(rm_used - i - 1)` in `memmove` would be a negative value or incorrect calculation, causing undefined behavior or memory corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check before calling `memmove` to ensure `(rm_used - i - 1)` is non-negative and valid. Example:

```c
if (i < rm->rm_used - 1) {
    memmove(&(rm->rm_entries[i]), &(rm->rm_entries[i + 1]),
            (rm->rm_used - i - 1) * sizeof(unsigned int));
}
```

This ensures that the `memmove` operates within the bounds of the array and avoids reading or modifying out-of-bounds memory.
