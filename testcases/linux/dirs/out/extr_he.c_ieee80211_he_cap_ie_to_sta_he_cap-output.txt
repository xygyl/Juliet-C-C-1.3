UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: 
1. **Potential Out-of-Bounds Memory Access**: The calculation of `he_total_size` and its use in the comparison `if (he_cap_len < he_total_size)` doesn't ensure that the indexing during `he_ppe_size` calculation remains within bounds. Specifically, the line:
   ```
   ieee80211_he_ppe_size(he_cap_ie[sizeof(he_cap->he_cap_elem) + mcs_nss_size], he_cap_ie_elem->phy_cap_info);
   ```
   may index out of the bounds of `he_cap_ie` if `he_cap_len` is less than `sizeof(he_cap->he_cap_elem) + mcs_nss_size`.
2. **Dereferencing a Null Pointer**: The pointer `he_cap_ie_elem` is implicitly cast from `he_cap_ie`. If `he_cap_ie == NULL`, dereferencing it through `he_cap_ie_elem->phy_cap_info` leads to undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Memory Access, Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: 
1. Similar reasoning to the UB - the handling of `he_cap_ie` assumes it's valid for all memory accesses, but conditions prior to these accesses don't guarantee that. For example:
   ```
   ieee80211_he_ppe_size(he_cap_ie[sizeof(he_cap->he_cap_elem) + mcs_nss_size], he_cap_ie_elem->phy_cap_info);
   ```
   This can access memory beyond `he_cap_ie` if it isn't properly bounded.
2. If `he_cap_ie` is `NULL`, any dereferencing (like `he_cap_ie_elem->phy_cap_info`) results in a bug.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
- Before accessing `he_cap_ie`, add a length check for `he_cap_len` that ensures safe memory access. Specifically, verify `he_cap_len >= sizeof(he_cap->he_cap_elem) + mcs_nss_size`.
- Check explicitly for `he_cap_ie == NULL` at the start of the function to avoid null pointer dereferences.
- Refactor condition checks and assignments to ensure bounds are consistent across all memory accesses involving `he_cap_ie`. Example:
  ```c
  if (!he_cap_ie || he_cap_len < sizeof(he_cap->he_cap_elem)) {
      return;
  }
  ```
