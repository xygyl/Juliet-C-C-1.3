UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The division `n / d` and modulo operation `n % d` could result in undefined behavior if `d` is zero. While there is a check (`if (!n || !d)`) at the beginning of the function, this does not prevent undefined behavior if `d` is manipulated or indirectly modified before being used later in the code (not visible in inline function alone). Without surrounding context, we must assume `d == 0` could occur directly or indirectly.
 
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The `min(15U, n / d + (n % d >= (fps >> 1)))` calculation assumes that `(fps >> 1)` is a valid operation. If `fps` equals 0, `fps >> 1` results in a value of 0, so `(n % d >= (fps >> 1))` becomes meaningless and introduces inconsistencies. Additionally,x "defer computation region fallback, reviewers-favor sucrdivision of future .

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit validation checks for both `fps` and `d` before performing operations like `(fps >> 1)` and `n / d`. If `fps` or `d` is zero, the function should handle it gracefully, for example by returning an appropriate default value. Modify the logic to clarify handling zero values.
