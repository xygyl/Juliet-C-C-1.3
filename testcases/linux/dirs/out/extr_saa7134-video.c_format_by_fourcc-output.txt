Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_saa7134-video.c_format_by_fourcc.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code accesses the `formats` array without validating whether `FORMATS` correctly represents the size of the `formats` array. If `FORMATS` is larger than the actual size of the array, this results in out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: `FORMATS` is used as the loop boundary without validating whether it matches the allocated size of the `formats` array. If the `formats` array is smaller than `FORMATS`, the code will read invalid memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `FORMATS` correctly reflects the size of the `formats` array, possibly by explicitly defining its size directly in the declaration of the array or dynamically determining the size. Alternatively, use a safer approach, such as encapsulating the format array with a proper size variable.
