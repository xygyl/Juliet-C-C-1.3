UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences the `crtc` pointer (`crtc->channel`) without checking if it is null, which can lead to undefined behavior if `crtc` is passed as a null pointer. Additionally, the type `ushort` is used without ensuring it matches the expected size across platforms, potentially leading to incorrect behavior depending on data type sizes.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes the `crtc` pointer is valid without verifying. If a null pointer or an invalid pointer is passed to this function, it may result in a crash or unpredictable behavior due to dereferencing.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check at the start of the function to ensure `crtc` is valid before dereferencing:
```c
if (crtc == NULL) {
    return -1; // or another appropriate error code
}
```
Additionally, ensure that `ushort` has a consistent definition across platforms or replace it with a more standard fixed-width integer type, such as `uint16_t`.
