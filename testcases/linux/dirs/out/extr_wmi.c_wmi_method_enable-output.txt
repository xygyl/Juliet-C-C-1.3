Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_wmi.c_wmi_method_enable.c

UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit any behavior that qualifies as undefined per the C standard. All pointers, variables, and operations appear properly initialized and valid for their types. Operations like `snprintf` and pointer accesses are used safely within bounds.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function returns `AE_OK` for both cases where `acpi_execute_simple_method()` returns `AE_OK` and `AE_NOT_FOUND`. This makes it impossible for the caller to distinguish between a successful execution (`AE_OK`) and a condition where the method wasn't found (`AE_NOT_FOUND`). This is likely incorrect since both statuses have distinct meanings and should be properly conveyed to the caller.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Modify the return logic. Instead of collapsing `AE_OK` and `AE_NOT_FOUND` into a single return value (`AE_OK`), return `status` directly so that the caller can distinguish between the two. Example:
```c
return status;
```
