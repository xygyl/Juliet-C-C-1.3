Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nouveau_connector.c_nouveau_connector_destroy.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function may invoke undefined behavior due to double-free issues. It calls `kfree(connector)` and later dereferences the `connector` (via `nouveau_connector(connector)`) indirectly, which assumes `connector` is valid after being freed.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Double-free
Bug Reason: The `kfree(connector)` call happens prematurely before all uses of `connector` are completed. Dereferencing it or passing it to functions after freeing it can lead to undefined behavior or a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Remove the `kfree(connector)` call at the end of the function, or ensure all uses of `connector` are complete before calling `kfree`. Alternatively, reorder the code flow to avoid potential reuse of the freed memory.
