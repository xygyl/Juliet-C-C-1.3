UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is potential undefined behavior due to accessing memory with `sg_copy_to_buffer()` and `sg_copy_from_buffer()` without verifying that `req->dst` contains enough allocated space to handle the full size of `ctx->key_size`. This could cause an out-of-bounds memory access if the destination scatterlist does not have adequate space, violating the standard memory safety rules. Additionally, `kzfree(out_buf)` is used unnecessarily in this context, as `out_buf` was allocated with `kzalloc` and does not contain sensitive data requiring zeroing on free.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential out-of-bounds memory access  
Bug Reason: The lack of checks for the validity and capacity of `req->dst` before invoking `sg_copy_to_buffer()` and `sg_copy_from_buffer()` can result in overwriting unintended memory regions. This suggests an improper handling of scatterlist buffer sizes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Verify the size and validity of `req->dst` before performing scatterlist operations to ensure that `req->dst` can accommodate `ctx->key_size`. Remove the unnecessary `kzfree(out_buf)` as it serves no security purpose here. Consider adding debug or runtime checks to guard against scatterlist mismanagement.
