Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_adreno_common.xml.h_AXXX_CP_QUEUE_THRESHOLDS_CSQ_IB2_START.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Shift operation may cause undefined behavior if `val` is large enough to exceed the width of `uint32_t` (e.g., `AXXX_CP_QUEUE_THRESHOLDS_CSQ_IB2_START__SHIFT` >= 32). According to the C standard, shifting a value by more than or equal to the width of the type leads to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: None
Bug Reason: No logic or memory-related bugs were identified in this inline function since its behavior aligns with bit-masking operations that are valid if the shift amount (`AXXX_CP_QUEUE_THRESHOLDS_CSQ_IB2_START__SHIFT`) is within the valid range.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `AXXX_CP_QUEUE_THRESHOLDS_CSQ_IB2_START__SHIFT` is within the range `[0, 31]` to prevent the shift operation from exceeding 32 bits:
```c
#include <assert.h>
assert(AXXX_CP_QUEUE_THRESHOLDS_CSQ_IB2_START__SHIFT < 32);
return ((val) << AXXX_CP_QUEUE_THRESHOLDS_CSQ_IB2_START__SHIFT) & AXXX_CP_QUEUE_THRESHOLDS_CSQ_IB2_START__MASK;
```
