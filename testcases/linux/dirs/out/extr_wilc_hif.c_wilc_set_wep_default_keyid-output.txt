UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: `sizeof(char)` is used incorrectly for determining the size of the `index` variable, which is of type `u8`. Since `u8` is most likely an alias for `unsigned char` (commonly used in Linux kernel code), the use of `sizeof(char)` may technically work, but it assumes that `u8` is equivalent to `char`. If `u8` were ever defined differently (e.g., as a typedef to another data type), this could result in undefined behavior or incorrect memory operations. The C standard treats `char` and any other possibly-sized integer types differently.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: `sizeof(char)` is used instead of `sizeof(u8)` or `sizeof(index)`. This may lead to incorrect results if the underlying type of `u8` changes or differs from `char`. While it might work correctly in most cases due to the typical equivalence of `u8` to `unsigned char`, this is fragile and could lead to inconsistencies if modified in the future.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Replace `sizeof(char)` with `sizeof(index)` in the line `wid.size = sizeof(char);`. This ensures the code works regardless of the underlying type of `u8`.
