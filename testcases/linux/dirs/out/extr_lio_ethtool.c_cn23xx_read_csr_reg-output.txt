UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The outermost loop (`for (i = 0; i < CN23XX_MAX_OUTPUT_QUEUES; i++)`) nests inner loops with conflicting reuse of the loop variable `i`, leading to potential undefined behavior in how iterations are performed. Inner loop overwrites `i` while the outer loop is still active, corrupting the logic flow.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: Reuse of the same loop variable `i` for nested loops can lead to invalid results: the inner loops modify `i`, disrupting the outer loop's control flow and causing incorrect iteration or potential infinite loop.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use distinct loop variables for each nested loop to avoid conflicts. For example, replace `i` in inner loops with a different variable like `j` or `k`.
