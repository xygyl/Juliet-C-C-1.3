Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_apparmorfs.c_seq_profile_attach_show.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Use of `profile->base.name` directly without checking for possible null dereference violates a safety assumption, as there is no guarantee that `profile->base.name` is non-null prior to access.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The `profile` structure obtained from `labels_profile(label)` has its fields accessed directly without ensuring they are valid. If `profile->base.name` is null, a null pointer dereference will occur in `seq_printf(seq, "%s\n", profile->base.name);`.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
- Add a null check before accessing `profile->base.name`:
```c
if (profile->base.name)
    seq_printf(seq, "%s\n", profile->base.name);
else
    seq_puts(seq, "<null>\n");
```
This ensures safe access to the field and avoids undefined behavior or runtime crashes.
