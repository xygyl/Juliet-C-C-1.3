Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_perf_event.c_alpha_pmu_stop.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function contains an attempt to shift a value left using `(1UL << hwc->idx)`, where `hwc->idx` is an `unsigned long`. If `hwc->idx` exceeds the number of bits in `unsigned long` (e.g., 64 on typical platforms), this causes undefined behavior as left-shifting beyond the type's width is undefined according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: If `hwc->idx` is out of bounds (greater than the number of bits in `unsigned long`), the bit mask logic `cpuc->idx_mask &= ~(1UL << hwc->idx)` and `wrperfmon(PERFMON_CMD_DISABLE, (1UL << hwc->idx))` will behave incorrectly, leading to unpredictable results. Additionally, if `idx` is unvalidated, it may result in corrupt or unintended memory state in the bitmask or hardware operation.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a range check for `hwc->idx` to ensure it is within valid boundaries (e.g., `hwc->idx < sizeof(unsigned long) * 8` or platform-specific limits) before performing the shift operations:

```c
if (hwc->idx < sizeof(unsigned long) * 8) {
    cpuc->idx_mask &= ~(1UL << hwc->idx);
    wrperfmon(PERFMON_CMD_DISABLE, (1UL << hwc->idx));
} else {
    // Handle invalid index case, e.g., report an error or log a warning
}
```
