UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing `session->skcb.addr.type` without verifying that `session` is a valid non-null pointer leads to undefined behavior. If the `session` pointer is `NULL`, dereferencing it will cause undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: There is no explicit check in the function to verify that `session` is a valid pointer before accessing its members. If `session` is `NULL`, the function will crash when trying to dereference it.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `session` at the beginning of the function:

```c
if (!session)
    return NULL;
```
This will prevent the undefined behavior and potential null pointer dereference.
