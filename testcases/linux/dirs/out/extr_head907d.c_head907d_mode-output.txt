UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential for signed integer overflow in the multiplication `m->clock * 1000`, if `m->clock` is large enough to exceed the bounds of a signed integer representation. Signed overflow is undefined behavior under the C standard.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Signed Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason: Signed integer overflow in `m->clock * 1000` could cause incorrect results and potential memory corruption or program instability depending on how the value is used later.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Use an appropriate unsigned integer type for `m->clock` or cast the multiplication result to a larger unsigned type to prevent overflow. For instance:  
```c  
evo_data(push, (unsigned long long)m->clock * 1000);
```
