UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing the `event - 0x83` index of the `dup_evnt` array without checking bounds leads to undefined behavior if `event` has a value outside the range `[0x83, 0x84]`. This occurs because array indexing in C is undefined behavior when the index is out of bounds.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw and Potential Out-of-Bounds Access
Bug Reason: The function uses a static array `dup_evnt[2]` and calculates the index as `event - 0x83` without verifying that `event` is within the correct range. If an unexpected event value is provided (outside the range `[0x83, 0x84]`), it can cause out-of-bounds access on the array, leading to memory corruption or undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: 
- Add explicit bounds checking to ensure `event` is within the range `[0x83, 0x84]` before accessing the `dup_evnt` array.
- Example fix:
```c
if (event == 0x83 || event == 0x84) {
    int index = event - 0x83;
    if (index >= 0 && index < 2) { // Ensure array bounds are respected
        dup = &dup_evnt[index];
        if (*dup) {
            *dup = false;
            return;
        }
        *dup = true;
    }
}
```
This check guarantees safe access to the array, mitigating undefined behavior and the possibility of bugs.
