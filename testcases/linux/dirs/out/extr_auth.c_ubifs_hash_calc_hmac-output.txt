### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. The code uses `SHASH_DESC_ON_STACK`, which creates a structure `shash` on the stack with `shash->tfm` initialized to `c->hmac_tfm`. However, if the `c` pointer is null, dereferencing `c->hmac_tfm` will result in undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference. There is no null pointer check for `c` in the function.  
2. Additionally, the value of `c->hash_len` is used without validation. If it holds an invalid or excessively large value, this could lead to out-of-bounds memory access during the call to `crypto_shash_digest`.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference, potential out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason:  
1. The function assumes `c` is a valid pointer, but there are no checks to ensure this. If `c` is null, the access to `c->hmac_tfm` and `c->hash_len` will result in runtime errors or crashes.  
2. The value of `c->hash_len` is passed to `crypto_shash_digest` without any bounds checking. If it is unreasonably large or negative (depending on the higher-level type constraints), it could lead to unintended behavior or memory corruption.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Add a null pointer check for `c` at the beginning of the function:
   ```c
   if (!c) {
       return -EINVAL; // Return an appropriate error code
   }
   ```
2. Validate `c->hash_len` to ensure it is within acceptable bounds before passing it to `crypto_shash_digest`. Example:
   ```c
   if (c->hash_len <= 0 || c->hash_len > MAX_HASH_LEN) { // Define MAX_HASH_LEN appropriately
       return -EINVAL; // Return an appropriate error code
   }
   ```
