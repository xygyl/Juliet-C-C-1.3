UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: 
The `ARRAY_SIZE` macro is used with `void*` type variables (`mt6797_memif_dai_driver`, `mt6797_memif_widgets`, and `mt6797_memif_routes`). The behavior is undefined because the size of `void*` is not meaningful in this context, and the macro is typically intended for use with array types. Applying `sizeof` on a pointer does not yield the size of the referenced array, leading to incorrect calculations and undefined behavior if the macro depends on accurate sizes.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw/Broken Functionality
Bug Reason: 
Using `ARRAY_SIZE` with `void*` incorrectly assumes that the variables (`mt6797_memif_dai_driver`, `mt6797_memif_widgets`, and `mt6797_memif_routes`) are arrays. If these variables are merely pointers to dynamically allocated memory or other non-array constructs, the resulting `num_*` fields in the `mtk_base_afe_dai` structure will be wrong, which may break later operations such as iterating or indexing. This logic flaw could manifest as runtime issues like crashes or incorrect behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion:
1. Verify the type of `mt6797_memif_dai_driver`, `mt6797_memif_widgets`, and `mt6797_memif_routes`. If they are arrays, ensure the macro `ARRAY_SIZE` works correctly with them; if they are pointers, compute their lengths appropriately using external metadata or allocate and initialize them with a known size.
2. Replace `ARRAY_SIZE` for proper size computation or refactor usage as necessary.
