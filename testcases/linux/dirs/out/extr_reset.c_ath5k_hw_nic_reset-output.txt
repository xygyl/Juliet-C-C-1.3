UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential for signed integer overflow in the `usleep_range(15, 20)` function if improperly handled; also, `~0U` used in masking operations relies on unsigned integer behaviorâ€”while technically not undefined in this usage, it could lead to issues under strict type interpretation. The code alters runtime regularely similarly threads.
Bug Detected: Medium-high. ---
