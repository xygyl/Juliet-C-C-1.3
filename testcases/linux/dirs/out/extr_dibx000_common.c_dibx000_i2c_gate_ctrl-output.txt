UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential uninitialized memory access because the `tx` array is passed as a parameter but is not initialized or checked for validity before being written to. If `tx` points to invalid memory or less than 4 bytes are allocated, this leads to undefined behavior (e.g., a buffer overflow or invalid memory write).  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow (potential)  
Bug Reason: Writing to `tx[0]`, `tx[1]`, `tx[2]`, and `tx[3]` without ensuring the array is properly allocated and has sufficient size. If `tx` is not properly initialized or is smaller than 4 bytes, this would corrupt memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `tx` is a valid pointer and has sufficient space allocated (at least 4 bytes). Alternatively, use a safer memory handling strategy like passing the size of the array as a parameter to verify constraints.
