UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow occurs when calculating `prev` and `next` using bitwise AND on potentially negative `index`. Signed integer overflow is undefined behavior according to the C standard. Additionally, there is potential for accessing out-of-bounds array entries if the calculation of `prev` or `next` produces an invalid index.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The calculation of `prev` and `next` using bitwise operations could result in indices outside the valid bounds of the `ccws` array, potentially leading to out-of-bounds access. The problem arises because the value of `index` is not explicitly guaranteed to be within valid limits.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `index` is validated to be within bounds before the `prev` and `next` calculations to prevent overflow or invalid array indexing. You could add specific checks such as verifying `index >= 0 && index < LCS_NUM_BUFFS`. Replace signed arithmetic operations with unsigned counterparts if necessary to avoid undefined behavior.
