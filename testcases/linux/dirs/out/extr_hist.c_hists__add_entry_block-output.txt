Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hist.c_hists__add_entry_block.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code potentially accesses uninitialized members of the `struct hist_entry` initialized in the function. While `.block_info` and `.hists` are set explicitly, any other members of `struct hist_entry` may remain uninitialized, leading to undefined behavior if these members are accessed inside the `hists__findnew_entry` function.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Uninitialized Variable Usage  
Bug Reason: The same members of `struct hist_entry` that are left uninitialized could cause logical bugs, depending on how they are accessed or processed within the `hists__findnew_entry` function. If these uninitialized values are used in computations or decision-making, they can lead to incorrect behavior or crashes.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Explicitly initialize all members of `struct hist_entry` to safe default values during its creation to avoid UB and related bugs. Example:  
```c
struct hist_entry entry = {
    .block_info = block_info,
    .hists = hists,
    // Initialize other members appropriately
};
```
If zero initialization for all other members is acceptable:
```c
struct hist_entry entry = {0};
entry.block_info = block_info;
entry.hists = hists;
```
