UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is a likely risk of undefined behavior in this function due to signed integer overflow. Specifically, the operation `Index >> 2` is performed on `Index`, which is a signed integer (`int`). If `Index` contains a negative value, the behavior of sign extension during right shift is implementation-defined in this case (though not strictly undefined according to C). Additionally, there is possible UB if a memory-mapped I/O register at `MUnit.OutboundQueue` contains a value that doesn't obey expected constraints (e.g., `Index == 0xFFFFFFFFL`) accessing leads to corrupted functionality.
