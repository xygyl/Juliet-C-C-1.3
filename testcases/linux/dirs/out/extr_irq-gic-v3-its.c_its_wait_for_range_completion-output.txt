UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow in calculation (`delta = rd_idx - prev_idx;`) may occur when `rd_idx` and `prev_idx` are large unsigned integers due to implicit casting of `u64` (unsigned) to `s64` (signed). This is undefined behavior in C as per ยง6.5 of the C standard when signed overflow occurs.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic issue
Bug Reason: The signed overflow leads to incorrect calculation of `delta`, which could cause the loop condition `linear_idx >= to_idx` to fail improperly, leading to timeout and incorrect program behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Avoid signed arithmetic for `delta`. Use `u64` for `delta` and adjust logic to account for wrap-around explicitly with unsigned arithmetic. Example:
```c
u64 delta;

if (rd_idx < prev_idx)
    delta = rd_idx + ITS_CMD_QUEUE_SZ - prev_idx;
else
    delta = rd_idx - prev_idx;
```
This ensures all calculations remain well-defined within unsigned arithmetic bounds.
