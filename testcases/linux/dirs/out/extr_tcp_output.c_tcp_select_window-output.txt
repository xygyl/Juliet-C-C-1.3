**UB Analysis**:
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function contains potential undefined behavior due to the use of the `ALIGN()` macro. If `tcp_sk(sk)->rx_opt.rcv_wscale` holds a value greater than or equal to `sizeof(int)`, the bit shift operation `1 << tp->rx_opt.rcv_wscale` can overflow or cause undefined behavior per the C standard for shift operations. Additionally, performing `ALIGN(cur_win, 1 << tp->rx_opt.rcv_wscale)` might lead to invalid calculations if the shift results in a value larger than `cur_win`. This issue depends on runtime values, and safe guarding against extreme values should be introduced.

**Bug Analysis**:
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: The logic involving `1 << tp->rx_opt.rcv_wscale` could result in integer overflow or undefined behavior depending on the value of `tp->rx_opt.rcv_wscale`. Additionally, passing an invalid alignment value to `ALIGN()` could cause inaccurate results or excessive rounding that breaks the intended function logic. These bugs are caused by inadequate validation of input values like `tp->rx_opt.rcv_wscale`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

**Confidence**: Medium  
While the potential UB is identified as problematic for shifts, runtime verification of `tp->rx_opt.rcv_wscale` values in the kernel may mitigate it. However, there's no explicit protection in the code to confirm this.

**Fix Suggestion**:  
1. Validate `tp->rx_opt.rcv_wscale` to ensure it's within a safe range (e.g., less than the number of bits in an integer). For example:
   ```c
   if (tp->rx_opt.rcv_wscale >= sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT) {
       tp->rx_opt.rcv_wscale = 0; // or handle safely
   }
   ```
2. Add a validity check for any calculations involving `ALIGN()` to ensure alignment values make sense in the function context:
   ```c
   if (tp->rx_opt.rcv_wscale > MAX_SAFE_SHIFT_VALUE) {
       // Handle error or issue warning
   }
   ```
   The exact value for `MAX_SAFE_SHIFT_VALUE` depends on the target architecture (`sizeof(int)` and `CHAR_BIT`) and use case constraints set forth by the Linux kernel.
