UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function performs a `memcmp` operation between `bl_data` and `pmap_data + i`, wherein if `pmap_len` is unusually small and does not fulfill the required memory alignment for `pmap_data + i`, this could lead to undefined behavior (UB) due to invalid memory access. There is also no guarantee that `pmap_data + i` points to valid accessible memory.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Invalid Memory Access
Bug Reason: The function does not reliably check whether `pmap_data + i` is valid and accessible. Before performing the `memcmp` operation, it should ensure the `pmap_data + i` points to a valid memory region of sufficient length. Additionally, the block read operation indicated by `bl_data` and `pmap_data` warrants stricter consistency, accounting additionally beyond..
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
