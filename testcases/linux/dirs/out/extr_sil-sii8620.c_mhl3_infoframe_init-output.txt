UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function writes to `frame->hev_format` and `frame->version` without verifying that the `frame` pointer is non-NULL. If `frame` is NULL, calling `memset(frame, 0, sizeof(*frame))` and accessing `frame->version` or `frame->hev_format` leads to undefined behavior due to dereferencing a NULL pointer.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: Possible null pointer dereference if the caller passes `NULL` for the `frame` parameter. This would cause a crash or undefined behavior in the program.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `frame` is not NULL before performing any operations on it. For example:
```c
if (!frame)
    return -EINVAL;  // or another appropriate error code based on context
```
This would prevent dereferencing a NULL pointer.
