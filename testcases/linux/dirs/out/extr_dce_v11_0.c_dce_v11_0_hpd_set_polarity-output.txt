### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. The function accesses the `hpd_offsets[hpd]` array without bounds checking to ensure that `hpd` is within the valid range of `hpd_offsets`. If `hpd` is out of bounds, this causes undefined behavior due to an out-of-bounds array access.  
2. Pointer arithmetic (`mmDC_HPD_INT_CONTROL + hpd_offsets[hpd]`) depends on `hpd_offsets[hpd]` being valid. If the out-of-bounds access occurs, it leads to an invalid pointer calculation.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason:  
The function does not verify that `hpd` is within bounds for the `hpd_offsets` array before usage. Even though there is a check `if (hpd >= adev->mode_info.num_hpd) return;`, this check only ensures that `hpd` is less than `adev->mode_info.num_hpd`, not whether `hpd` is valid for the `hpd_offsets` array. If `hpd_offsets` has fewer elements than `adev->mode_info.num_hpd`, it can lead to an out-of-bounds access, a bug that can corrupt memory or cause crashes.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Add explicit bounds checking for the `hpd_offsets` array to ensure `hpd` is within its valid range:
```c
if (hpd >= adev->mode_info.num_hpd || hpd < 0 || hpd >= ARRAY_SIZE(hpd_offsets))
    return;
```
Here, `ARRAY_SIZE(hpd_offsets)` should be defined to compute the number of elements in `hpd_offsets`. This ensures no out-of-bounds access occurs, and the function safely operates on the correct array elements.
