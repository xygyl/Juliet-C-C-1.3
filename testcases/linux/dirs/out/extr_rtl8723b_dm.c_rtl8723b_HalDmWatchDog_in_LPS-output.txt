UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: **Accessing scalar field `UndecoratedSmoothedPWDB` in `struct sta_info` without validating whether `psta` is a valid pointer or has valid memory.** Specifically:
- `pdmpriv->EntryMinUndecoratedSmoothedPWDB = psta->rssi_stat.UndecoratedSmoothedPWDB;` assumes that `psta` points to a valid struct, which isn't guaranteed since `psta` is fetched using `rtw_get_stainfo()` but only checked for `NULL`. If an invalid pointer is returned, dereferencing this field may cause undefined behavior.
  
UB also includes potentially dangerous arithmetic overflow checks (e.g., `pDM_DigTable->CurIGValue` comparison logic), although the issue is less critical in this context.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The dereference of `psta->rssi_stat.UndecoratedSmoothedPWDB` in the statement `pdmpriv->EntryMinUndecoratedSmoothedPWDB` without sufficiently ensuring `psta` comes from valid memory or proper initialization may lead to null pointer dereference bugs and runtime crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `psta` is properly validated before dereferencing. For example:
```c
if (psta && psta->rssi_stat.UndecoratedSmoothedPWDB >= 0) {
    pdmpriv->EntryMinUndecoratedSmoothedPWDB = psta->rssi_stat.UndecoratedSmoothedPWDB;
}
```
Additionally, revisit `rtw_get_stainfo()` to ensure it does not return invalid pointers under unexpected conditions.
