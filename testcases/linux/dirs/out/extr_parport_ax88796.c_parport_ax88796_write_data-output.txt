UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Dereferencing a potentially null pointer (`dd`). The function `pp_to_drv(p)` is not defined in the snippet provided, and returns a pointer that may be null on failure. If `dd` is null, accessing `dd->spp_data` results in undefined behavior when it's dereferenced in `writeb(data, dd->spp_data)`.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: A null pointer dereference will occur if `pp_to_drv(p)` returns null, as there is no guard against this before the dereference of `dd->spp_data`. This might lead to a memory access violation and crash the program.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `dd` before dereferencing it. For example:
```c
struct ax_drvdata *dd = pp_to_drv(p);
if (!dd) {
    // Handle error appropriately, e.g., log an error, return early, or assert.
    return;
}
writeb(data, dd->spp_data);
```
