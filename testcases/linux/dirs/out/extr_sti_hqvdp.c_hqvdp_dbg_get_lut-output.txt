UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not validate the pointer `coef` before dereferencing it in calls to `memcmp`. Passing a null pointer (`NULL`) as the `coef` argument would result in undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer inside `memcmp`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If the `coef` argument is `NULL`, this function can trigger undefined behavior when passed to `memcmp`, potentially leading to a crash or unexpected behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for the `coef` pointer at the beginning of the function. For example:
```c
if (coef == NULL)
    return "<UNKNOWN>";
```
This would prevent `memcmp` from executing with a null pointer.
