UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not check if `sock->addr` is a valid pointer before performing pointer arithmetic and dereferencing. If `sock` or `sock->addr` is NULL, dereferencing `sock->addr + ...` exhibits undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `sock` or the `addr` field of `sock` is NULL, the function will attempt to access an invalid memory location, causing a null pointer dereference. This bug can crash the program or lead to other erratic behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add checks to verify that `sock` is non-NULL and `sock->addr` is a valid pointer before performing pointer arithmetic or dereferencing. Example:
```c
if (!sock || !sock->addr) {
    // Handle error or provide fallback behavior
    return;
}
```
