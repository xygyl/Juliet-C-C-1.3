Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_psock_fanout.c_test_datapath.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The return value of the `munmap` and `close` system calls is checked against `0`, but these system calls return `-1` on failure, not `0`. Therefore, this comparison is incorrect and could result in undefined behavior due to accessing invalid memory or improperly closed file descriptors after an incorrect assumption of successful calls. Additionally, `exit(1)` is called without releasing resources, which can lead to resource leaks.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, resource leak  
Bug Reason: The `exit(1)` calls after `munmap` and `close` failures terminate the program without ensuring proper cleanup of acquired resources or opened file descriptors, leading to a resource leak. Furthermore, the incorrect comparison of system call results (`munmap` and `close`) against `0` leads to flawed logic that can result in undesired behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Correctly check the return values of `munmap` and `close` against `-1`, not `0`.  
2. Ensure proper cleanup of resources before invoking `exit(1)` if a failure occurs.  
3. Implement graceful error handling to avoid abrupt program termination and resource leak.  
For example:
```c
if (munmap(rings[1], RING_NUM_FRAMES * getpagesize()) == -1 ||
    munmap(rings[0], RING_NUM_FRAMES * getpagesize()) == -1) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to unmap rings\n");
    // Cleanup and continue or gracefully exit with resource release
}

if (close(fds_udp[1][1]) == -1 || close(fds_udp[1][0]) == -1 ||
    close(fds_udp[0][1]) == -1 || close(fds_udp[0][0]) == -1 ||
    close(fds[1]) == -1 || close(fds[0]) == -1) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to close file descriptors\n");
    // Cleanup and continue or gracefully exit with resource release
}
```
