Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mtk_dpi.c_mtk_dpi_encoder_destroy.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function `drm_encoder_cleanup` is called with `encoder` as a parameter, but the code does not validate if `encoder` is `NULL`. If `encoder` is `NULL`, passing it to `drm_encoder_cleanup` would result in undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `encoder` is `NULL` and the function is called, `drm_encoder_cleanup(encoder)` may attempt to dereference the null pointer, leading to a runtime crash or other unintended behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for `encoder` being NULL at the beginning of the `mtk_dpi_encoder_destroy` function, such as:
```c
if (encoder == NULL)
    return;
```
This ensures `drm_encoder_cleanup` is never called with a `NULL` pointer.
