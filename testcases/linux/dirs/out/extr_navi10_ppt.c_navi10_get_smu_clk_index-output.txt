Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_navi10_ppt.c_navi10_get_smu_clk_index.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `index` is greater than or equal to `SMU_CLK_COUNT`, the code accesses `navi10_clk_map[index]`, which is an out-of-bound array access. This is a form of undefined behavior according to the C standard. There is no guarantee that invalid indices are checked before this access occurs.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: Since there is no array size validation before accessing `navi10_clk_map[index]` in the assignment `mapping = navi10_clk_map[index]`, this leads to an out-of-bounds read when `index >= SMU_CLK_COUNT`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a conditional check prior to accessing the array. Move the statement `mapping = navi10_clk_map[index];` inside the first `if` block to ensure `index >= SMU_CLK_COUNT` is validated before this access. The corrected code would be:  

```c
static int navi10_get_smu_clk_index(struct smu_context *smc, uint32_t index)
{
    if (index >= SMU_CLK_COUNT)
        return -EINVAL;

    struct smu_11_0_cmn2aisc_mapping mapping = navi10_clk_map[index];
    if (!mapping.valid_mapping)
        return -EINVAL;

    return mapping.map_to;
}
```
