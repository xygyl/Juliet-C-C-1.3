UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The variable `pdata` is dereferenced and its members are accessed in the line `if (pdata->n++ == pdata->index)` and later lines without verifying if `pdata` is `NULL`. If `pdata` is null, this operation causes undefined behavior due to a null pointer dereference.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: `pdata` could potentially be `NULL`, leading to null pointer dereference when accessing `pdata->n` or `pdata->index`. This would crash the program or exhibit undefined behavior. The function does not validate the pointer before dereferencing.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a check for `pdata == NULL` at the start of the function. For example:  
```c
if (!pdata) {
    return -EINVAL; // Replace -EINVAL with the appropriate error code.
}
```
Ensure that callers of this function guarantee non-null inputs or handle the error if `pdata` is `NULL`.
