UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The division `detile_buf_plane1_addr = (detile_buf_size_in_bytes / 2.0 / 64.0);` performs division involving a floating-point number (`2.0`), but the result is assigned back to an unsigned integer (`detile_buf_plane1_addr`). This can lead to undefined behavior if the resultant value exceeds the range of `unsigned int`, as the cast truncates the value potentially causing data loss. Furthermore, the expression `(detile_buf_size_in_bytes / 2.0 / 64.0)` uses floating-point division inappropriately when working with unsigned integers, which could result in subtle errors.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The logic for `detile_buf_plane1_addr` assignment is flawed for scenarios where `detile_buf_size_in_bytes` is too small to correctly allocate memory for chroma buffer. If the condition `(double) rq_param.misc.rq_l.stored_swath_bytes / (double) rq_param.misc.rq_c.stored_swath_bytes <= 1.5` is true, there is a risk that the allocated chroma buffer is insufficient, leading to potential memory corruption or incorrect behavior. Additionally, floating-point arithmetic could interfere with precision, impacting correctness.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes/No (Partial overlap; undefined behavior contributes to incorrect output, but logic flaw is independent.)
Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion:
1. Cast floating-point division results explicitly and use integer arithmetic:
   ```c
   detile_buf_plane1_addr = detile_buf_size_in_bytes / 2 / 64; /* ensure integer division */
   ```
2. Validate `detile_buf_size_in_bytes` to ensure it falls within a safe range for subsequent calculations.
3. Avoid using floating-point arithmetic for integer-compatible computations; refactor performance-critical logic accordingly to prevent loss of precision.
