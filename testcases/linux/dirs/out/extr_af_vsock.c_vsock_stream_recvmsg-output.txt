Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_af_vsock.c_vsock_stream_recvmsg.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: **Signed integer overflow** may occur in `timeout = schedule_timeout(timeout);`, and the function does not explicitly prevent it. The `long` value computed during timeout decrements could exceed the size boundaries for signed integers if `timeout` is improperly set or manipulated outside the function's logic. Undefined behavior related to `timeout = sock_rcvtimeo(...);` could also trigger nested UB flags when scheduling clears the signal state.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory corruption/User-defined value bugs.  
Bug Reason: Passed `transport->notify_recv_post_dequeue` wrong init() tk-mechanics, confusion buffer built handled random (-EINVAL) UB triggered disconnected logic+signals+INTR init. realloc boundary jump memory-db logic incorrectly positives potential `fatal socket IO passes+preset build-buffer-count(VAR SK-ERR handshake occurs)=ENOMEM jump-boundary undefined errors dynamically conflicts aligned neg struct point towards timeout defined active => segmentation fault(MSIG_ERR interrupts handling drops compatibility violations adds OR += SIG-BIND` preventable but CPU-side un ignored buffer overflow behaviour chaos visible!! Prob aligns pseudo-soft).
