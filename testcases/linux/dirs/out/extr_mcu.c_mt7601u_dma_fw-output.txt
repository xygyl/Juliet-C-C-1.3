Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mcu.c_mt7601u_dma_fw.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The expression `data + n` involves pointer arithmetic on a `void *`. In C, performing arithmetic directly on a `void *` is undefined behavior because `void` has an incomplete type, and the size of "1" is not defined. Pointer arithmetic requires complete types.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Pointer Arithmetic/Undefined Behavior and Potential Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The undefined behavior highlighted above could result in incorrect runtime behavior, including crashes or unintended memory accesses. Additionally, if the code assumes that the pointer arithmetic works, the subsequent `__mt7601u_dma_fw` and recursive `mt7601u_dma_fw` calls might process incorrect memory addresses and corrupt data or trigger logic errors.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Cast `data` to `const char *` or `const uint8_t *` (appropriate type for byte-based computations) before performing pointer arithmetic. For example:
```c
    return mt7601u_dma_fw(dev, dma_buf, (const char *)data + n, len - n, dst_addr + n);
```
This ensures valid pointer arithmetic.
