Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_turbostat.c_get_die_id.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code attempts to pass a formatted string `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu%d/topology/die_id` with `%d` placeholder into the `parse_int_file` function, but there's no evidence that `parse_int_file` properly handles string formatting or variable substitution for `%d`. The behavior is undefined if `parse_int_file` expects a completely resolved string and does not perform format substitution. Furthermore, depending on its implementation, `parse_int_file` could dereference invalid pointers or fail to process the format placeholder correctly.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function `parse_int_file` is called with a string containing a format specifier (`%d`) and an integer variable (`cpu`). If `parse_int_file` expects a resolved file path and does not handle string formatting internally (e.g., via `snprintf` or similar), the string may not resolve, leading to incorrect file access logic or runtime errors. This could result in failure to open, read, or process the intended file.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Modify the `get_die_id` function to resolve the formatted string before passing it into `parse_int_file`. Use `snprintf` or a similar function to ensure the format specifier (`%d`) is replaced by the actual value of `cpu`. Example:
```c
char path[256];
snprintf(path, sizeof(path), "/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu%d/topology/die_id", cpu);
return parse_int_file(path, cpu);
```
This guarantees that the file path is correctly resolved before being passed to `parse_int_file`.
