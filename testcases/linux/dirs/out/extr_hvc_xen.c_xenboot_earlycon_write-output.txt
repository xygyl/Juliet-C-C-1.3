UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not validate whether the `string` pointer is `NULL`. Dereferencing or using `NULL` as an argument in `dom0_write_console(0, NULL, len)` constitutes undefined behavior as no checks or guarantees are made.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `string` is passed as `NULL`, it could cause runtime issues like crashes or undefined behavior in the `dom0_write_console` function, depending on its implementation.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `string` at the start of the function:
```c
if (string == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
