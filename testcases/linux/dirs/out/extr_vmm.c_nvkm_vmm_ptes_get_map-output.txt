### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses a signed integer constant (`-ENOMEM`) to denote an error state, but the return value of the function (`nvkm_vmm_ptes_get_map`) is defined as `int`. While this is explicitly allowed by the C standard (negative values in accordance with signed types), the unsigned argument (`u64 size`) may lead to type mismatch and trigger overflow conditions in subsequent operations. Specifically, the subtraction operation (`size = fail - addr`) could potentially wrap values inappropriately due to pass-through unsigned returns. Additionally, `~0ULL` is used as a special failure marker without ensuring strict checks against variable types, which creates possible undefined behavior in parameterized scope.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Undefined parameter oversight
Bug Reason: Systems provide excess coverage for ordering but relay correctness validation except  buffers attached guarantiously
