Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_audit.c_audit_log_feature_change.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses `audit_feature_names[which]` without bounds-checking the `which` variable. If `which` is negative or exceeds the valid bounds of the `audit_feature_names` array, this results in an out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw / Potential out-of-bounds memory access  
Bug Reason: The lack of bounds checking for the `which` variable implies that the function might access memory outside the valid bounds of `audit_feature_names`. This could lead to crashes or unintended behavior depending on the runtime environment.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking for the `which` parameter to ensure that it is within the valid range of the `audit_feature_names` array. For example:
```c
if (which < 0 || which >= VALID_AUDIT_FEATURE_COUNT) {
    return; // Or handle the invalid case appropriately
}
```
Replace `VALID_AUDIT_FEATURE_COUNT` with the actual size of the `audit_feature_names` array.
