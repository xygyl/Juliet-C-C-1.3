Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_annotate.c_annotation__init_column_widths.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Calling **`hex_width(symbol__size(sym))`** and **`hex_width(sym->end)`** without verifying that the `sym` pointer is non-NULL can result in undefined behavior. If `sym` were to be NULL, this would cause a null pointer dereference. Another possible undefined behavior could occur if **`symbol__size(sym)`** or **`sym->end`** return invalid values that lead to subsequent calculations or dereferencing invalid memory.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The code does not validate that the pointer `sym` passed into the function is non-NULL before dereferencing it. This could lead to a crash in scenarios where a NULL pointer is passed to the function.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `sym` is not NULL. For example:  

```c
if (sym == NULL) {
    // Handle the NULL case appropriately, such as logging, default values, or returning early.
    return;
}
```
This ensures that no operations occur on a NULL pointer, avoiding undefined behavior and potential bugs.
