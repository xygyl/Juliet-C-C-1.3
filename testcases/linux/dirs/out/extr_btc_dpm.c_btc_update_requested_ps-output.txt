### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `rv770_get_ps` is called with `rps`, which could potentially be `NULL` depending on how this function is invoked. Since `rv770_get_ps` is not provided, we cannot confirm it handles `NULL` pointers. If `rps` is `NULL`, dereferencing it later (e.g., via `*rps`) will result in undefined behavior. Additionally, assigning `&eg_pi->requested_ps` (a local structure member) back to the `ps_priv` pointer of `requested_rps` could become problematic if `ps_priv` is later accessed without ensuring its validity.  
Confidence: Medium

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If the `rps` parameter is `NULL`, `rv770_get_ps(rps)` will dereference `NULL` inside `rv770_get_ps`. Similarly, while dereferencing or modifying `eg_pi->requested_rps.ps_priv`, there could be memory management issues if `ps_priv` is accessed outside the designed flow.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium

### Fix Suggestion
Before calling `rv770_get_ps`, ensure that `rps` is not `NULL`. Add a check at the start of the function:
```c
if (!rps) {
    return; // Or handle the error appropriately
}
```

Additionally, confirm the validity of `eg_pi` returned by `evergreen_get_pi`. If `evergreen_get_pi` can return `NULL`, add a check before accessing its members:
```c
if (!eg_pi) {
    return; // Or handle the error appropriately
}
```

This ensures safer operations and prevents undefined behavior.
