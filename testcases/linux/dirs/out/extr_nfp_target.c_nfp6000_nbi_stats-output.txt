UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The macro `AT` expands to perform undefined behavior if, as is implied here, it tries to execute branch-switches or similar constructs passed possibly hard `folding testcase`-denotations inline similar low-breaking purely runtime conditional control side-effects _need also external parameter size logic guard probe. Undefined Control Bi compact-case-prefixation missing cannot trigger intensive test verification.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The `switch` implementation does not visible restrict validity bounds of the `cpp_id`. Invalid inputs could produce unexpected outcomes since macros `AT` lack proper verification `case guard`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
Replace the `AT()` macros with more testable/maintainable logic (like functions or direct checks) that ensure comprehensive coverage or embed runtime-safe checks over conditional range/related applicable usage always when expanded macros expands outside disputed/incomplete remainder similar sources matcher integration expectations outline.
