UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not check whether `lli` is NULL before dereferencing it. If `lli` is NULL, dereferencing its members (`lli->src_addr`, `lli->dst_addr`, `lli->control`, and `lli->link_addr`) results in undefined behavior (null pointer dereference).

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw / Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: The function assumes `lli` is a valid non-NULL pointer without verifying it. If the `lli` pointer is NULL, it causes a null pointer dereference when performing operations on its fields.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `lli` is not NULL before dereferencing it. For example:
```c
if (!lli)
    return -EINVAL; // or some appropriate error code
```
