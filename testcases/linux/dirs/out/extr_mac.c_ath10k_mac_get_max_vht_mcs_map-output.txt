Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mac.c_ath10k_mac_get_max_vht_mcs_map.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `nss` parameter is unchecked for validity, and shifting beyond the width of the `mcs_map` (16 bits) causes undefined behavior. Specifically, `(2 * nss)` may exceed the bit-width of `mcs_map` (16 bits) if `nss` is sufficiently large. Left-shifting beyond the width of type `u16` is undefined according to the C standard.
  
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: An invalid `nss` value (greater than 7) causes incorrect behavior due to undefined shifts. Logic assumes valid `nss` input without verification, leading to silent errors or unintended results. Unsafe integer-overlap may also result in unpredictable calculations.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `nss` is validated to be within a safe range (e.g., between 0 and 7). For example:
```c
if (nss < 0 || nss > 7) {
    return 0; // Handle invalid input gracefully.
}
```
