### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not perform boundary checks before accessing elements of the `buf` array after finding an SPS header. Specifically:
  - `buf[0]` and `buf[2]` are accessed without validating that `buf + 2` is within valid bounds (i.e., does not exceed the `end` pointer). If `buf + 2` exceeds `end` following the `coda_find_nal_header` function, this results in out‐of‐bounds memory access, which is undefined behavior as per the C standard.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Access  
Bug Reason: As noted in the UB analysis, there is a potential out-of-bounds memory access when `buf[0]` and `buf[2]` are accessed without verifying if `buf + 2` is within the bounds of the buffer. This can lead to unintended behavior or crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
Before accessing `buf[0]` and `buf[2]`, validate that `buf + 2` is within the bounds of the buffer:
```c
if (buf + 2 >= end)
    return -EINVAL;
ctx->params.h264_profile_idc = buf[0];
ctx->params.h264_level_idc = buf[2];
```
This ensures memory safety by preventing out-of-bounds access.
