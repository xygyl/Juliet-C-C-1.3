UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `irq_num` is assigned the return value of `of_irq_get(np, 0)`, but the code does not check if `irq_num` has a value of `-1`, which indicates an error. Using `irq_num` in later operations without confirming it's valid may lead to undefined behavior depending on its usage.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: If `irq_num` returned by `of_irq_get` is `-1` (indicating an error) and execution reaches `omap_prcm_register_chain_handler()`, this could lead to registering a chain handler with an invalid interrupt number. Logic does not ensure proper handling of this case.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add explicit validation for the `irq_num` value after calling `of_irq_get(np, 0)` to ensure it's not `-1` before proceeding. For example:  

```c
irq_num = of_irq_get(np, 0);
if (irq_num < 0) {
    pr_err("PRM: Failed to get IRQ number\n");
    return irq_num;
}
```  
This ensures only valid interrupt numbers are processed, avoiding undefined behavior and logical flaws.
