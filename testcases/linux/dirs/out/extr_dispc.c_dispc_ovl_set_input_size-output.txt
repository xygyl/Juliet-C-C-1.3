UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The subtraction operations `(width - 1)` and `(height - 1)` can lead to signed integer overflow or underflow if `width` or `height` are zero. Signed integer overflow is undefined behavior in C.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic and Memory-related Bug
Bug Reason: If `width` or `height` are less than or equal to 0, the computed value for `val` can result in incorrect and potentially out-of-range writes via `dispc_write_reg()`, which may lead to hardware misconfiguration, undefined register states, or unexpected behavior. Moreover, no checks are made for the validity of `plane` (e.g., whether it matches a valid enum value).
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to ensure that `width` and `height` are greater than zero before performing the subtraction. Additionally, validate the `plane` argument to ensure it is a valid `omap_plane_id` value.

Example Fix:
```c
if (width <= 0 || height <= 0) {
    // Handle invalid dimensions
    return;
}

if (plane < OMAP_DSS_GFX || plane > OMAP_DSS_WB) {
    // Handle invalid plane ID
    return;
}
```
