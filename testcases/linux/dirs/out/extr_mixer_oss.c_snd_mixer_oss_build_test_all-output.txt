UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses `sprintf` without checking the bounds of the `str` buffer. The variable `str` is statically allocated with a size of 64 bytes, but the length of `ptr->name` is not validated and could exceed the buffer capacity, leading to buffer overflowâ€”a form of undefined behavior as per C standard requirements.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The unchecked size of `ptr->name` can cause `sprintf` to write past the 64-byte buffer `str`, which results in a memory corruption issue and potential security vulnerability. This is directly tied to the undefined behavior detected.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use `snprintf` instead of `sprintf` and validate the length of `ptr->name` beforehand to ensure it does not exceed the buffer size. Example fix: `snprintf(str, sizeof(str), "%s Switch", ptr->name);` Additionally, ensure that `ptr->name` safely fits within `sizeof(str)` during function invocation or check it beforehand.
