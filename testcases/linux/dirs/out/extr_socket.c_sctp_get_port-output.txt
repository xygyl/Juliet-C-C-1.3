Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_socket.c_sctp_get_port.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Dereferencing null pointers is possible. Dereferencing `af` can lead to undefined behavior if `sctp_sk(sk)->pf->af` is null. Likewise, `sctp_sk(sk)` or `sctp_sk(sk)->pf` may be null, which would lead to undefined behavior during field accesses.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The code does not appear to handle cases where `sctp_sk(sk)->pf` or `sctp_sk(sk)->pf->af` could be null. If these are null, `af->from_sk` would attempt to dereference null, causing a runtime error.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit checks for null pointers before dereferencing:
```c
if (!sctp_sk(sk) || !sctp_sk(sk)->pf || !sctp_sk(sk)->pf->af)
    return -EINVAL; // or some error handling code
af = sctp_sk(sk)->pf->af;
```
