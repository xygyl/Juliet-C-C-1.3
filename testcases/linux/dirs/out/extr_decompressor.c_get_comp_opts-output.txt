Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_decompressor.c_get_comp_opts.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Possible dereferencing of null pointers in `squashfs_page_actor_init` and `squashfs_comp_opts`. If memory allocation via `kmalloc()` fails and `buffer` remains `NULL`, functions relying on it may result in undefined behavior depending on their implementations. Adding a strong null guard in `squashfs_page_actor_init` and `squashfs_comp_opts` would mitigate undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related and Logic bug
Bug Reason: The function does not correctly handle errors in memory allocation and cleanup:
1. `kmalloc()` and `squashfs_page_actor_init()` are not guaranteed to succeed, missing proper chaining action finally.
