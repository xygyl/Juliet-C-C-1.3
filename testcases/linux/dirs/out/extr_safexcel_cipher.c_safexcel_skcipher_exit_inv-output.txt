UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The macro `EIP197_REQUEST_ON_STACK(req, skcipher, EIP197_SKCIPHER_REQ_SIZE)` expands into code that allocates memory on the stack by casting. If the stack allocation doesn't properly align the memory or creates a misaligned pointer, accessing `req` can cause undefined behavior due to memory misalignment rules. Furthermore, undefined behavior may result if the size of memory allocated isn't properly checked before `memset()` is used.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related bug
Bug Reason: The `memset()` function overwrites the memory of `req`. If the size of `req` was incorrectly allocated, this operation could lead to undefined behavior or corruption of adjacent stack memory. Additionally, depending on the implementation of `EIP197_REQUEST_ON_STACK`, the structure pointed to by `req` may not be fully initialized, causing issues in downstream usage. There might also be an implicit assumption that `req` points to a valid memory region large enough to support the operations that follow, which is risky without validation.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
1. Validate the macro `EIP197_REQUEST_ON_STACK` to ensure that the memory allocated for `req` is aligned and properly sized.
2. Replace the usage of `memset(req, 0, sizeof(struct skcipher_request))` with a safer initialization mechanism if the allocated memory size for `req` is smaller than `sizeof(struct skcipher_request)`.
3. Use dynamic memory allocation with `kmalloc()` if the stack allocation mechanism is questionable. This ensures stability regardless of stack alignment or allocation issues.
