Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel-pt-decoder.c_intel_pt_get_split_psb.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential overflow during pointer arithmetic. In `decoder->next_buf = decoder->buf + rest_psb;` and `decoder->next_len = decoder->len - rest_psb;`, if `rest_psb` is larger than `decoder->len`, this could lead to accessing memory outside the bounds of `decoder->buf` or negative values for `decoder->next_len`, both of which are undefined behaviors. Additionally, there is no validation ensuring that `rest_psb` is never greater than `decoder->len`, which could cause these issues.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory corruption / Invalid memory access
Bug Reason: The unchecked `rest_psb` value could lead to `decoder->next_buf` pointing outside the intended buffer range, potentially causing access to invalid memory. Similarly, `decoder->next_len` could hold an invalid negative value. These issues could lead to crashes or corruption during subsequent use of these fields.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checks to verify that `rest_psb <= decoder->len` before performing any pointer arithmetic or assignments involving `decoder->buf`, `decoder->len`, and `decoder->next_buf`. If `rest_psb` is not within valid bounds, return an error code or handle the situation gracefully.

Example fix:
```c
if (rest_psb > decoder->len) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return an error if rest_psb exceeds the buffer's length.
}
decoder->next_buf = decoder->buf + rest_psb;
decoder->next_len = decoder->len - rest_psb;
```
