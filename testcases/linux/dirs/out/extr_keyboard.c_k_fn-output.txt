Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_keyboard.c_k_fn.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing out-of-bounds memory if `value` exceeds the bounds of the `func_table` array. The array size is not validated for `value`, leading to undefined behavior as per the C standard by potentially accessing invalid memory.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `value` is always within the valid bounds of the `func_table` array. However, there is no validation of `value` before accessing `kbd->func_table[value]`. If `value` exceeds the length of the array, the program attempts to access memory outside the array, leading to potential crashes or incorrect behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `value` falls within the valid bounds of the `func_table` array before accessing it. For example:
```c
unsigned int func_table_size = sizeof(kbd->func_table) / sizeof(kbd->func_table[0]);
if (value < func_table_size && kbd->func_table[value])
    kbd_puts_queue(kbd->port, kbd->func_table[value]);
```
