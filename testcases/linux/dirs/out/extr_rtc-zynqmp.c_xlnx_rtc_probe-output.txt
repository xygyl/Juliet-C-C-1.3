UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `platform_get_irq_byname` can return a negative value for errors, but the returned value is assigned to `xrtcdev->alarm_irq` (of type `scalar_t__`, likely arithmetic or pointer type). In the subsequent call to `devm_request_irq`, the negative value may lead to undefined behavior because interrupt numbers are typically expected to be non-negative integers.   

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The logic assumes that negative error codes returned by `platform_get_irq_byname` will propagate safely through assignment and later function calls, but using negative values in `devm_request_irq` can lead to incorrect behavior or undefined results. Furthermore, the code does not explicitly check or handle failure cases for `xrtcdev->alarm_irq` before calling `devm_request_irq`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Explicitly check for negative values returned by `platform_get_irq_byname` and handle them before proceeding further in the code. For example:
```c
xrtcdev->alarm_irq = platform_get_irq_byname(pdev, "alarm");
if (xrtcdev->alarm_irq < 0) {
    dev_err(&pdev->dev, "Failed to get 'alarm' IRQ");
    return xrtcdev->alarm_irq;
}
```
Apply similar checks for `xrtcdev->sec_irq` after calling `platform_get_irq_byname`.
