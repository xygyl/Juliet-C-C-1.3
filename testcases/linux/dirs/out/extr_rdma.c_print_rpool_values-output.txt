### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function contains an implicit unsigned-to-signed conversion in the `seq_printf` call, where the unsigned integer `value` is passed as `%d`, assuming an `int` formatting. If `value` exceeds the range of a signed integer, the behavior becomes undefined. Specifically, conversions from `u32` (`unsigned int` type) to `int` and scenarios with values exceeding `INT_MAX` could result in undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The type mismatch between `u32` (unsigned 32-bit value) and `%d` (signed integer format specifier) in `seq_printf` can lead to incorrect representation of values. Furthermore, if `value == S32_MAX`, the output may not be formatted correctly due to the representation mismatch.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:  
Modify the format specifier in the `seq_printf` call to `%u` for unsigned integer values to match the `u32` type. Example:  
```c
seq_printf(sf, "%u", value);
```  

This ensures correct representation of unsigned values and eliminates the undefined behavior.
