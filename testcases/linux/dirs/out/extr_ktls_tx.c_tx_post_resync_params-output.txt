### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: 
The function does not perform any operations that violate the C standard. The following points have been checked:
- No signed integer arithmetic is present, so no risk of signed integer overflow.
- Pointers such as `rec_seq` and `sq` are used carefully and initialized before any dereference.
- Memory operations (`memcmp` and `memcpy`) are performed within valid bounds of the memory allocated (via `rec_seq_sz`).
- Strict aliasing rules are not violated, as there is no improper typecasting or reinterpretation of memory.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason:
The function computes `skip_static_post` as `!memcmp(rec_seq, &rn_be, rec_seq_sz)`, to decide whether or not to skip updating the `rec_seq` buffer via `memcpy`. However:
1. If `rec_seq_sz` exceeds `sizeof(__be64)` (due to a mismatch in size definitions related to `info->rec_seq`), `memcmp` may access out-of-bound memory.
2. There's an implicit assumption that the size of `info->rec_seq` and `rn_be` are compatible, which may cause unpredictable behavior if this assumption fails.
3. No validation or bounds-checking is performed on the size of `rec_seq_sz`.

Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: Medium  
The logic flaw detected relies on the assumption of size compatibility, which cannot be conclusively validated from the provided code snippet. However, it introduces a potential risk for unexpected behavior in execution.

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Replace the fixed size computation of `rec_seq_sz = sizeof(info->rec_seq)` with a compile-time assertion ensuring `info->rec_seq` and `rn_be` are always compatible:
   ```c
   static_assert(sizeof(info->rec_seq) == sizeof(__be64), "rec_seq and rn_be must have matching size");
   ```
2. Explicitly verify that the size of `rec_seq_sz` is less than or equal to `sizeof(__be64)` before calling `memcmp` or `memcpy`:
   ```c
   if (rec_seq_sz > sizeof(__be64)) {
       // Handle size mismatch error gracefully
       return;
   }
   ```
3. Prevent hardcoded size usage to improve type safety and reduce potential mismatch errors.
