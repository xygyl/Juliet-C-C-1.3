Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_signature.c_encrypt_blob.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function `encrypt_blob` does not validate that the `params` parameter is non-NULL before dereferencing it (`params->op = kernel_pkey_encrypt;`). This can lead to undefined behavior if `encrypt_blob` is called with a NULL `params` pointer.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `encrypt_blob` is called with a NULL `params` pointer, dereferencing it (`params->op = kernel_pkey_encrypt;`) will cause a segmentation fault. This is a memory-related bug.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL check for `params` at the beginning of the function and return an appropriate error code if it is NULL:
```c
if (params == NULL)
    return -EINVAL; // Or another suitable error code
```
