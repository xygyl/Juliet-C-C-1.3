UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `alloc_pgt_page` function is a stub, returning a scalar (`NULL`) instead of properly allocating memory. If the stub is intended to provide an actual allocated page, dereferencing the pointer (`p4d` or `pud`) without proper memory will cause undefined behavior. Furthermore, potential type aliasing mismatches exist in casting scalar types to pointers or performing arithmetic directly on pointers. In addition, inappropriate strict alias rules for pointers converting for stored intermediate PTE-tagged address may undermine alignment constraints "appropriate flags for an intermediateâ€¦"
