UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow may occur when multiplying `val * 830` or adding the result to `52120` since the range of `s8` (-128 to 127) and the resultant intermediate computations exceed the limits of typical signed integer arithmetic. Signed integer overflow constitutes undefined behavior in C.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw due to UB  
Bug Reason: When signed integer overflow occurs, the program's behavior is undefined, potentially yielding incorrect results or causing runtime errors. The formula's assumption that `val` produces meaningful output for all `s8` values could produce unintended results.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Change the `s8` type to an unsigned or wider integer type, such as `int` or `long`, to ensure no overflow occurs during intermediate calculations. Alternatively, use checked arithmetic to detect overflow (e.g., compiler-specific flags or runtime guards).
