Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_lru_cache.c_lc_reset.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Pointer arithmetic (`void* p = e; p -= lc->element_off;`) violates the rules of pointer arithmetic in the C standard when applied to non-array object types. Specifically, subtracting from a `void*` pointer is undefined behavior since `void*` is an incomplete type. Pointer arithmetic is only well-defined on complete object types such as `char*` or `int*`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Invalid Memory Access  
Bug Reason: The subtraction on `void*` may lead to an invalid pointer address, which could cause a memory access violation when the `memset(p, 0, lc->element_size)` operation is performed. This code may attempt to access or modify unintended parts of memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `void*` with a properly typed pointer (e.g., `char*`) before performing pointer arithmetic, like this:  
```c
char *p = (char *)e;  
p -= lc->element_off;  
memset(p, 0, lc->element_size);  
```  
This ensures pointer arithmetic is performed on a complete type (`char*`) in compliance with the C standard.
