UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences the pointer `risc` without checking if it is NULL, leading to potential undefined behavior in cases where a NULL or invalid pointer is passed.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function assumes the `risc` pointer is always valid. If a caller passes a NULL pointer to `risc`, attempting to access `risc->dma` and `risc->size` will lead to a crash or undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for a NULL pointer condition at the start of the function:
```c
if (!risc)
    return 0;
```
