UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The expression `1u << (pin_number % 4)` can result in undefined behavior if `pin_number` is manipulated such that the shift exceeds the width of the `unsigned int` type. Although `pin_number % 4` limits the result to range [0, 3], if pin_number's initial value is undefined or too large as passed, there could be potential UB.
