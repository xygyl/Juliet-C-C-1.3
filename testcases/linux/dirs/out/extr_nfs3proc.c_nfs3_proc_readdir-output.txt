Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nfs3proc.c_nfs3_proc_readdir.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: A signed-to-unsigned cast is performed when logging the `cookie` variable in `dprintk`, which has type `u64` (a signed `long long`) but is cast to `unsigned int`. If `cookie` holds a value too large for `unsigned int` or is negative, this may lead to unexpected behavior, especially during arithmetic operations internally.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw, Potential Overflow in Debug Logging
Bug Reason: When casting the `cookie` variable for logging, loss of information may occur if the value exceeds the range of `unsigned int` or contains a negative value, causing incorrect output or misleading debug information.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Modify the debug logging line to use `%llu` for logging `cookie` directly as an unsigned 64-bit integer, ensuring no unintended truncation:

```c
dprintk("NFS call  readdir%s %llu\n", 
        plus? "plus" : "", (unsigned long long) cookie);
```
