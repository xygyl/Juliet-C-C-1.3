Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_stat-display.c_print_aggr_thread.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The call to `fprintf(output, "%s", prefix)` does not check if `prefix` is `NULL`. If `prefix` is `NULL`, passing it as the string argument to `fprintf` will lead to undefined behavior, as `%s` expects a valid null-terminated string.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: If `prefix` happens to be `NULL`, the program will attempt to dereference an invalid pointer in `fprintf`, potentially causing a crash. This is a logic error that violates the assumption that `prefix` is valid.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null-check for the `prefix` variable before its usage. For example:  
```c
if (prefix)
    fprintf(output, "%s", prefix);
```
