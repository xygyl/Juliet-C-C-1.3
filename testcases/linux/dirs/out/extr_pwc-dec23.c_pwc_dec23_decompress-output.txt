### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Pointer arithmetic on the `dst` pointer is being performed without proper type-casting in the expressions such as `pout_planar_u = dst + plane_size;`. These computations assume that `dst` is of type `unsigned char*`, but it is declared as `void*`. Pointer arithmetic on `void*` is undefined behavior in C, as the size of the `void` type is not defined.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Pointer miscalculation / memory corruption  
Bug Reason: Since the pointer arithmetic is not correctly handled due to the undefined behavior (UB), the offset calculations for the planar Y, U, and V image planes are likely incorrect. This could lead to out-of-bounds memory access or memory corruption when accessing or writing to `pout_planar_y`, `pout_planar_u`, or `pout_planar_v`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
1. Cast `dst` to `unsigned char*` before performing pointer arithmetic to ensure proper address calculations:
   ```c
   unsigned char *dst_byte_ptr = (unsigned char*)dst;
   pout_planar_y = dst_byte_ptr;
   pout_planar_u = dst_byte_ptr + plane_size;
   pout_planar_v = dst_byte_ptr + plane_size + plane_size / 4;
   ```
2. Ensure that `plane_size` calculations and other offsets do not result in buffer overruns or memory corruption by validating `pdev->height` and `pdev->width`. For example:
   ```c
   if (plane_size > MAX_SIZE_LIMIT) {
       return; // Handle oversized buffer gracefully
   }
   ```
