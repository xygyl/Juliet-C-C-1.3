UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior due to division by zero when `m_den` is zero (`do_div(res, (m_den >> shift))`). The `if (!m_num || !m_den)` condition ensures early exit, but undefined behavior could occur if the type of `m_den` allows any non-standard usage outside the intended exit logic. Additionally, `m_den >> shift` could also potentially result in UB if `shift` exceeds the bit-width of `m_den` (e.g., 32 bits for `u32`).

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Division by zero
Bug Reason: Division by zero could occur in the `do_div(res, (m_den >> shift))` when `m_den` remains zero and its right shift (`>> shift`) doesn't affect the condition. Furthermore, the logic for shifting (`while (res & 0xffff00000000ULL)`) may conceal inaccuracies in this divisor computation for large values in `m_num`..
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Add more sanity checks before performing a division operation. Specifically:
   - Ensure that `shift` does not exceed the bit-width of `m_den` (e.g., for `u32` it should be below 32).
   - Ensure `m_den` remains consistently valid for division in all paths or document expected invariants clearly.
For example:
```c
if (!m_den || (shift >= 32)) {
    return 0;
}
```
