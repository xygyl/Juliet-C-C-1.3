Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_lm90.c_temp_from_s8.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow may occur when `val * 1000` is computed for values very close to the limit of `s8` (127 or -128). Signed integer overflow is undefined behavior in C.
Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: None
Bug Reason: While signed integer overflow can theoretically cause undefined behavior, the function is otherwise logically correct in its purpose and does not introduce any new bugs beyond the UB itself.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use type casting to a wider integer type (e.g., `int`) before performing the multiplication: `return (int)val * 1000;`. This avoids possible overflow for large values of `val`.
