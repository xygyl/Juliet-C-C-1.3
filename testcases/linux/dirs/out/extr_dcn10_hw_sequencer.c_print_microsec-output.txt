Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dcn10_hw_sequencer.c_print_microsec.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential division by zero when `dc_ctx->dc->res_pool->ref_clocks.dchub_ref_clock_inKhz` is 0. The variable `ref_clk_mhz` is derived from this value divided by `1000`, and later used as a divisor in `(ref_cycle * frac) / ref_clk_mhz`. A zero divisor results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Division by zero  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate that `dc_ctx->dc->res_pool->ref_clocks.dchub_ref_clock_inKhz` is non-zero before performing the division. If this value is 0, the program will exhibit undefined behavior and likely crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Before computing `ref_clk_mhz`, add a check to ensure `dc_ctx->dc->res_pool->ref_clocks.dchub_ref_clock_inKhz` is greater than zero. If the value is 0, handle the scenario gracefully (e.g., log an error message or return early). Example:  
```c  
if (dc_ctx->dc->res_pool->ref_clocks.dchub_ref_clock_inKhz == 0) {
    DTN_INFO("Error: dchub_ref_clock_inKhz is zero, cannot compute microseconds.");
    return;
}
```
