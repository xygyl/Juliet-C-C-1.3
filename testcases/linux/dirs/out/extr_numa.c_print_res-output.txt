Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_numa.c_print_res.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential dereference of uninitialized or invalid pointer `g`. Specifically, the function accesses `g->p.show_quiet`, but there is no guarantee in the provided code that the pointer `g` is valid or initialized. Dereferencing an invalid or null pointer results in undefined behavior as per the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `g` is not initialized properly and points to `NULL`, the access of `g->p.show_quiet` will result in a null pointer dereference, causing a runtime crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the global variable `g` is explicitly initialized before invoking this function. For example:
```c
if (g == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: g is uninitialized\n");
    return;
}
```
Alternatively, validate `g`'s initialization outside this function and assert its validity before entering the execution path that calls `print_res`.
