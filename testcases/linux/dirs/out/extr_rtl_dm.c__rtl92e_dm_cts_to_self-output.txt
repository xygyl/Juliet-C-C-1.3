UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The static variables `lastTxOkCnt` and `lastRxOkCnt` are uninitialized. Accessing their values before explicitly initializing them leads to undefined behavior due to reading from uninitialized memory.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Bug, Undefined Behavior Usage
Bug Reason: The use of uninitialized static variables (`lastTxOkCnt` and `lastRxOkCnt`) could cause inconsistent or unpredictable program behavior, affecting the correctness of the logic that calculates `curTxOkCnt` and `curRxOkCnt`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Initialize `lastTxOkCnt` and `lastRxOkCnt` to zero when declared. For example:
```c
static unsigned long lastTxOkCnt = 0;
static unsigned long lastRxOkCnt = 0;
```
