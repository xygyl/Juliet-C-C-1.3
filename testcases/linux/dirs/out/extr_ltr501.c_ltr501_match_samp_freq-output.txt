Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_ltr501.c_ltr501_match_samp_freq.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is potential for integer overflow in the expression `val * 1000000 + val2`. If `val` is particularly large (e.g., surpassing `INT_MAX/1000000`), multiplying it by `1000000` could cause a signed integer overflow, which is categorized as undefined behavior in C.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw / Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The potential for integer overflow can lead to incorrect computation of `freq`, causing the function to behave incorrectly when searching the sample table (`tab`). This may lead to returning an invalid index or failing to find a correct match.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Use an appropriate data type such as `long long int` for `freq` and ensure the multiplication is properly vetted to prevent overflow. Alternatively, validate `val` to ensure it remains within a range that avoids overflow. For example:

```c
if (val > INT_MAX / 1000000) {
    return -EINVAL;
}
freq = val * 1000000 + val2;
```
Or use type widening:

```c
long long freq = (long long)val * 1000000 + val2;
``` 

This ensures the operation remains well-defined and prevents unexpected issues.
