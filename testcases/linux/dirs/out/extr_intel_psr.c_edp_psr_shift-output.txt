Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel_psr.c_edp_psr_shift.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function executes a `MISSING_CASE(cpu_transcoder)` macro, but the behavior of this macro is undefined in the given code. If the macro doesn't have a defined behavior or introduces UB elsewhere (such as trapping or invalid memory access), it constitutes UB in scenarios where `cpu_transcoder` doesn't match any of the defined cases (A, B, C, EDP). Additionally, `enum transcoder` may contain a value beyond the enumerated range, leading to unexpected behavior.  
Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: N/A  
Bug Reason: The logic handles all potential code paths with a default case in the `switch` statement. Even if `cpu_transcoder` doesn't match a defined case, the function defaults to returning `EDP_PSR_TRANSCODER_EDP_SHIFT`. No logic flaw or memory-related bug is observed assuming valid macro definition for `MISSING_CASE`.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `MISSING_CASE(cpu_transcoder)` is implemented in a way that does not cause UB, such as by logging the error to a file, raising a diagnostic message, or deliberately halting execution safely (e.g., through an assert or return value). Also, confirm `enum transcoder` values cannot exceed its defined range during runtime, or handle such cases more robustly (e.g., with input sanitization before the `switch`).
