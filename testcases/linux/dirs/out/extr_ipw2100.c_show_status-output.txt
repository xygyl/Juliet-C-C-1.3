Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_ipw2100.c_show_status.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code casts `p->status`, which is a type `scalar_t__` (defined as `long`), to `int`. This can lead to undefined behavior if `scalar_t__` holds a value outside the valid range for an `int`. The signed integer conversion may result in truncation or an implementation-dependent result.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: Casting the `status` value to an `int` may cause potential loss of information if `scalar_t__` (a `long`) holds a value that does not fit within the smaller range of `int`. This could result in incorrect status representation in `buf` and erroneous output.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Change the cast in `sprintf` to reliably print the `scalar_t__` type as `long`. Use `sprintf(buf, "0x%08lx\n", (long)p->status);` to ensure compatibility with the `scalar_t__` type, which is defined as `long`.
