UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function performs operations on the `priv->config[id]` array without verifying the validity of the `id` parameter, which may cause an out-of-bounds array access if `id` exceeds the allocated bounds for `config`. This results in undefined behavior as accessing an invalid array index is a violation of the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw / Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: There is no explicit check on the `id` parameter to ensure it lies within the bounds of the `config` array. If a caller passes a value of `id` inconsistent with the allocated size of the `config` array, such as accessing indices that do not exist, it results in out-of-bounds memory writes at various points (`priv->config[id].mmcc`, `priv->config[id].spc`, etc.). This can corrupt memory, cause the program to crash, or introduce security vulnerabilities.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before performing any operations on `priv->config[id]`, validate that the `id` parameter is within valid bounds. For example:  
```c
if (id < 0 || id >= MAX_CONFIG_SIZE) {
    return -EINVAL;
}
```  
Here, `MAX_CONFIG_SIZE` should correspond to the actual size of the `config` array. Additionally, ensure that the `config` array is properly allocated and initialized before use.
