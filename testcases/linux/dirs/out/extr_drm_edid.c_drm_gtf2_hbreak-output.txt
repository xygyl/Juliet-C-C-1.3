UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Out-of-bounds array access may occur when `r` points to an invalid region (non-dereferenceable memory or less than 13 bytes) and `r[12]` is accessed. The behavior of the function `drm_for_each_detailed_block` is not guaranteed to ensure that `r` points to valid and dereferenceable memory.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: If `drm_for_each_detailed_block` does not correctly allocate or set `r` (or leaves it pointing to an invalid memory location), accessing `r[12]` could lead to a crash or undefined behavior due to invalid memory dereference. Additionally, there is no check ensuring that the memory region pointed to by `r` has at least 13 bytes available for access.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add validation to ensure `r` is non-NULL and points to a memory region of at least 13 bytes before attempting to dereference `r[12]`. For example:
```c
if (r && r[12]) {
    return r[12] * 2;
}
return 0;
```
