### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason:  
After a detailed analysis of the function, I did not find any operations that violate the C standard or lead to undefined behavior. Here are some specific points considered:
1. No signed integer overflow occurs; the code uses `u32` (unsigned 32-bit integers) where necessary for size calculations and bit manipulations.
2. Pointers are consistently checked for validity where context-sensitive functions are called, such as in `policydb_lookup_compat(p->policyvers)`.
3. Memory is dereferenced only after ensuring the pointers are valid and initialized, like with `p->symtab[i].table->nel`.
4. The function does not perform invalid casts nor access out-of-bounds arrays.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason:  
The function does not account for the possibility of `write_f[i]` being uninitialized or invalid for indices corresponding to `info->sym_num`. The array `write_f` is referenced using `write_f[i]` during the iterative `hashtab_map` call. If the element at `write_f[i]` is unexpectedly invalid or uninitialized, this could lead to unexpected (but defined) behavior during execution.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  

### Fix Suggestion:
To mitigate potential bugs related to the use of `write_f[i]`, add protection by validating `write_f[i]` before passing it to `hashtab_map`. For example:
```c
if (!write_f[i]) {
    pr_err("SELinux: write function array not initialized for index %u\n", i);
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
This ensures that every function pointer in `write_f` is validated before usage and avoids reliance on implicit guarantees. 

### Additional Notes:
The use of other hard-coded constants such as `POLICYDB_STRING` and `POLICYDB_CONFIG_MLS` seems consistently correct. However, runtime interactions may still introduce unexpected bugs, especially if the `policydb` structure or its members are improperly initialized prior to calling this function.
