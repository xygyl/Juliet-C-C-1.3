UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function performs a cast from `scalar_t__ fake_edid_info` (which appears to be a pointer or scalar type) to `struct edid*` without ensuring the validity of the memory layout or alignment. If `fake_edid_info` does not point to a valid memory region of type `struct edid`, dereferencing or accessing this pointer would result in undefined behavior, violating strict aliasing rules or causing misaligned memory access.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: `ctx->raw_edid` may incorrectly point to invalid memory if `fake_edid_info` does not contain accurate EDID data. This assignment assumes that `fake_edid_info` is always a valid EDID pointer, without verification. If it is not, subsequent access to `ctx->raw_edid` could result in crashes or incorrect behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate `fake_edid_info` before assigning it to `ctx->raw_edid`, ensuring it points to a valid memory region of type `struct edid`. Alternatively, check alignment and ensure the type compatibility before using the pointer. For example:  
```c
if (fake_edid_info && is_valid_edid((struct edid *)fake_edid_info)) {
    ctx->raw_edid = (struct edid *)fake_edid_info;
} else {
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
