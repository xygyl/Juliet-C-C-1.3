UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `sprintf` function writes output to the `page` buffer, but the size and bounds of `page` are never verified, which can result in a buffer overflow if the `page` buffer is not large enough to hold the formatted string. This constitutes undefined behavior as per the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: If the `page` buffer is too small to fit the formatted string, the program may overwrite adjacent memory, corrupting data or causing crashes. Such buffer overflows can also lead to security vulnerabilities.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Use `snprintf` instead of `sprintf`, and verify the buffer size before formatting to ensure it doesn't exceed the buffer capacity.  
2. For instance, you might declare the size of `page` and use `snprintf(page, BUFFER_LIMIT, ...)` where `BUFFER_LIMIT` is the fixed size allocated for the buffer.
