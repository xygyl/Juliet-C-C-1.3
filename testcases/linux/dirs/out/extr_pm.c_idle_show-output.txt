Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pm.c_idle_show.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The type of `enable_dyn_sleep` is unspecified in this code snippet. If `enable_dyn_sleep` is not of the appropriate type (e.g., `unsigned short` for `%hu` in the format string), it leads to undefined behavior because `sprintf` expects a specific type matched by the format specifier.  

Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: N/A  
Bug Reason: Assuming `enable_dyn_sleep` is assigned and its type matches the format specifier `%hu`, no logic or memory-related bugs are evident in the function as provided.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `enable_dyn_sleep` is properly declared as an `unsigned short` or explicitly cast it to `unsigned short` when passing it to `sprintf` to prevent potential mismatch. Example: `sprintf(buf, "%hu\n", (unsigned short)enable_dyn_sleep);`
