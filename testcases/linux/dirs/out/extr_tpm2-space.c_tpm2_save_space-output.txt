Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_tpm2-space.c_tpm2_save_space.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The expression `~space->context_tbl[i]` (bitwise NOT applied to a pointer type) exhibits undefined behavior because `~` is only valid for integral types. Applying it to pointer types violates the standard. This is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The use of `~space->context_tbl[i]` as an integral condition is incorrect and leads to nonsensical logic when pointers are involved. This may result in the incorrect evaluation of `space->context_tbl[i]` values and incorrect program behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: 
Change the condition `if (!(space->context_tbl[i] && ~space->context_tbl[i]))` to a more meaningful expression that explicitly checks the validity of the pointer. For example:
```c
if (space->context_tbl[i] != NULL)
  ...
```
Also remove the statement `space->context_tbl[i] = ~0;` as it does not make logical sense to assign the bitwise NOT value to a pointer type.

Finally, consider introducing stricter checks for valid allocation states of pointers within `context_tbl` and `session_tbl`.
