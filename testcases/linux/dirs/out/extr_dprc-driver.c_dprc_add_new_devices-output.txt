### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function assumes that `strlen(obj_desc->type)` will work correctly without addressing the possibility of `obj_desc->type` being a null pointer. If `obj_desc->type` is null, calling `strlen()` leads to undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer. The C standard defines this as undefined behavior.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: In the line `if (strlen(obj_desc->type) == 0)`, there is no check to ensure that `obj_desc->type` is not `NULL` before calling `strlen()`. If `obj_desc->type` is `NULL`, this will trigger a null pointer dereference.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Add a null pointer check before calling `strlen()`:
```c
if (obj_desc->type == NULL || strlen(obj_desc->type) == 0)
    continue;
```
This ensures that attempting to compute the length of a null pointer is avoided, eliminating both the undefined behavior and associated bug.
