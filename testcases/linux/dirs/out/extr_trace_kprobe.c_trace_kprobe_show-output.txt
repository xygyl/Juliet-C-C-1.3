UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential dereference of null pointer `tk->rp.kp.addr` when `tk->symbol` is not set. The code does not check whether `tk->rp.kp.addr` is valid before using it in `seq_printf(m, " 0x%p", tk->rp.kp.addr);`. Dereferencing a null pointer leads to undefined behavior according to the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: When `tk->symbol` is not set, the code assumes `tk->rp.kp.addr` contains a valid address. If it is null, this results in a null pointer dereference in `seq_printf(m, " 0x%p", tk->rp.kp.addr);`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `tk->rp.kp.addr` is not null before using it. For example:  
```c
if (!tk->symbol) {
    if (tk->rp.kp.addr)
        seq_printf(m, " 0x%p", tk->rp.kp.addr);
    else
        seq_printf(m, " <invalid address>");
}
```
