UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function invokes the `WARN_ON(offset > buf_size)` macro, which typically logs a warning but does not halt execution. This means the computation `buf + offset` and `buf_size - offset` could still proceed even when `offset > buf_size`. This could lead to undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds memory access with pointer arithmetic because `buf + offset` may access invalid memory locations.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: If `offset > buf_size`, the pointer arithmetic `buf + offset` and calculations using `buf_size - offset` could result in a buffer overflow when calling `scnprintf()`. This can corrupt memory and create potential security vulnerabilities.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before performing pointer arithmetic or calling `scnprintf`, explicitly check if `offset > buf_size` and return an error (such as -EINVAL) without proceeding further to ensure safe memory handling. Example fix:  
```c
if (offset > buf_size) {
    WARN_ON(1); // Or preferably log the warning message without macro
    return -EINVAL; // Signal invalid input parameters
}
```
