Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pkey_api.c_pkey_apqns4key.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If the `keylen` provided by the caller is less than the required size of the respective key structure (`struct secaeskeytoken` or `struct cipherkeytoken`), accessing fields like `hdr->version`, `t->mkvp`, or `t->mkvp0` leads to a buffer over-read, resulting in undefined behavior. Furthermore, the cast of the `key` pointer to specific token types assumes proper layout and alignment, which can result in UB if the assumption does not hold.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Over-read
Bug Reason: The function assumes `keylen` is sufficiently large to accommodate different key structures (`struct keytoken_header`, `struct secaeskeytoken`, and `struct cipherkeytoken`). However, the `keylen` check only validates the size against `struct keytoken_header`. Larger structures are accessed without further validation.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add detailed validation of `keylen` before accessing fields specific to `struct secaeskeytoken` or `struct cipherkeytoken`. Ensure alignment requirements are also verified.

Example fix:
```c
if (hdr->version == TOKVER_CCA_AES) {
    if (keylen < sizeof(struct secaeskeytoken)) return -EINVAL;
    struct secaeskeytoken *t = (struct secaeskeytoken *)key;
    ...
} else if (hdr->version == TOKVER_CCA_VLSC) {
    if (keylen < sizeof(struct cipherkeytoken)) return -EINVAL;
    struct cipherkeytoken *t = (struct cipherkeytoken *)key;
    ...
}
```
