### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain any clear undefined behavior based on the C standard.  
- Input data is properly used in terms of reading and writing values.  
- No invalid memory accesses, division, or pointer dereferencing are observed.  
- The switch statement appears valid even with the use of a `default` case.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: There's an incorrect handling in the switch statement when `ant->rx` is `ANTENNA_B`. The code sets both `r77` and `r4` fields assuming `ANTENNA_B` as the default case, which may cause conflicting configurations if `ant->rx` isn't explicitly an invalid value but is unexpectedly set to another value. This logic flaw could result in inconsistent antenna behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Separate the `case ANTENNA_B` logic from the `default` block. Ensure the default case explicitly handles unexpected antenna configurations with appropriate error handling or a no-op/fallback state.
