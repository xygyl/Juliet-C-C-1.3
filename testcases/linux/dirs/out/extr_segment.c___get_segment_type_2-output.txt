UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If the `fio` pointer passed to the function is NULL, dereferencing `fio->type` leads to undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not check if the `fio` pointer is NULL before dereferencing it, leading to a potential null pointer dereference if it is invalid.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check at the start of the function to ensure that `fio` is valid before attempting to dereference it. For example:  
```c  
if (fio == NULL)  
    return -1; // Or handle the error appropriately.  
```
