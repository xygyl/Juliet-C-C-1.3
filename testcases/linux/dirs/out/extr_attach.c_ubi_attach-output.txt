**UB Analysis**  
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit any clear undefined behavior according to the C standard. Memory allocation, pointer dereferencing, and arithmetic operations appear valid and well-protected by error-handling mechanisms. Also, integer-to-pointer manipulation or other forms of undefined pointer behavior are absent. The function interacts with memory carefully and checks results (e.g., ensuring `alloc_ai()` and `scan_*` functions return valid results). Variables are either initialized explicitly or retrieved from function calls.

**Bug Analysis**  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason:  
- The logic handling fastmap scanning (`scan_fast`) and falling back to a full scan (`scan_all`) can result in inconsistency. Specifically:
  1. If `scan_fast` fails (`err > 0 || mtd_is_eccerr(err)`), the function retries `scan_all`, but depending on the error (`UBI_NO_FASTMAP` vs. other errors), different modes of `scan_all` can be triggered.
  2. If `force_scan` overrides initially, it may lead to an unnecessary or redundant fallback logic, causing inefficiency rather than outright failure.
  3. The handling of fastmap-related variables such as `ubi->fm_disabled` and `ubi->fm` is unclear in edge cases where fastmap is disabled yet the scan mode toggles dynamically.

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  

**Fix Suggestion**  
1. Clarify and streamline the fallback logic between `scan_fast` and `scan_all`. Ensure conditions and modes (e.g., `UBI_FM_MAX_START` vs. normal `scan_all`) are explicitly defined and avoid redundant branching.
2. Add clearer guarantees about the `fm_disabled` and `fm` flags to ensure consistency with scan modes, especially when `force_scan` is used. Possibly decouple these modes.
