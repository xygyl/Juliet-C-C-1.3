UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The behavior of shifting `val` by 6 bits (`val >> 6`) could lead to undefined behavior if the value of `val` is such that the result of the operation exceeds the size of the uint32_t type or if `val` is large and the left bit manipulation causes an undefined result during extraction due to excessive computation positions beyond operand limits.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Invalid memory access.  
Bug Reason: Improper control over routine calculation may violate logical integrity of the software.  
Bug Caused by UB:
