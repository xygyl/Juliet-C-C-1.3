Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_venc.c_venc_start_streaming.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code uses `mutex_unlock()` without ensuring that the corresponding `mutex_lock()` happened successfully before. If the `lock` in `struct venus_inst` is uninitialized or corrupted, this could lead to undefined behavior. Also, integer operations on `inst->sequence_cap` or `inst->sequence_out` implicitly depend on uninitialized values if `venus_inst` is improperly initialized.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The function `venus_helper_init_instance()` is called assuming `inst` has been properly initialized elsewhere. If `venus_inst` hasn't been correctly initialized, dereferencing its members (e.g., `lock`) or modifying them (e.g., `sequence_cap`) can lead to unexpected behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `struct venus_inst *inst` and its members (e.g., `lock`) are properly initialized before `venc_start_streaming()` is called. Additionally, add sanity checks for `mutex_lock()` and `mutex_unlock()` to ensure they are working on a valid mutex object.
