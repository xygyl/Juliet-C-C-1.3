UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing an undefined memory region through __raw_readl or __raw_writel may cause undefined behavior. These functions presumably work with hardware registers, but without context or validation on `PM_SOFT_RST_REG` (such as address validity), dereferencing it in `__raw_readl(PM_SOFT_RST_REG)` or `__raw_writel(value, PM_SOFT_RST_REG)` could lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, the function contains dependent operations related to hardware registers, and the validity of `PM_SOFT_RST_REG` is not established.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The conditional logic in this function evaluates whether certain bits in the `block` parameter are set. However, if `block` contains conflicting bits (e.g., both evaluated by `block & 0x30000001` and `block & PM_SOFT_RST_REG_MASK`), the behavior might lead to unintended register modifications. This could cause issues while interacting with hardware.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion:
1. Validate the `PM_SOFT_RST_REG` address to ensure it's safe and properly mapped before accessing it via `__raw_readl` or `__raw_writel`.
2. Add robust sanity checks for the `block` parameter to clarify the context in which bits are being evaluated and prevent conflicting or undefined operations.
3. Provide detailed comments documenting the expected structure and purpose of `block` and its relation to `PM_SOFT_RST_REG_MASK`. This will avoid future misuse/misinterpretation.
