### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function assumes that `muxc` and the value returned by `i2c_mux_priv(muxc)` are valid pointers. If `muxc` or `mux` is `NULL`, dereferencing these pointers (`mux->do_not_deselect` or `mux->control`) would result in undefined behavior. Additionally, there is no check in the function to validate the return value of `i2c_mux_priv(muxc)`. If `mux` is an invalid pointer, this could lead to UB when attempting to access its fields.  
Confidence: High

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: The function doesn't check if `muxc` received as a parameter is `NULL`, nor does it verify that `mux` (obtained via `i2c_mux_priv`) is a valid pointer. A NULL or invalid pointer would cause a crash if dereferenced.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
Add checks to ensure that `muxc` is not `NULL` and that the result of `i2c_mux_priv(muxc)` is a valid pointer before accessing any fields. For example:
```c
static int i2c_mux_deselect(struct i2c_mux_core *muxc, u32 chan)
{
    if (!muxc)
        return -EINVAL; // Return an invalid argument error

    struct mux *mux = i2c_mux_priv(muxc);
    if (!mux)
        return -EINVAL;

    if (mux->do_not_deselect)
        return 0;

    return mux_control_deselect(mux->control);
}
```
Here, `-EINVAL` ensures a proper error code is returned for invalid input instead of triggering undefined behavior.
