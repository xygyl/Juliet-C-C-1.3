UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `rq_list` pointer is dereferenced without confirmation that it has been properly initialized. If `kcq->rq_list` is `NULL` or points to invalid memory, dereferencing it with `INIT_LIST_HEAD()` will cause undefined behavior as it accesses memory that may not be valid.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `kcq->rq_list` is set to `NULL` or points to an invalid memory location, the dereference in `INIT_LIST_HEAD(&kcq->rq_list[i])` could lead to a crash or undefined program behavior. There is no check for the validity of `rq_list`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Verify that `kcq->rq_list` points to a valid memory location or has been properly allocated before attempting to dereference it in the loop. Alternatively, if `rq_list` should always hold a valid pointer when passed to this function, ensure this is guaranteed by external initialization logic. For example:
```c
if (kcq->rq_list == NULL) {
    // Handle error or initialize `rq_list` properly
}
```
Alternatively, ensure `kcq->rq_list` is properly allocated before calling `kyber_ctx_queue_init()`.
