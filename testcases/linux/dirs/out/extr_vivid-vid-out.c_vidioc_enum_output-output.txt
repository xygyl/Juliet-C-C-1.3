Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vivid-vid-out.c_vidioc_enum_output.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `sizeof(out->name)` is used inside the `snprintf` function, but `out->name` is declared as `int name;` in `struct v4l2_output`. This leads to incorrect size calculations, as `sizeof(out->name)` returns the size of an `int` instead of the actual intended buffer size for the name string, and `snprintf` could potentially write beyond the memory bounds allocated for `out->name`. This results in undefined behavior due to buffer overflow.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The inappropriate use of `sizeof(out->name)` in the `snprintf` function makes it possible for the function to write past the end of the memory allocated for `out->name`. This can corrupt adjacent memory and lead to crashes or incorrect program behavior.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `out->name` is properly declared as an array with sufficient size to hold the formatted strings (e.g., `char name[32];`), and use its size explicitly in the `snprintf` function instead of relying on `sizeof(out->name)`.

Example fix:
```c
// Fix struct declaration
struct v4l2_output {
    size_t index;
    int audioset;
    int capabilities;
    char name[32]; // Use a fixed-size array for the name
    int std;
    int type;
};

// Use the corrected size in snprintf
snprintf(out->name, sizeof(out->name), "S-Video %u", dev->output_name_counter[out->index]);
```
