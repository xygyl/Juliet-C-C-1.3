UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior due to type aliasing violations when casting `vc->vc_pos` (a `scalar_t__`) to `(u16 *)`. The C standard prohibits accessing an object through a pointer of an incompatible type, which may trigger undefined behavior per strict aliasing rules. Additionally, the leftward shift operation on `type >> 8` poses a risk if `type` is smaller than expected, as no validation checks prevent exceeding the type boundaries (e.g., shift width being greater than the bit-width).  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: There is a flaw in the logic handling `type` and `softcursor_original`: If `softcursor_original` is -1 (as it appears to be initialized), the function refrains from updating it even though this case is likely necessary to ensure the proper behavior of the soft cursor. As a result, the intended functionality—especially when `softcursor_original` starts uninitialized—may be incorrect.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
- Resolve the strict aliasing issue by using either a union for type aliasing or an appropriately typed pointer. Change the casting of `vc->vc_pos` from `(u16 *)` to a proper wrapper function that adheres to alignment and aliasing rules.  
- Validate the `type` variable before performing any shift operations, ensuring shifts align with the bit-width of the type being manipulated.  
- Add explicit handling for cases where `softcursor_original == -1` to ensure that the logic behaves as intended under initialization scenarios.
