Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_checks.c_check_avoid_default_addr_size.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing `node->parent->addr_cells` or `node->parent->size_cells` when `node->parent` could potentially be `NULL`. This results in undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: `node->parent` is not validated before accessing its fields (`addr_cells` and `size_cells`). If `node->parent` is `NULL`, this could lead to a program crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to confirm that `node->parent` is not `NULL` before accessing `node->parent->addr_cells` and `node->parent->size_cells`. For example:
```c
if (node->parent && node->parent->addr_cells == -1)
    FAIL(c, dti, node, "Relying on default #address-cells value");

if (node->parent && node->parent->size_cells == -1)
    FAIL(c, dti, node, "Relying on default #size-cells value");
```
