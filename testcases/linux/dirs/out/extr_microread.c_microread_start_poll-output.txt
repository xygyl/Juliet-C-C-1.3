### UB Analysis

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The line where `hdev->gb` is dereferenced (`hdev->gb, hdev->gb_len`) in calls to `nfc_hci_set_param` might invoke undefined behavior because the check `if (hdev->gb == NULL || hdev->gb_len == 0)` only clears `im_protocols` and `tm_protocols` but does not prevent subsequent usage of a potentially `NULL` `hdev->gb` pointer. If `im_protocols` or `tm_protocols` still allow the `NFC_PROTO_NFC_DEP_MASK` bit from being considered, this would lead to dereferencing a `NULL` pointer.  

### Bug Analysis

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: As mentioned above, `hdev->gb` could be dereferenced despite it possibly being `NULL`. The failed condition does not prevent subsequent code that relies on the validity of `hdev->gb`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion  
Before using `hdev->gb` later in the function (e.g., inside the block conditioned on `im_protocols & NFC_PROTO_NFC_DEP_MASK` or `tm_protocols & NFC_PROTO_NFC_DEP_MASK`), there must be an additional check to ensure `hdev->gb != NULL`. If it is `NULL`, the function should return an error or avoid those operations entirely. Specifically, add a `return` after clearing `im_protocols` and `tm_protocols`, or modify the branches to skip behavior related to potentially `NULL` `hdev->gb`.
