Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_wm8776.c_wm8776_probe.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `component` pointer is dereferenced without a null check before being passed to the `wm8776_reset()` function or `snd_soc_component_update_bits()` calls. If `component` is null, dereferencing `component->dev` or passing `component` as an argument would result in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If the `component` pointer is null, the function would attempt to dereference it, leading to a runtime crash. A proper null check is missing before the call to `wm8776_reset()` or the use of `component->dev`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `component` at the beginning of the function:

```c
if (!component) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return a suitable error code
}
```

Alternatively, the caller must ensure that `component` is not null before invoking this function.
