UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential usage of the `abs()` function with `scalar_t__`, which is defined as `long`. The standard `abs()` function in C is intended for `int` types and may lead to undefined behavior or inaccurate results when applied to long types.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: Incorrect use of `abs()` to compute differences in width. The provided value might result in inaccurate computation in edge cases given its incorrect usage.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use the `labs()` function (which is designed for `long` types) instead of `abs()` to remove undefined behavior and ensure accurate calculations. Modify the problematic line as follows:
```c
|| (labs(fmtd->fmt.pix.width - stk_sizes[i-1].w) < labs(fmtd->fmt.pix.width - stk_sizes[i].w))
```
