Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vega10_hwmgr.c_vega10_setup_default_single_dpm_table.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds access. The code assumes `dpm_table->dpm_levels` has sufficient space to accommodate `dpm_table->count` index, but no bounds check is performed to verify if accessing `dpm_levels[dpm_table->count]` is safe. This may cause undefined behavior if the `dpm_levels` array does not have sufficient capacity.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The function could write past the allocated memory in `dpm_table->dpm_levels` if `dep_table->count` exceeds the allocated size of `dpm_table->dpm_levels`. This is not verified in the code, leading to the possibility of memory corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check to ensure `dpm_table->count` does not exceed the allocated size of `dpm_table->dpm_levels`. For example:
```c
if (dpm_table->count >= MAX_DPM_LEVELS) {  // Assuming MAX_DPM_LEVELS is defined as the maximum size
    break;
}
```
Alternatively, ensure the size of `dpm_table->dpm_levels` is dynamically allocated based on `dep_table->count` before the loop to guarantee safety during writes.
