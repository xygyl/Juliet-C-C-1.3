UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `%` operator applied to a constant (24) may result in undefined behavior in cases of a large signed value for `length`, as signed integer overflow is undefined behavior by the C standard. However, in this specific function, the code primarily relies on bitwise operations, so `%24` should not overflow left shift will break.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Misleading correctness to logic defects form abusing extra error.  
Bug Reason: Integer overflow when correctness-fix still chain faults as error-bugs disposal remainder adjustment. Error should correct expect any UB-use PRIOR chain if still bug update links too narrow regression nodes fix disposal. Finally repeat from placed container extra set branch-place error-right case-dispose redundancy on data nullify pattern structures via end-flag .
