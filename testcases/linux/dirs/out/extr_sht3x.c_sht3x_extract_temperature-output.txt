Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sht3x.c_sht3x_extract_temperature.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow is possible during `21875 * (int)raw` if `raw` takes a value sufficiently large, as signed integer overflow is undefined behavior in C.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The multiplication `21875 * (int)raw` could cause an integer overflow if `raw` is large enough (close to its maximum value for `u16`, which is 65535). Although this results in UB, it would manifest as incorrect temperature calculation.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Use a larger integer type for the intermediate calculation to avoid overflow, such as `long long` or explicitly cast to `unsigned long long`.  

Modified code:  
```c
#include <stdint.h>  // Include for fixed-size integers like uint64_t

static int sht3x_extract_temperature(u16 raw) {
    return ((21875ULL * raw) >> 13) - 45000;
}
```  
This ensures that the multiplication does not overflow because `21875ULL * raw` will be computed as an `unsigned long long` (64 bits on most platforms).
