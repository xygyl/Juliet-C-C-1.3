UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The dereference of `info->par` assumes that `info` and `info->par` are non-NULL without performing any explicit null checks. If `info` or `info->par` are NULL when this function is invoked, dereferencing `info->par` results in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The lack of null checks for `info` and `info->par` could lead to a null pointer dereference if they are unexpectedly NULL at runtime.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit null checks for `info` and `info->par` at the start of the function to ensure they are non-NULL before proceeding with dereferencing. For example:
```c
if (!info || !info->par) {
    return;
}
```
