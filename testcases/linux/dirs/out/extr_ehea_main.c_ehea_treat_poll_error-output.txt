UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function assumes that `get_skb_by_index()` returns a valid pointer for `skb`, but it does not verify if its return value is NULL or invalid. Dereferencing a NULL `skb` in the subsequent `dev_kfree_skb(skb)` call causes undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: If `get_skb_by_index()` returns NULL for any reason, dereferencing this pointer via `dev_kfree_skb(skb)` leads to a null pointer dereference, which is a logic bug. Additionally, there is a lack of validation for the return value of `get_skb_by_index()`, which violates defensive programming principles.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null-check for the return value of `get_skb_by_index()`. For example:  
```c
if (skb) {
    dev_kfree_skb(skb);
} else {
    pr_err("Failed to retrieve skb from index.\n");
}
```
