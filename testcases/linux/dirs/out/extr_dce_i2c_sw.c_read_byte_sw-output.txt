Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dce_i2c_sw.c_read_byte_sw.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: **Signed integer shift beyond valid range (undefined behavior).** Shifting a signed integer, `int32_t shift`, negatively below its defined range (e.g., `shift >= 0` check and internal looping decrement may violate UB). Also bytes worse "loads gaps systems given on UB standard kernel unclear lies few [test-related] nature structs clock_delay_div4, clients device".  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory I/O  
Bug Reason Mutex/more unattempted - struct through APIs high SCL internal scratches concurrent parallel where, requisite. x
