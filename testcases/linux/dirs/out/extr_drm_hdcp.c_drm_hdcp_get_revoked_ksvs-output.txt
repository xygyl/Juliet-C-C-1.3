UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function contains a potential out-of-bounds memory access issue caused by reading values from `buf` without checking its length against `vrls_length`. Specifically, the code does not validate whether `buf` has enough bytes left for `vrl_ksv_cnt` and `vrl_ksv_sz` calculations, or even `buf++`, which leads to undefined behavior when `buf` points beyond the allocated buffer length.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Memory Access  
Bug Reason: The `do-while` loop iterates and performs memory access operations using `buf`, but it does not verify whether `parsed_bytes + (vrl_ksv_sz + 1)` exceeds the `vrls_length`. If `vrl_ksv_sz + 1 > vrls_length - parsed_bytes`, the loop will cause read/write operations on invalid memory, resulting in undefined behavior and a potential security vulnerability.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Before executing `buf++` or `memcpy(revoked_ksv_list, buf, vrl_ksv_sz)`, add proper boundary checks to ensure that `buf` will not read or write outside the bounds of the input buffer:
```c
if (parsed_bytes + (vrl_ksv_sz + 1) > vrls_length) {
    // Handle error: buffer size exceeded
    return ksv_count; // or another error handling mechanism
}
```  
Alternatively, perform bounds checks before entering the body of the loop:
```c
while (parsed_bytes < vrls_length) {
    if (parsed_bytes + DRM_HDCP_KSV_LEN + 1 > vrls_length) {
        break; // prevent buffer overflow
    }
    // Continue normal logic...
}
```  
This ensures the function only accesses valid memory within the bounds of `vrls_length`.
