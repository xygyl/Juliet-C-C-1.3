Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_lp8788-charger.c_lp8788_show_eoc_level.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing an out-of-bounds index in the `abs_level` or `relative_level` arrays can occur if `val` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in these arrays (4 elements). The array index `val` is derived from the `LP8788_CHG_EOC_LEVEL_M` mask, but the mask does not guarantee that `val` is within the valid range of [0, 3]. Undefined behavior would occur if an out-of-bounds index is accessed in either array.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow (Out-of-Bounds Array Access)
Bug Reason: The function does not validate `val` after bit-shifting and masking to ensure it is within the valid range of indices for the `abs_level` or `relative_level` arrays. If `val` is out of range, an out-of-bounds read on the arrays will occur, causing memory corruption or program crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add validation for the computed `val` before accessing the arrays. For instance:
```c
if (val >= 4) {
    return scnprintf(buf, PAGE_SIZE, "Invalid End Of Charge Level\n");
}
```
This ensures that `val` always falls within the valid range of [0, 3], preventing out-of-bounds array access.
