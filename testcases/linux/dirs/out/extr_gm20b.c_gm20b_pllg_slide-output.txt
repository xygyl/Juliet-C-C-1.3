UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses `udelay(1)`, which is a delay function that may invoke undefined behavior if external timing constraints and interruptions (hardware restrictions) are not properly adhered to. Within a general static context, however, the operation itself is valid unless underlying assumptions break.
Additionally, potential undefined behavior can arise due to type widening improperly affecting large values in `sdm_din << GPCPLL_CFG2_SDM_DIN_SHIFT` ** Having Silence-guid-another question estimate**.
