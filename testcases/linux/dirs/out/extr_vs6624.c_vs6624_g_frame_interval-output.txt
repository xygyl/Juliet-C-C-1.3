Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vs6624.c_vs6624_g_frame_interval.c

UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit any undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. Variables are accessed correctly, and there are no violations of strict aliasing rules, no null dereference, no uninitialized variables, and no signed integer overflow.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: It appears that the numerator and denominator values from `sensor->frame_rate` are swapped when assigned to `ival->interval`. This inversion likely defeats the intended functionality of the frame interval computation because typically, intervals are represented as `numerator/denominator`. The swap suggests that the frame rate might be misrepresented.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Swap the numerator and denominator assignment to the correct order:
```c
ival->interval.numerator = sensor->frame_rate.numerator;
ival->interval.denominator = sensor->frame_rate.denominator;
```
