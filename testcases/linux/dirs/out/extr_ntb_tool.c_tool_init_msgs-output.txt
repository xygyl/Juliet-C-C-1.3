### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The code does not exhibit undefined behavior based on the given context. All memory allocations are done using `devm_kcalloc`, which checks for allocation failures. Loop counters and variables are properly initialized. No null pointer dereferencing or violations of the C standard are evident.

### Bug Analysis  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory allocation failure handling  
Bug Reason: While the function properly checks for allocation failures, it returns a generic error code `-ENOMEM` without cleaning up previously allocated resources. Specifically, if an allocation for `tc->peers[pidx].outmsgs` fails, memory allocated for `tc->inmsgs` earlier in the function is leaked. This creates potential for a memory leak if subsequent allocations fail. Furthermore, the function assumes `peer_cnt > 0` but does not validate this assumption, which may lead to issues if `peer_cnt == 0`.

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
1. Add proper cleanup logic for previously allocated memory in case of allocation failures. For example:
```c
for (int i = 0; i < pidx; i++) {
    if (tc->peers[i].outmsgs)
        devm_kfree(&tc->ntb->dev, tc->peers[i].outmsgs);
}
if (tc->inmsgs)
    devm_kfree(&tc->ntb->dev, tc->inmsgs);
```

2. Validate `tc->peer_cnt` at the start of the function to ensure it is greater than 0:
```c
if (tc->peer_cnt <= 0)
    return -EINVAL;  // Invalid argument
```

Implementing these changes would make the function more robust and prevent resource leaks.
