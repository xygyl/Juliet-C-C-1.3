Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cipher.c_ahash_hmac_digest.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The variable `rctx->total_todo` is used before being initialized. The addition `rctx->total_todo += blocksize;` assumes `rctx->total_todo` already has a valid value. If it is uninitialized, this operation leads to undefined behavior since accessing an uninitialized variable is not defined by the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Initialization Bug  
Bug Reason: As `rctx->total_todo` is uninitialized, its value at the time of `rctx->total_todo += blocksize;` is unknown, which could lead to unintended logic or incorrect computations later. It may cause incorrect hash processing or memory corruption depending on its eventual value.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Ensure `rctx->total_todo` is properly initialized to a known value (e.g., `0`) before being incremented. This can be achieved by adding a line at the start of the function:  
```c  
rctx->total_todo = 0;  
```
