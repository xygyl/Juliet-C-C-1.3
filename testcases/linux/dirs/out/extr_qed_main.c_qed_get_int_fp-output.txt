### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The usage of the `memset(info, 0, sizeof(struct qed_int_info))` function could lead to undefined behavior if `info` is `NULL`. This is undefined behavior because `memset` doesn't check for `NULL`, and calling it with a `NULL` pointer causes a memory access violation.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If the caller of `qed_get_int_fp` provides a `NULL` pointer for `info`, the `memset` operation will attempt to write to invalid memory, causing a crash or undefined behavior. This potential issue is not explicitly handled within the function. Additionally, the function does not check for `NULL` in `cdev` before dereferencing it to access `cdev->int_params`. If `cdev` is `NULL`, dereferencing it would cause a segmentation fault or similar error.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
- Add explicit checks for `NULL` before dereferencing pointers:
  ```c
  if (!info) {
      DP_INFO(cdev, "Null pointer provided for info\n");
      return -EINVAL;
  }
  if (!cdev) {
      DP_INFO(cdev, "Null pointer provided for cdev\n");
      return -EINVAL;
  }
  ```

- The above adjustment ensures that the function gracefully handles invalid `NULL` input, avoiding undefined behavior and runtime crashes.
