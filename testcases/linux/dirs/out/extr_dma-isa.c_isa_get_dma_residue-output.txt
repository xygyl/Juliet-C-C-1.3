Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dma-isa.c_isa_get_dma_residue.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function attempts to index into `isa_dma_port` using `chan`, but it does not validate whether `chan` falls within the bounds of the `isa_dma_port` array. If `chan` is greater than the size of the array, this results in out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior in C.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: Similar to the UB reason, an out-of-bounds array access occurs when `chan` is not properly validated against the bounds of `isa_dma_port`. This can cause memory corruption or runtime crashes.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a boundary check at the beginning of the function to ensure that `chan` is within the valid range of indices for `isa_dma_port`. For example:

```c
if (chan >= /* size of isa_dma_port */) {
    return -EINVAL; // or another appropriate error code.
}
```
