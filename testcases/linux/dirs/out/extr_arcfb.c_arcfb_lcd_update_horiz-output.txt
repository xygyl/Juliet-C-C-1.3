UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses a macro `ceil64` which is likely a mathematical operation. However, its semantics are unclear because it is applied in a way that might result in undefined behavior depending on its implementation. If `ceil64` uses invalid memory access, performs integer division by zero, or invokes a function with side effects improperly, this could lead to UB. `lower` can be initialized and prone to pointer log bugs object.
