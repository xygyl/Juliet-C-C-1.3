Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_bus.c_amba_aphb_device_add.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Possible out-of-bounds access in `dev->irq[1]`. The code assumes that `dev->irq` is an array of at least two elements (`irq[0]` and `irq[1]`) without verifying its size.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related bug
Bug Reason: If `dev->irq` is smaller than two elements, writing to `dev->irq[1]` results in a potential buffer overflow, corrupting memory.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before assigning values to `dev->irq[0]` and `dev->irq[1]`, validate that `amba_device_alloc()` allocates an `amba_device` structure where `irq` has at least two valid indices. Alternatively, add bounds checks on the size of `irq`.
