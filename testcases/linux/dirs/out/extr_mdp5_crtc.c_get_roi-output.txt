### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: 
1. **Signed Integer Overflow**: The `abs()` function operates on signed integers and can lead to undefined behavior if its argument is `INT_MIN`, as the negation of `INT_MIN` exceeds the range of valid signed integers.
2. **Potential NULL Pointer Dereference**: While there is no explicit evidence that `crtc` or `mdp5_crtc` are guaranteed non-NULL, the presence of dereferencing (`crtc->mode.hdisplay`, etc.) could result in undefined behavior if these pointers are NULL.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: 
1. **Signed Integer Overflow**  
2. **Logic Flaw**  

Bug Reason: 
1. For the case of `mdp5_crtc->cursor.x < 0` or `mdp5_crtc->cursor.y < 0`, the use of `abs()` could lead to undefined behavior if the value is `INT_MIN`. The resulting subtraction (`cursor.width - abs(cursor.x)` or `cursor.height - abs(cursor.y)`) may incorrectly calculate the ROI dimensions due to this overflow.
2. The function does not check the validity of the `crtc` pointer before dereferencing it, creating a risk of segmentation faults or invalid memory access in cases where `crtc` is NULL.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Validate the pointers (`crtc` and `mdp5_crtc`) before use:
   ```c
   if (!crtc || !mdp5_crtc) {
       *roi_w = 0;
       *roi_h = 0;
       return;
   }
   ```

2. Use a safer approach to handle absolute values to avoid signed integer overflow:
   ```c
   uint32_t signed_abs(int32_t value) {
       return (uint32_t)((value < 0) ? -((int64_t)value) : value);
   }
   ```
   Replace calls to `abs()` with `signed_abs()`.

3. Consider bounds checking to ensure the results never exceed display dimensions or become negative. Add safeguards to crop correctly even in edge cases.
