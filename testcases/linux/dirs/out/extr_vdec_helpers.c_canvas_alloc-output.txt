Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vdec_helpers.c_canvas_alloc.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential array out-of-bounds access in `sess->canvas_alloc[sess->canvas_num++]`. If `sess->canvas_num` is equal to or exceeds `MAX_CANVAS`, no bounds check occurs here before incrementing the index (`sess->canvas_num++`). This violates safe bounds compliance.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw / Potential Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The function does not adequately prevent writing to the `canvas_alloc` array at invalid indices. If `sess->canvas_num` is greater than or equal to `MAX_CANVAS`, the loop checks only in the condition above but does nothing to limit the subsequent write operation (increment causes out-of-bounds write).
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a strict bounds check for `sess->canvas_num < MAX_CANVAS` before updating `canvas_alloc`. For example:
```c
if (sess->canvas_num < MAX_CANVAS) {
    sess->canvas_alloc[sess->canvas_num++] = *canvas_id;
    return 0;
} else {
    dev_err(sess->core->dev, "Reached max number of canvas\n");
    return -ENOMEM;
}
```
