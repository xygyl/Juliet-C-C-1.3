UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: This function accesses `chan->indio_dev->info` without properly validating if `chan` or `chan->indio_dev` is a valid pointer. Dereferencing null or invalid pointers is undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `chan` or `chan->indio_dev` is NULL, attempting to access `chan->indio_dev->info_exist_lock` and `chan->indio_dev->info` will cause a null pointer dereference. The function assumes these pointers are valid without checking.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add validation for `chan` and `chan->indio_dev` at the beginning of the function:  
```c
if (!chan || !chan->indio_dev) {
    return -ENODEV;
}
```  
This ensures the pointers are not null before attempting to access their members.
