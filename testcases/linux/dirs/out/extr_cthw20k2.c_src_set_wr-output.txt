Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cthw20k2.c_src_set_wr.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function accesses `blk` without validating whether it is null or a valid pointer. If `blk` is null, dereferencing it with `struct src_rsc_ctrl_blk *ctl = blk;` causes undefined behavior. Additionally, the macro `SRCCTL_WR` is undefined in the provided code; using it without definition results in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If `blk` is null, dereferencing it results in a null-pointer dereference, which causes a crash during runtime. This makes the function unsafe unless `blk` is explicitly guaranteed to be non-null.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Validate `blk` before dereferencing:
   ```c
   if (blk == NULL) { 
       return -1; // or another appropriate error code
   }
   ```
2. Ensure `SRCCTL_WR` is defined in a valid scope or passed as an argument to the function.
