UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Possible signed integer overflow in expression `tmp1 -= phiIncr * 48000;` and similar operations involving large multipliers and shifts. Signed integer overflow is undefined behavior in C. Additionally, shifting operations such as `tmp1 <<= 10` on signed integers might invoke undefined behavior if the shift exceeds the bit width of `tmp1`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer handling flaw
Bug Reason: The function performs arithmetic operations on unsigned integers (`tmp1`, `phiIncr`, etc.) which may exceed the range of the variables, leading to unexpected results or truncation. These issues could cause incorrect values for `phiIncr`, `correctionPerGOF`, and `correctionPerSec`, impacting program behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that all arithmetic calculations are done with proper bounds checking or use larger integral types (e.g., `uint64_t`) to avoid overflow. Be cautious with shifts and ensure the operands cannot exceed their bit width.
