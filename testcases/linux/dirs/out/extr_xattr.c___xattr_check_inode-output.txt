UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The subtraction in the expression `end - (void *)header` may result in undefined behavior if `end` points to an address lower than `(void *)header`, as pointer subtraction between unrelated or invalid ranges is not defined by the C standard. Furthermore, the subtraction assumes `end` points to a valid memory location which has not been nullified or corrupted, and there is no explicit validation of `end` prior to its use.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function trusts the `end` pointer without properly validating its range or checking whether it could point to an invalid or unexpected memory location. This could lead to corrupt behavior or improper results. Additionally, if `end` is null or invalid, the subtraction operation could crash the program due to undefined behavior or result in improper logic conditions being evaluated.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate the `end` pointer to ensure it points to a reasonable memory range relative to `header` before performing pointer arithmetic. For example, include a check like `if (header >= end || end == NULL) { error = -EFSCORRUPTED; goto errout; }`. This avoids undefined behavior and protects against invalid ranges.
