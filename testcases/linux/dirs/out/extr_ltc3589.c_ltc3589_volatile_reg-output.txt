UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function operates on a variable `reg`, which is unsigned (`unsigned int`). Without validation that the value of `reg` is within the range of supported cases, accessing an unsupported value in the `switch` statement invokes undefined behavior because there is no corresponding `case` defined for such values. Since this is inherently part of the switch fallthrough, reaching this state does not invoke undefined behavior by itself based on language guarantees, but it may reduce code reliability.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: A missing default case prevents proper handling of unrecognized values of `reg`. If an invalid or unexpected value is passed for `reg`, the function simply returns false, which could lead to incorrect program behavior depending on the calling context. While technically returning false is allowed and may meet requirementscripts. No indicated defined static
