Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_resource_tracker.c_check_mtt_range.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow may occur at the expression `start + size > res_start + res_size` if `size` or `res_size` is very large. This is because signed integer addition is undefined behavior in C when it overflows.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: If integer overflow occurs during the addition in `start + size` or `res_start + res_size`, the result could lead to incorrect range-checking logic, causing invalid ranges to pass or valid ranges to fail the check.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Replace `start + size > res_start + res_size` with a range-check formula that explicitly accounts for potential overflow:  
```c
if (start < res_start || (size > 0 && start > res_start + res_size - size))
    return -EPERM;
```

This ensures that the addition does not cause overflow by rearranging the computation to subtract prior to adding, which is safer and avoids potential overflow scenarios.
