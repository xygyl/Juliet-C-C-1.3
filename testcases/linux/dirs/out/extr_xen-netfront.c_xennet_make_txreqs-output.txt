UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: This function potentially dereferences an invalid pointer (`page`) when the input `offset` value overflows to move to subsequent memory locations without bounds checking. Additionally, signed arithmetic is carried out on `len` (`len -= info.size`), which could underflow if `info.size` exceeds `len`, causing undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory-related  
Bug Reason: The function does not perform necessary range checks for the value of `offset` and `len`. It may cause out-of-bounds memory access when the computed value for `page` exceeds valid boundaries. If `info.size` surpasses `len`, an integer underflow can occur, leading to improper behavior in subsequent iterations of the loop.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add range checks for `page` and `offset` to ensure memory access remains within valid bounds.
2. Verify that `len` is always greater than or equal to `info.size` before performing subtraction to avoid integer underflow. Add appropriate checks or safeguards to handle such cases gracefully.
3. Consider passing validated structures or parameters (with bounds validation beforehand) to prevent invalid or potentially unsafe values.
