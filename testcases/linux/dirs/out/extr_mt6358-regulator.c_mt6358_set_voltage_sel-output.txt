UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences the `info->index_table` pointer without explicitly validating whether it is `NULL`. Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer is undefined behavior in C. Similarly, the `info` pointer retrieved via `rdev_get_drvdata()` isn't checked for `NULL`. If `info == NULL`, subsequent operations such as accessing its member (`index_table`) lead to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If either `info` or `info->index_table` is `NULL`, the dereferencing operation will lead to a crash or undefined behavior. Furthermore, the input `selector` isn't validated against the bounds of the `index_table` array, which might lead to out-of-bounds array access.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add `NULL` checks for the `info` pointer and `info->index_table` before using them in the function:
    ```c
    if (!info || !info->index_table) {
        return -EINVAL;  // Return an error code or perform appropriate error handling.
    }
    ```
2. Validate the `selector` input to ensure it does not cause an out-of-bounds read from `info->index_table`:
    ```c
    size_t table_size = /* determine size of info->index_table */;
    if (selector >= table_size) {
        return -EINVAL;  // Return an error code for invalid selector index.
    }
    ```
By implementing these checks, both undefined behavior and the bug can be mitigated.
