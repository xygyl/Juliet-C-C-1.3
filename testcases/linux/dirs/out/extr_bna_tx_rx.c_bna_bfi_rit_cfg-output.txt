UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `memcpy` operation does not validate the size of `rxf->rit_size` or check whether `rxf->rit_size` is valid. If `rxf->rit_size` is larger than the allocated size of `req->table` or if `rxf->rit` is not initialized, this could lead to undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds memory access or copying from invalid memory.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access
Bug Reason: `rxf->rit_size` could be larger than the size of `req->table`, leading to memory corruption. Similarly, if `rxf->rit` points to unallocated or freed memory, `memcpy` will cause undefined behavior and potentially crash the program.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate `rxf->rit_size` to ensure it does not exceed the size of `req->table`. Also, check if `rxf->rit` is properly initialized before performing the `memcpy`. For example:

```c
if (rxf->rit_size > sizeof(req->table)) {
    // Handle error
    return;
}

if (rxf->rit == NULL) {
    // Handle error
    return;
}

memcpy(&req->table[0], rxf->rit, rxf->rit_size);
```
