UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain operations that are explicitly undefined by the C standard. Here is why:
  - Signed integer overflow is avoided as the function only performs arithmetic operations on unsigned integers `from` and `to`.
  - Array accesses, pointer dereferences, or strict aliasing violations are absent.
  - Variables are initialized properly. Although the temporary variable `tmp` is read before being reassigned, this usage is intentional and the variable is assigned before any computation that could use its value.
  - There is no usage of null or invalid pointers, nor any memory misalignment issues.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function may produce incorrect output under certain circumstances due to an inconsistency in its logic. Specifically:
  - The third part of the function incorrectly evaluates the last partial extent. The calculation of `cur_pos` could result in incorrectly counting extents, as the condition `if (cur_pos < to)` does not account for whether `cur_pos` is off by one or misaligned when the loop for full extents completes.
  - Edge cases where `from` and `to` are very close (but not equal) may return an incorrect number of extents due to insufficient alignment checks when dividing tracks (`trks_per_ext`). The calculation implicitly assumes alignment but does not validate mathematical guarantees of correctness.

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion:  
- Ensure that all conditions for calculating partial extents are rigorously checked. Modify the `if (cur_pos < to)` condition in the third section to account for exact alignment and possible off-by-one errors.
- Insert debug assertions or checks to validate that intermediate results (e.g., `tmp` and `cur_pos`) align correctly and are not deviating from expected values.
