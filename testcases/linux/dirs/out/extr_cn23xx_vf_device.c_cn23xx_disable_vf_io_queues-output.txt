UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not check whether `oct` is `NULL` before dereferencing it. Accessing members of a `NULL` pointer causes undefined behavior according to the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If the `oct` pointer passed to the function is `NULL`, an immediate crash or undefined behavior will occur due to the dereference of `oct->num_iqs` and `oct->num_oqs`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a `NULL` check for the `oct` pointer at the start of the function:
```c
if (oct == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
This ensures the function exits gracefully without attempting to dereference a `NULL` pointer.
