Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cc_hash.c_cc_mac_finup.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: 
1. Casting function pointers to `void *` (`cc_hash_complete` to `cc_req.user_cb`). This violates the strict aliasing rules and is undefined behavior in C.
2. Potential misalignment issues with `state->digest_result_dma_addr` during `set_dout_dlli()` because DMA address alignment and proper initialization cannot be guaranteed without the full context or validation checks in the current code.
3. No validation is performed for `state->xcbc_count` or `ctx->hw_mode`. If these are manipulated incorrectly, further undefined behavior could occur.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: 
1. No validation is performed on `state->digest_result_dma_addr` before using it. This could result in invalid memory access or DMA operation failures if the address is not set properly or aligned.
2. Potential memory mapping issues in `cc_map_req`, `cc_map_hash_request_final`, and `cc_map_result`. Failure handling is implemented, but the underlying calls might cause resource leakage or dangling resources if not handled correctly.
3. The function assumes `ctx->hw_mode` and `drvdata` to be set correctly at all times, with no explicit checks. Bad input states could result in incorrect behavior.
4. `set_dout_dlli()` and `hw_desc_init()` are being used without guarantees on the safety of involved memory or DMA regions.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion:
1. Avoid casting a function pointer to `void *` and use the appropriate type.
2. Add validations for `state->digest_result_dma_addr`, `state->xcbc_count`, `ctx->hw_mode`, and `ctx->key_params.keylen`.
3. Ensure proper DMA address alignment checks are embedded into `set_dout_dlli()` if not already present in its implementation.
4. Double-check all error paths for resource cleanup, particularly when mapping or unmapping memory regions.
