UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior due to shift operation exceeding the width of the target type. Specifically, shifting `1 << 22` and `instance_76 << 29` may result in undefined behavior if `uint32_t` is a 32-bit type (common case). Exceeding 31 bits for left shifts on signed or unsigned integers results in UB in C.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The shift operations (`1 << 22` for `*lo_val` and `instance_76 << 29` for `*hi_val`) could lead to overflow or undefined behavior depending on the size of uint32_t, potentially corrupting the calculated values stored in `lo_val` and `hi_val`. This might cause incorrect memory addresses being calculated or improper hardware operations.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Use 64-bit integers (`uint64_t`) for operations involving large shift amounts, as this will prevent undefined behavior. For example, cast `1` to `uint64_t` before shifting (`(uint64_t)1 << 22` and `(uint64_t)instance_76 << 29`) or define `*lo_val` and `*hi_val` as `uint64_t`.
