UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The call to `sg_nents_for_len` could return negative values, which are assigned to the unsigned type `scalar_t__` field `src_nents` or `dst_nents`. This violates the signed-to-unsigned conversion safety, as the result of such conversions is undefined for negative values. Specifically, `src_nents` and `dst_nents` are defined as `scalar_t__` type, which is expected to be unsigned, but negative values from `sg_nents_for_len` are assigned to these fields.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: There is inconsistent and unsafe handling of return values from `sg_nents_for_len`. Negative values indicate an error, but they are assigned to fields intended to hold positive numbers, leading to potential misuse or invalid logic in subsequent operations. For example, downstream code might incorrectly interpret large cast values due to the unsigned overflow of negative values.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate the return value of `sg_nents_for_len` before assigning it. For example:
```c
scalar_t__ src_nents = sg_nents_for_len(req->src, req->cryptlen);
if (src_nents < 0) {
    dev_err(cesa_dev->dev, "Invalid number of src SG");
    return src_nents;
}
creq->src_nents = src_nents;

scalar_t__ dst_nents = sg_nents_for_len(req->dst, req->cryptlen);
if (dst_nents < 0) {
    dev_err(cesa_dev->dev, "Invalid number of dst SG");
    return dst_nents;
}
creq->dst_nents = dst_nents;
```
This ensures that negative values are handled properly before being assigned to `creq->src_nents` or `creq->dst_nents`.
