Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_coresight-etm3x-sysfs.c_cntr_rld_event_show.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing `config->cntr_rld_event[config->cntr_idx]` has potential undefined behavior if `config->cntr_idx` exceeds the bounds of the `cntr_rld_event` array as bounds checking is not performed.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Array Out-of-Bounds Access  
Bug Reason: If `config->cntr_idx` is set to an invalid or out-of-bound value, it would result in a read from memory outside the array bounds, which can cause crashes or corruption. This is a logic bug that arises from the lack of verification of `config->cntr_idx`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Before accessing `config->cntr_rld_event[config->cntr_idx]`, validate that `config->cntr_idx` is within the bounds of the array. Add explicit bounds checking like:
```c
if (config->cntr_idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(config->cntr_rld_event)) {
    return -EINVAL; // or an appropriate error value
}
```
Where `ARRAY_SIZE` is a macro that computes the size of the array.
