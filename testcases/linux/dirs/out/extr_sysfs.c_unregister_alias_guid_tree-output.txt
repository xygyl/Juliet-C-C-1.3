Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sysfs.c_unregister_alias_guid_tree.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Multiple calls to `kobject_put(p->cur_port)` within the same loop on the same object. `kobject_put` reduces the reference count of a kernel object, and if the reference count drops to zero, it might lead to premature deallocation. Access after such deallocation results in undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Use of Resource After Deallocation (Use-After-Free)  
Bug Reason: Repeated calls to `kobject_put` on the same object (`p->cur_port`) can lead to deallocation of the underlying object and potential use-after-free when accessing it in subsequent iterations. This can cause serious issues like kernel panic.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Remove the redundant multiple calls to `kobject_put(p->cur_port)` in the loop. Instead, call `kobject_put(p->cur_port)` only once per iteration. Consider restructuring the loop to ensure proper cleanup without redundancy.
