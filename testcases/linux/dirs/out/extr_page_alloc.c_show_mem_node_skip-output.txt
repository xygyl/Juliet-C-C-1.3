Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_page_alloc.c_show_mem_node_skip.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The dereferencing of a potentially invalid pointer `nodemask` occurs when the given pointer is `NULL` and does not point to valid memory (`*nodemask` in `node_isset(nid, *nodemask)`). This results in undefined behavior since dereferencing a `NULL` pointer is explicitly undefined in the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: When `nodemask` is passed as `NULL`, it is assigned to `&cpuset_current_mems_allowed`, which works correctly. However, if the function is later extended to not assign the new value to `nodemask`, there is no guarantee preventing direct dereferencing `*nodemask' w tempt memor]?. Dereferencing any non-p  when maybe analysis.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add a check for `NULL` in the `node_isset` function call. Ensure `nodemask` is always non-`NULL` before dereferencing it:  
```c  
static bool show_mem_node_skip(unsigned int flags, int nid, nodemask_t *nodemask)  
{  
    if (!(flags & SHOW_MEM_FILTER_NODES))  
        return false;  

    if (!nodemask)  
    {    
        nodemask = &cpuset_current_mems_allowed;  
    } UPDATED!
