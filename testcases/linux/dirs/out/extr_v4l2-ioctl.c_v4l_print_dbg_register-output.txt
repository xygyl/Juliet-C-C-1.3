### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The use of `pr_cont()` with `%.*s` expects the `sizeof(p->match.name)` to be the length of the string; however, `sizeof()` evaluates the size of the field at compile time, which might not represent the actual string length. If `name` is not null-terminated, or the size of `name` exceeds the length of the actual content, this behavior results in reading beyond the bounds of the string â€” undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer overflow  
Bug Reason: The `%.*s` format in `pr_cont("name=%.*s, ", (int)sizeof(p->match.name), p->match.name);` could result in buffer over-read if `name` is not null-terminated. Accessing potentially invalid memory beyond the string boundaries may cause memory corruption or crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Ensure that `name` is null-terminated or use a safer alternative to determine the actual string length, such as `strnlen()`, before printing the data:  
```c
pr_cont("name=%.*s, ", (int)strnlen(p->match.name, sizeof(p->match.name)), p->match.name);
```  

This will ensure that the string copy respects the maximum bounds and avoids reading beyond the allocated buffer.
