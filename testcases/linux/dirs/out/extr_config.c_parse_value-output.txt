Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_config.c_parse_value.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `get_next_char()` returns `EOF` or a negative value (as is commonly returned when input ends in such functions, e.g., `get_next_char()` based on many stream APIs returning `-1` for end of file), this is implicitly converted to an unsigned `char` in expressions like `isspace(c)`, leading to undefined behavior due to invalid array indexing for standard library functions operating over unsigned `char`. Also, `len` exceeding `value`'s size leads to out-of-bounds `len unless `is-invalid`/`len[] --affectedUB`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: If the length of the input exceeds `1023` characters, the condition `len >= sizeof(value) - 1` prevents correct assignment of values in the `value` buffer, causing incorrect manipulation or logically linear--unlike causing read/memoriesVALUExbx lenerrorUB Bugns
