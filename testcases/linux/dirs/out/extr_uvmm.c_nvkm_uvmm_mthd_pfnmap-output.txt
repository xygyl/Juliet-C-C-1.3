UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The line `if (argc != (size >> page) * sizeof(args->v0.phys[0]))` contains potential undefined behavior. If `page` is greater than 63 (the bit-width of `size`), performing a right shift operation `(size >> page)` could result in a shift amount greater than or equal to the width of the type, which is undefined in C.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The function may incorrectly assume `size >> page` will not result in undefined behavior or an invalid condition due to excessive shift operations. Additionally, no validation ensures `page` is a reasonable value, potentially causing subsequent inaccuracies or UB.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for the `page` value to ensure it's less than the width of `size` (64 in this case). For example:
```c
if (page >= 64 || argc != (size >> page) * sizeof(args->v0.phys[0]))
    return -EINVAL;
```  
This prevents undefined behavior and ensures logical correctness.
