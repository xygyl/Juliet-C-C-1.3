UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing a potentially uninitialized pointer `pdata->batt_name` when accessing its value without validation or initialization could result in undefined behavior. Accessing such uninitialized memory is a violation of the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, Memory allocation failure handling  
Bug Reason: Memory allocation (`kcalloc`) failure is checked (`ret = -ENOMEM;`). However, the pointer `prop` remains unfreed when transitioning to `err4` handling, causing a potential memory leak. Additionally, the function lacks proper validation of `pdata->batt_name`, which may lead to incorrect behavior or crash if `pdata->batt_name` is invalid before use.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Validate `pdata->batt_name` before accessing its value:  
   ```c  
   if (!pdata->batt_name) {  
       dev_info(&dev->dev, "Please consider setting proper battery "  
               "name in platform definition file, falling "  
               "back to name \"wm97xx-batt\"\n");  
       bat_psy_desc.name = "wm97xx-batt";  
   } else {  
       bat_psy_desc.name = pdata->batt_name;  
   }  
   ```  

2. Ensure proper cleanup of allocated memory:  
   ```c  
   err4:  
       if (prop)  
           kfree(prop);  
   ```  

This will prevent undefined behavior from uninitialized pointers and ensure that memory is deallocated correctly when errors occur.
