Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sor.c_tegra_sor_hdmi_setup_avi_infoframe.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code calls `hdmi_avi_infoframe_pack` and uses its return value (`err`) without validating whether the actual range of `err` is safe to index into `buffer` or other constraints imposed by the function. Specifically, `err` is assumed to represent the size of packed data but is later passed to `tegra_sor_hdmi_write_infopack`, which could lead to UB if `err` is negative or exceeds `sizeof(buffer)`, violating array bounds.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The function passes `err` (possibly a negative value returned by `hdmi_avi_infoframe_pack` or an invalid size) to `tegra_sor_hdmi_write_infopack()` as the size parameter without verifying its validity. If `err` is negative or exceeds `sizeof(buffer)`, this may lead to undefined behavior due to invalid memory access or corrupted data handling.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add an explicit range check after the `hdmi_avi_infoframe_pack` call. Ensure that `err >= 0 && err <= sizeof(buffer)` before invoking `tegra_sor_hdmi_write_infopack`. For negative error cases, return the error immediately and avoid further processing.

Updated section of the code:
```c
err = hdmi_avi_infoframe_pack(&frame, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
if (err < 0 || err > sizeof(buffer)) {
    dev_err(sor->dev, "failed to pack AVI infoframe, returned size invalid: %d\n", err);
    return -EINVAL;  // Return a standard invalid argument error code
}
```
