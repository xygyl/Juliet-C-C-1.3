UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The arithmetic on signed integers in `(IB_LRH_BYTES + IB_BTH_BYTES + IB_DETH_BYTES + (grh_present ? IB_GRH_BYTES : 0) + payload_bytes + 4 + 3)` when divided by 4 in `(packet_length = ... / 4)`, is susceptible to signed integer overflow when `payload_bytes` is large. Signed integer overflow is undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: If `payload_bytes` is excessively large, the intermediate addition may result in an overflow due to the signed integer type of `u16` and integer arithmetic operations.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use an unsigned integer type for `payload_bytes` and ensure intermediate arithmetic is performed in a wider type (such as `unsigned long`) before assigning to `u16 packet_length`. Additionally, validate `payload_bytes` against a safe maximum limit to prevent overflow.
