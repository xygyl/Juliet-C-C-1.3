Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nbd.c_nbd_dev_add.c
UB Detected: No
UB Reason: No operations in the function exhibit undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. All pointer allocations, accesses, and memory operations are conditionally validated, such as checking for null pointers after memory allocation (`kzalloc`, `alloc_disk`, `blk_mq_init_queue`) and proper initialization of variables before use.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Leak
Bug Reason: The function does not free allocated resources (`disk` or `nbd`) in certain error-handling paths. For example, in the error condition `if (IS_ERR(q))`, `disk` is not freed after allocation. Similarly, if `blk_mq_alloc_tag_set(&nbd->tag_set)` fails (`goto out_free_idr`), neither `disk` nor `nbd` are freed.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure proper cleanup of all allocated resources in every error path (`disk` via `put_disk`, `nbd` via `kfree`). Update exit labels like `out_free_idr` and others to include proper cleanup calls for both `disk` and `nbd`.
