Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fec_main.c_fec_enet_alloc_queue.c

UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain any operations that violate the C standard. Memory is allocated using `kzalloc` and `dma_alloc_coherent` with proper size arguments, and no operations such as out-of-bounds access, dereferencing invalid pointers, or usage of uninitialized memory are observed.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Management Bug  
Bug Reason: In this function, memory allocation failures (`kzalloc` and `dma_alloc_coherent`) result in returning `-ENOMEM` and invoking `fec_enet_free_queue(ndev)`. However, the `goto alloc_failed` statement is reached before clearing partially allocated resources, which may lead to a memory leak if `fec_enet_free_queue(ndev)` does not handle incomplete allocations correctly. Additionally, `fec_enet_free_queue` is not shown in the provided code, so it's unclear if it releases all allocated memory responsibly.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure proper cleanup of partially allocated memory (e.g., any successfully allocated `tx_queue` and `rx_queue` elements) before returning from the function. Modify `fec_enet_free_queue(ndev)` to handle partial allocations robustly or add explicit cleanup logic before the `alloc_failed` label. Example fix:

```c
alloc_failed:
	for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
		kfree(fep->tx_queue[j]);
	}
	if (fep->rx_queue) {
		for (int j = 0; j < fep->num_rx_queues; j++) {
			kfree(fep->rx_queue[j]);
		}
	}
	fec_enet_free_queue(ndev);
	return ret;
```
