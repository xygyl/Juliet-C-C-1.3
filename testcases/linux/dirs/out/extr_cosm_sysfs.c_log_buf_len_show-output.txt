Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cosm_sysfs.c_log_buf_len_show.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The use of `%p` in the `scnprintf` function attempts to print out the `log_buf_len` member, which is an `int` data type (based on its usage), as a pointer. This violates the C standard as `%p` expects a pointer type and not an integer.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: Printing `cdev->log_buf_len` using the `%p` format specifier will result in a wrongly formatted output and can confuse the intended use of the function. It is also a mismatch in the expected output format of `log_buf_len` for SYSFS and could lead to unintended user-space behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Replace `%p` with `%lu` or `%d`, depending on whether `log_buf_len` is unsigned or signed, as per its intended type. For example, if `log_buf_len` is unsigned, the `scnprintf` call should be updated to `scnprintf(buf, PAGE_SIZE, "%lu\n", cdev->log_buf_len);`. Alternatively, if it is signed, use `%d`.

Updated Function:
```c
static ssize_t
log_buf_len_show(struct device *dev, struct device_attribute *attr,
		 char *buf)
{
	struct cosm_device *cdev = dev_get_drvdata(dev);

	if (!cdev)
		return -EINVAL;

	// Correct the format specifier to match log_buf_len's type
	return scnprintf(buf, PAGE_SIZE, "%d\n", cdev->log_buf_len);
}
```
