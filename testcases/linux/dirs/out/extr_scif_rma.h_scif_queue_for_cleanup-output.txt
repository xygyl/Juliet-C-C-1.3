UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: This function does not verify that its input parameters `window` and `list` are non-NULL before dereferencing them (e.g., `&window->list` and passing `list` to `list_add_tail`). If either of these pointers is NULL, dereferencing them will lead to undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes 
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: The possibility of dereferencing NULL pointers `window` or `list` without any null-check ensures potential null pointer dereference errors.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer checks for both `window` and `list` at the beginning of the function. For example:
```c
if (!window || !list) {
    return;
}
```
This prevents the function from continuing execution if invalid arguments are provided.
