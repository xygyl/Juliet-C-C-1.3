Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mgmt.c_restart_le_scan.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `jiffies` variable, defined as a scalar type, is used without being explicitly initialized, which could lead to undefined behavior depending on the compilation environment. If `jiffies` is being modified by the hardware or kernel outside the function's scope, it could also lead to unpredictable results. Additionally, scalar type `DISCOV_LE_RESTART_DELAY` directly references UB contexts.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Framework-layer.  
Bug Reason: HQ-based isolated layers are inherent undefined cases ("Rewrite WorkScope," ...)  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: GLOBAL framework_consts
