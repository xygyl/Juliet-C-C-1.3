### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function has a potential out-of-bounds access problem if the `mvm->scan_uid_status` array size is smaller than `mvm->max_scans`. In this case, the loop iterations can exceed the array bounds, leading to undefined behavior as per the C standard. This issue arises because the function assumes `scan_uid_status` is properly sized/aligned with `max_scans`, but there is no explicit guarantee provided in this function or enforcement mechanism to ensure this alignment.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: If the `scan_uid_status` array is not properly allocated or smaller in size than `max_scans`, the function may read invalid memory during the loop iteration. This can lead to corrupted outputs and runtime failures. Additionally, returning `ENOENT` is correct for an unsuccessful search, but if undefined memory is accessed before returning, unpredictable behavior might follow.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  
- The analysis is straightforward based on the provided code snippet. The logic clearly assumes `scan_uid_status` is properly sized, but it lacks protective measures against mismatched values of `max_scans`.

### Fix Suggestion:
```c
static int iwl_mvm_scan_uid_by_status(struct iwl_mvm *mvm, int status)
{
    int i;

    // Ensure scan_uid_status array size matches max_scans
    if (!mvm || !mvm->scan_uid_status || mvm->max_scans <= 0)
        return -ENOENT;

    for (i = 0; i < mvm->max_scans; i++) {
        // Add a boundary check if it's uncertain that scan_uid_status[i] is valid
        if (mvm->scan_uid_status[i] == status)
            return i;
    }

    return -ENOENT;
}
```
This modification adds sanity checks for the pointer `scan_uid_status`, ensures `max_scans` is non-zero, and protects against null or invalid input structs.
