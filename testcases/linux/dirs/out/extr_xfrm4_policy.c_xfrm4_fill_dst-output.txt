### UB Analysis

UB Detected: No  
UB Reason:  
- All variables and pointers appear to be properly initialized or assigned before use.  
- No evidence of invalid memory access, null pointer dereference, or unaligned memory operations.  
- Explicit checks (`if` statements) ensure safe handling of `rt->rt_gw_family` before using related fields.  
- No signed integer overflow or misuse of undefined values occurs within the function.  

### Bug Analysis

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason:  
- The comment `/* Sheit... I remember I did this right. Apparently, it was magically lost, so this code needs audit */` suggests uncertainty about the correctness of this block of code. However, there is no direct indication of a functional issue caused by this code. Although the logic copying `rt_flags` reduces its set to just `RTCF_BROADCAST`, `RTCF_MULTICAST`, and `RTCF_LOCAL`, this behavior might unintentionally exclude flags that should also be passed into `xdst->u.rt.rt_flags`.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  

Fix Suggestion: Review the `rt->rt_flags` logic and ensure no unintended exclusion of other flag values. If necessary, consider logging or debugging to verify results in all cases or consult the original design requirements for more clarity.
