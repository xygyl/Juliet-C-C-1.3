UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds write when accessing `f->arr[f->num_members]` if `f->num_members` exceeds the allocated size of the `arr` array. The memory layout or size of `f->arr` is not provided in the given code, and no bounds checking is evident, risking undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer overflow  
Bug Reason: The function assumes `f->arr` can accommodate the new member without checking if the index `f->num_members` exceeds the array size. This could lead to writing past the allocated memory space, resulting in memory corruption or a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check before updating `f->arr[f->num_members]` to ensure `f->num_members` is less than the allocated size of the `arr` array. For example:
```c
if (f->num_members < MAX_ARR_SIZE) {
    f->arr[f->num_members] = sk;
    smp_wmb();
    f->num_members++;
    if (f->num_members == 1)
        dev_add_pack(&f->prot_hook);
} else {
    // Handle error: array capacity exceeded
}
```
