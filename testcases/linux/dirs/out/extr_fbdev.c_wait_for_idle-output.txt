Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fbdev.c_wait_for_idle.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function relies on a function pointer `par->riva.Busy` which is called within the while loop. If `par->riva.Busy` is not initialized or is set to an invalid function pointer, a dereference of the pointer would result in undefined behavior. Additionally, if `par` or `par->riva` is `NULL`, dereferencing them would also trigger undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `par` or `par->riva` is `NULL`, the code will try to dereference a NULL pointer, causing a runtime crash. No checks for `NULL` are present in the function.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `par` and `par->riva.Busy` are not `NULL` before dereferencing them:
```c
static inline void wait_for_idle(struct riva_par *par)
{
    if (!par || !par->riva.Busy)
        return; // Handle this case appropriately (e.g., log an error)
    while (par->riva.Busy(&par->riva));
}
```
