Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pm.c_davinci_sram_push.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The line `(unsigned long)(dest + size)` contains undefined behavior because `dest` is of type `void*`. Pointer arithmetic is not allowed on `void*` types in standard C, as `void` lacks a defined size. Performing arithmetic operations directly violates the standard and results in undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw / Undefined behavior-related issue  
Bug Reason: The undefined behavior described above could lead to incorrect behavior or system crashes depending on implementation details of the platform or compiler. This is a critical flaw, especially if wrong memory ranges are passed to `flush_icache_range`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Convert `void*` to `unsigned char*` before performing pointer arithmetic, as `unsigned char` is guaranteed to have a size of 1 byte:
```c
flush_icache_range((unsigned long)dest, (unsigned long)((unsigned char*)dest + size));
```
