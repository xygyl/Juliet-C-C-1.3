### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Pointer Misalignment Potential**: The `ctx->key_enc` and `ctx->key_dec` are cast to `struct aes_block *`. If these pointers are not properly aligned to the alignment requirements of `struct aes_block`, accessing or manipulating data through them can invoke undefined behavior due to misaligned memory access. ARM platforms often require specific alignment for SIMD operations (e.g., NEON), making this a valid concern.  
2. **Buffer Overrun Potential**: The loop populating the `ctx->key_enc` array (`ctx->key_enc[i] = get_unaligned_le32(...)`) assumes that the `ctx->key_enc` array is large enough to accommodate all expanded keys derived from `key_len`. If `ctx->key_enc` is smaller than required, this can lead to out-of-bounds writes, which is undefined behavior.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overrun  
Bug Reason: If the size of `ctx->key_enc` and `ctx->key_dec` is not sufficiently allocated to accommodate all AES round keys (based on the `key_len` and the key expansion process logic), this function risks writing beyond the allocated memory, causing a buffer overrun. This bug can corrupt memory or cause a crash. There is no explicit size check against the allocation of these arrays, making this a potential bug.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Ensure that the `key_enc` and `key_dec` arrays are correctly allocated to the required size based on `num_rounds(ctx)` and `key_len`. The maximum number of keys needed for AES-256 is `(14 + 1) * 4`, so the correct allocation should reflect this. Validate the size of `ctx->key_enc` and `ctx->key_dec` before writing to them.  

2. Validate the alignment of `ctx->key_enc` and `ctx->key_dec` to ensure they meet the requirements for `struct aes_block` on the target platform. Introduce alignment checks or memory allocation with alignment guarantees.
