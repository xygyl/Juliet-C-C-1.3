### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses the `coords[3]` element of the array without verifying if the array has at least 4 elements. If the passed `coords` array has fewer than 4 elements, this would cause out-of-bounds memory access, leading to undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The function assumes `coords` always has 4 elements, but no guarantees or validations are present. If `coords` has fewer elements, accessing `coords[3]` will result in undefined behavior and potentially a crash or data corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
Add a validation step to ensure the `coords` array has at least 4 elements before accessing `coords[3]`. Alternatively, use a safer mechanism for passing arrays where the size is guaranteed, such as adding a parameter for array size:
```c
static int jornada720_ts_average(int coords[], size_t size)
{
    if (size < 4) return -1; // Handle the case where the array is too small.

    int coord, high_bits = coords[3];
    coord  = coords[0] | ((high_bits & 0x03) << 8);
    coord += coords[1] | ((high_bits & 0x0c) << 6);
    coord += coords[2] | ((high_bits & 0x30) << 4);

    return coord / 3;
}
```
Alternatively, ensure proper documentation specifies the caller's responsibility to pass an array of at least size 4.
