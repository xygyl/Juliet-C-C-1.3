Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sniprom.c_get_system_type.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The global variable `system_type` is used without initialization. Accessing an uninitialized variable leads to undefined behavior per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: If `system_type` is not explicitly initialized elsewhere in the program, the function will return undefined content, possibly causing erroneous behavior or crashes depending on subsequent use.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the `system_type` variable is properly initialized before the `get_system_type()` function is called. For example, set `system_type = NULL` or give it a meaningful default value in the global scope.
