Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_drm_rect.c_drm_rect_calc_vscale.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Possible null pointer dereference if `src` or `dst` is NULL while passed to `drm_rect_height()`. Dereferencing a null pointer leads to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: There is no explicit check for `src` or `dst` being NULL before passing them to `drm_rect_height()`. If one of these pointers is null, the program will attempt to dereference them, causing a crash or undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `src` and `dst` at the beginning of the function. For example:

```c
if (!src || !dst)
    return -ERANGE; // Or another meaningful error code
```
