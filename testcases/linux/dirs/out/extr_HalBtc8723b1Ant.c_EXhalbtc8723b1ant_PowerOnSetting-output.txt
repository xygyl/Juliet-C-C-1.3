UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code does not initialize the `singleAntPath` field of the `boardInfo` structure before accessing its value at `if (pBoardInfo->singleAntPath == 0)` and `else if (pBoardInfo->singleAntPath == 1)`. Accessing uninitialized memory is undefined behavior as per the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The uninitialized field `singleAntPath` can lead to unpredictable behavior when performing comparisons against specific values (e.g., `0` or `1`). Depending on the initial memory state, this could cause incorrect control flow and faulty antenna configuration settings.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the `singleAntPath` and all other relevant fields in the `boardInfo` structure are properly initialized with default values or values read from hardware/firmware before using them in logical expressions.
