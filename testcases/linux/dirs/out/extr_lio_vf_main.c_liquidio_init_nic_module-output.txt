Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_lio_vf_main.c_liquidio_init_nic_module.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function performs out-of-bounds access on the `oct->props` array. Specifically, `oct->props[i].gmxport = -1;` accesses elements beyond `oct->props[0..num_nic_ports-1]` because the loop executes from `i = 0` to `i < MAX_OCTEON_LINKS`, but `oct->props` is only allocated for `num_nic_ports` elements (via `memset(oct->props, 0, sizeof(struct octdev_props) * num_nic_ports)`).
 
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds Access
Bug Reason: This potential out-of-bounds access is a result of overwriting unintended memory, which could corrupt adjacent data or lead to undefined behavior during runtime. It also introduces a logic flaw: the initialization does not respect the allocated size of the array.
 
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
- Limit the loop range to `i < num_nic_ports` instead of `i < MAX_OCTEON_LINKS`. Modify the relevant line as follows:
```c
for (i = 0; i < num_nic_ports; i++)
    oct->props[i].gmxport = -1;
```
- Alternatively, ensure `oct->props` is allocated sufficiently to match `MAX_OCTEON_LINKS` if this range is required for other reasons.
