UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses `s->readback[chan]` without bounds checking for `chan`. If `chan` exceeds the size of the `s->readback` array, this will result in an out‐of‐bounds memory access which falls under undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out‐of‐Bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: The array `s->readback` is indexed using `chan`. However, there is no check to verify that `chan` falls within the valid range of the array. If a malformed or incorrect value for `chan` is passed, it can lead to a buffer overflow or heap corruption.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check for `chan` within the function. Ensure that `chan` is less than the size of the `s->readback` array. For example:  
```c  
if (chan >= ARRAY_SIZE(s->readback)) {  
    return -EINVAL;  // Return an error for invalid channel  
}
```  
Also ensure that `readback` is correctly allocated with sufficient size, and that `chan` corresponds to a valid index.
