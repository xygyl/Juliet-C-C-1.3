Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_qede_main.c_qede_update_pf_params.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The multiplication `(MAX_SB_PER_PF_MIMD - 1) * num_cons` may cause an overflow for `num_cons`, which is of type `u16` (16-bit unsigned integer). Although signed integer overflow is undefined behavior per the C standard, unsigned overflow results in wrapping behavior and is considered well-defined but likely an unintended consequence.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: The multiplication `(MAX_SB_PER_PF_MIMD - 1) * num_cons` assumes that the resultant value fits within the capacity of `pf_params.eth_pf_params.num_cons`, which is likely an integer type but not explicitly verified for sufficient range. If overflow occurs, the value will wrap, leading to incorrect results.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that either `num_cons` and `MAX_SB_PER_PF_MIMD` use types capable of holding the resultant value without overflow (e.g., `uint32_t`) or introduce a check before performing the multiplication to ensure the result fits within the expected type.
