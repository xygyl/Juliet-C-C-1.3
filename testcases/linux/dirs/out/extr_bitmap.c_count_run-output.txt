Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_bitmap.c_count_run.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior in `find_next_bit(*addr, nbits, bit)` if `*addr` (dereferencing `addr`) points to an invalid memory location, or is `NULL`. The dereferencing of `bit` depends on validation outside the function, which is not performed here.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, potential null-pointer dereference, hence assuming large <font-Class=”C<="" No="" privileges). "" Suggestion="">-----
