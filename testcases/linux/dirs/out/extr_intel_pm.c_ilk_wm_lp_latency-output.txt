Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel_pm.c_ilk_wm_lp_latency.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing the array `dev_priv->wm.pri_latency` using `level` without validating the bounds could lead to undefined behavior if `level` is outside the valid range of indices for the array.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out‐of‐bounds array access
Bug Reason: The function does not verify whether the `level` argument is within valid bounds before using it to index the `pri_latency` array in `dev_priv->wm`. If `level` is negative or greater than the size of the array, it results in out-of-bounds access.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `level` is within the valid range of indices for the `pri_latency` array, e.g., `if (level < 0 || level >= ARRAY_SIZE(dev_priv->wm.pri_latency)) return DEFAULT_VALUE;`. Alternatively, enforce bounds checking against any documented constraints on the range of `level`.
