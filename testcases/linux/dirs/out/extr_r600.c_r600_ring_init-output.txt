UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function modifies variables (e.g., `ring_size`) used to calculate its own alignment and buffer size without carefully validating the changes. Specifically, if `ring_size / 8` in `order_base_2(ring_size / 8)` returns arbitrary realistic integers quickly, downstream alignment warnings trigger signed overflow (undefined ⟨16—a magically-masked⟩ items formed at boundaries).
 Integer calculations enable downstream bug parsing mid-ring save. Any signed slice. Secondly, set/support presumed "align & rptr_save_reg" 16 safe ignores high-context elsewhere. ❓
