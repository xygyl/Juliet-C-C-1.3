### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The code does not exhibit undefined behavior. It performs standard arithmetic operations and tests the bounds of `feat_num` against defined constants. All logical conditions are within safe bounds, and there is no evidence of memory access issues, pointer dereferences, or out-of-bounds accesses.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The switch case does not cover all possible values of `feat_num`. Any `feat_num` outside the range `DCCPF_RESERVED < feat_num <= DCCPF_DATA_CHECKSUM` and `DCCPF_SEND_LEV_RATE` will result in returning `-1`. While this could be intentional, if unhandled values of `feat_num` are ever input where this function is called, this could lead to incorrect program behavior (e.g., misinterpretation downstream). This function assumes all features outside the explicitly specified conditions are invalid, but this assumption may not align with future feature definitions.   
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  

### Fix Suggestion
1. If returning `-1` for unknown `feat_num` is the desired behavior, document the function clearly to define its behavior for unhandled cases.
2. Alternatively, add explicit checks or logs for invalid `feat_num` values at the call-site or inside this function to warn developers of unexpected behavior.
