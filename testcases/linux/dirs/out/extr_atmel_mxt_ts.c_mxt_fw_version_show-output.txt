UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Dereferencing a potentially null pointer. The `dev_get_drvdata(dev)` function could return `NULL`, which would make `data` a `NULL` pointer. Attempting to access `data->info` would constitute undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `data` is `NULL`, accessing `data->info` will result in a null pointer dereference. Furthermore, there is no validation that `info` is not `NULL`, so `info->version` or `info->build` could cause additional null pointer dereference if `info` is invalid.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to verify that both `data` and `data->info` are non-NULL before accessing their members. For example:

```c
if (!data || !data->info) {
    return -EINVAL; // or another appropriate error value
}
```
