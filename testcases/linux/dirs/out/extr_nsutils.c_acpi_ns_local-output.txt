Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nsutils.c_acpi_ns_local.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses `acpi_gbl_ns_properties[type]` without verifying whether `type` is within the bounds of the array `acpi_gbl_ns_properties`. If `type` is out of bounds, it results in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access. Accessing past the boundaries of an array invokes undefined behavior as defined by the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: The use of `type` as an array index into `acpi_gbl_ns_properties` without bounds checking can cause an out-of-bounds read, leading to incorrect results or potential access violations. The function performs validation using `acpi_ut_valid_object_type(type)` for legality, but it doesn't explicitly verify the array bounds for `type` when accessing `acpi_gbl_ns_properties[type]`. This could lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit bounds checking for `type` before accessing the `acpi_gbl_ns_properties` array. For example:
```c
if (type >= sizeof(acpi_gbl_ns_properties)/sizeof(acpi_gbl_ns_properties[0])) {
    ACPI_WARNING((AE_INFO, "Object Type 0x%X is out of bounds", type));
    return_UINT32(ACPI_NS_NORMAL);
}
```
