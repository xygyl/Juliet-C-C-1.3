Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_bitmap.c_allocate_without_wrapping_disk.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `new_blocknrs` pointer is incremented (`*new_blocknrs++`) without ensuring that it points to valid memory. This could lead to undefined behavior in scenarios where the memory allocated for the `new_blocknrs` array is too small to accommodate all writes in the loop.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: If the increment of `new_blocknrs` continues past the allocated bounds of the array (for example, if `amount_needed` is larger than the capacity of the array), subsequent writes can corrupt adjacent memory, leading to a buffer overflow. This vulnerability is caused by the lack of bounds checking on the `new_blocknrs` pointer in the loop.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the size of the `new_blocknrs` array is sufficiently large to hold up to `amount_needed` elements. Alternatively, add explicit bounds checks to prevent writing beyond the allocated memory. Example:  
```c
    if (new_blocknrs_index < max_size) {  
        *new_blocknrs++ = start++;  
    } else {  
        // Handle error or terminate allocation early  
    }  
```
