### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain any apparent undefined behavior as per the C standard. It performs a straightforward operation to calculate a size using a macro (`IDMA32C_CTLH_BLOCK_TS`). There are no signed integer operations, dereferencing of pointers (other than `dwc`, which is unused), or array accesses, and the macro usage is well-defined.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function parameter `width` is passed but not used in the function body. This could indicate an oversight where the caller expects `width` to influence the computation but it is ignored, potentially leading to incorrect results, depending on the intended behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: If `width` was intended to modify or scale the size computation, it should be integrated appropriately into the calculation. For example:
```c
return IDMA32C_CTLH_BLOCK_TS(block) * width;
```
Alternatively, if `width` is not required, it should be removed from the function signature to avoid confusion.
