### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code contains a potential undefined behavior due to casting a `void*` pointer (`pDM_VOID`) into a specific type (`PDM_ODM_T`). The standard does not guarantee that the cast will always succeed unless `pDM_VOID` is a pointer to an object that can be safely cast into `PDM_ODM_T`. If `pDM_VOID` is `NULL`, operations on `pDM_Odm` can also lead to undefined behavior when passed to `odm_GetNHMCounterStatistics` or `odm_NHMCounterStatisticsReset`.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The variable `pDM_Odm`, which is initialized from `pDM_VOID` cast to `PDM_ODM_T`, is dereferenced in calls to the functions `odm_GetNHMCounterStatistics` and `odm_NHMCounterStatisticsReset` without a prior check against `NULL`. If the input parameter `pDM_VOID` is `NULL`, this may lead to a runtime null pointer dereference.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
Add a `NULL` check for `pDM_VOID` before performing the cast or dereferencing the variable `pDM_Odm`. For example:  

```c
void odm_NHMCounterStatistics(void *pDM_VOID)
{
    if (!pDM_VOID) {
        /* Handle the error case or return */
        return;
    }

    PDM_ODM_T pDM_Odm = (PDM_ODM_T)pDM_VOID;

    /* Get NHM report */
    odm_GetNHMCounterStatistics(pDM_Odm);

    /* Reset NHM counter */
    odm_NHMCounterStatisticsReset(pDM_Odm);
}
```
