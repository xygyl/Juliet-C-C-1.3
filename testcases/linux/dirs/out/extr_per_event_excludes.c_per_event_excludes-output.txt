Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_per_event_excludes.c_per_event_excludes.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior could occur if `events[4]` exceeds its bounds, as the `event` structure is used without bounds checking in the loop ranging from `i = 0` to `i < 4`. There is no guarantee that the array is properly allocated or defined to have 4 elements in this local scope. This could lead to out‐of‐bounds memory access, which results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, Potential Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The function makes assumptions about the size of the `events` array in multiple places without explicitly ensuring its bounds. If its size were to change or become mismatched with assumptions made here, it would result in memory corruption or a crash due to out‐of-bounds access. This would lead to unintended behavior during execution.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the size of `events` is explicitly verified or enforced to always be 4 elements in the local scope. Consider using `sizeof(events)/sizeof(events[0])` in the loop condition or define the size as a constant (e.g., `#define EVENT_COUNT 4`) to enforce array length consistency throughout the function.
