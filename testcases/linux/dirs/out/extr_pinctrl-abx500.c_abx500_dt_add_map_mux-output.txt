UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If the pointer `map` is NULL, the dereferencing `(*map)[*num_maps]` will lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, the function does not validate the pointer passed for the `map` or the `group` and `function` strings, leaving room for invalid memory access or dereferencing null pointers.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `map` is NULL, dereferencing it as `(*map)` will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to undefined behavior and a potential crash. Additionally, there exists a logic bug where the function does not validate the inputs `group` and `function` to ensure they are non-NULL.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Introduce proper null pointer checks for `map`, `group`, and `function` at the beginning of the function. For example:
```c
if (!map || !group || !function)
    return -EINVAL;
```
This avoids potential undefined behavior and runtime crashes when invalid inputs are passed.
