Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_da9150-charger.c_da9150_charger_battery_get_prop.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function assumes that `psy->dev.parent` is always valid and non-NULL when passed to `dev_get_drvdata`. If `psy->dev.parent` is NULL, `dev_get_drvdata` will dereference a NULL pointer causing undefined behavior. Additionally, `charger` could also be NULL but is not explicitly checked before being used.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `psy->dev.parent` or `charger` is NULL, the subsequent operations will dereference invalid memory and lead to a crash. There is no validation for these pointers before their usage.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit checks for `psy->dev.parent` and `charger` before they are used in the function. For example:
```c
struct da9150_charger *charger = NULL;

if (!psy || !psy->dev.parent) 
    return -EINVAL;  // Error: Invalid parent pointer

charger = dev_get_drvdata(psy->dev.parent);

if (!charger)
    return -EINVAL;  // Error: Invalid charger struct pointer
```
This would ensure that `dev_get_drvdata` and subsequent operations on `charger` are valid.
