UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `video_drvdata` is used without validation, which could potentially lead to undefined behavior if it returns a NULL pointer. Dereferencing a NULL pointer is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `video_drvdata(file)` returns NULL (e.g., file passed doesn't correctly map to a pwc device or isn't valid), accessing `pdev->type` would dereference a NULL pointer, leading to a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate the return value of `video_drvdata(file)` to ensure it is not NULL before dereferencing `pdev->type`. For example:
```c
struct pwc_device *pdev = video_drvdata(file);
if (!pdev)
    return -EINVAL;
```
