UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow can occur during the multiplication of `pixel_clock` and `bpp`. According to the C standard, signed integer overflow is undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: N/A  
Bug Reason: The logic of the function is simple and correct within its prescribed behavior. The function computes the required link bandwidth based on the given parameters in a mathematically correct manner. No memory issues or other logic bugs are apparent in the code provided.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Use unsigned integer types or perform checks to ensure no overflow occurs. Example:  
```c  
static int  
cdv_intel_dp_link_required(unsigned int pixel_clock, unsigned int bpp)  
{  
    return (pixel_clock * bpp + 7) / 8;  
}  
```  
Alternatively, add bounds checking to the input values to ensure no overflow can occur.
