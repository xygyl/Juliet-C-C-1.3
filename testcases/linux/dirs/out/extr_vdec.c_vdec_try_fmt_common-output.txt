UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Access to `pfmt[1].reserved` and `pfmt[2].reserved` happens without ensuring that enough array elements have been allocated in the array `pfmt`. If `pixmp->plane_fmt` points to a statically allocated array of size less than 2 or 3 when corresponding operations execute, then this results in out-of-bound memory access, which constitutes undefined behavior. Also, arithmetic operations in `get_output_size(pixmp->width, pixmp->height)` and division operations may result in undefined behavior if `pixmp->width` or `pixmp->height` are 0.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: Accessing `pfmt[1].reserved` and `pfmt[2].reserved` without verifying that the `plane_fmt` array has allocated memory for at least 2 and 3 elements respectively could lead to buffer overflow if there are fewer elements. Moreover, clamp-constrained dimensions `pixmp->width` and `pixmp->height` need validation to ensure non-zero values before passing them into functions like `get_output_size`, where division by zero or invalid computation might occur.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Before accessing `pfmt[1]` and `pfmt[2]`, verify that `pixmp->num_planes` is appropriately set to 2 or 3, and ensure memory allocation for all required elements in the `plane_fmt` array. For example:

   ```c
   if (pixmp->num_planes < 3) {
       // Handle error or allocate memory for additional planes.
   }
   ```

2. Ensure non-zero dimensions for `pixmp->width` and `pixmp->height` to prevent invalid arithmetic, including divisions by zero in `get_output_size`. You might add bounds validation:

   ```c
   if (pixmp->width == 0 || pixmp->height == 0) {
       // Default values or return error.
   }
   ```  

This ensures safe memory access and avoids any potential UB.
