UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function assumes `num_in_bytes % 4 == 0`, but no check is performed to enforce this condition. If `num_in_bytes` is not a multiple of 4, the `memcpy(&outval, ptr, 4)` call can lead to out-of-bounds memory access. This violates the C standard and is considered undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The `memcpy` call may copy bytes from an invalid memory address if `num_in_bytes < 4` during its final iteration. Consequently, the function could potentially access memory beyond the allocated range of `val`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check before `memcpy` to confirm that `num_in_bytes >= 4`, and handle the remaining bytes appropriately if `num_in_bytes` is not a multiple of 4. For example:
```c
while (num_in_bytes >= 4) {
    memcpy(&outval, ptr, 4);
    SRAM_WRITE(handle, addr, outval);
    num_in_bytes -= 4;
    ptr += 4;
    addr += 4;
}

if (num_in_bytes > 0) {
    unsigned char temp[4] = {0};
    memcpy(temp, ptr, num_in_bytes);
    memcpy(&outval, temp, 4);
    SRAM_WRITE(handle, addr, outval);
}
```
