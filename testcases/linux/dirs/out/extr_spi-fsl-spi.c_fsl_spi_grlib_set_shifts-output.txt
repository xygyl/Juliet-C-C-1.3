UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing null pointers could occur in cases where `rx_shift` or `tx_shift` are passed as `NULL`. The function does not validate these input pointers before dereferencing them. This could lead to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The potential for null pointer dereferencing happens because the function does not check whether `rx_shift` or `tx_shift` are valid (non-NULL) before assigning values. If a caller inadvertently passes `NULL` for one or both pointers, this would cause a runtime crash.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add validation checks for the input pointers before dereferencing them, e.g.:  

```c
if (!rx_shift || !tx_shift) {
    return; // Or handle the error appropriately.
}
```
