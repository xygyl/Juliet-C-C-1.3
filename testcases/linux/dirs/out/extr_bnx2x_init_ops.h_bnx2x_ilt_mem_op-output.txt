UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not define `CNIC_SUPPORT()` and `CONFIGURE_NIC_MODE()` macros/functions within the provided context or code snippet. If these macros/functions evaluate pointer values or involve pointer arithmetic, there may be undefined behavior related to dereferencing null pointers or accessing invalid memory. Without the exact definitions, their behavior cannot be guaranteed to be conformant to the standard.  

Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: N/A  
Bug Reason: The logic of the function appears correct in terms of flow and memory operations. It checks return values (`rc`) carefully before proceeding, ensuring that operations are performed only if the previous calls succeeded.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Verify the definitions of `CNIC_SUPPORT()` and `CONFIGURE_NIC_MODE()` macros or functions to ensure they follow standard-compliant operations and do not invoke undefined behavior. Add explicit null pointer checks if they involve pointer evaluations.
