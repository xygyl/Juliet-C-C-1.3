UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is potential for undefined behavior due to the following issues:  
   - The `group` index is used to access the `pctl->groups[group]` array without bounds checking. If `group` exceeds the number of valid elements in the `groups` array, the behavior is undefined.  
   - Similarly, the `configs[i]` array is accessed without verifying the validity of `num_configs`. If `num_configs` exceeds the allocated size of the `configs` array, this leads to out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason:  
   - The function does not validate whether the `group` index is within range for the `pctl->groups` array, potentially causing memory corruption or crashes.  
   - Additionally, the lack of bounds checks for `num_configs` may cause the `configs` array to be read beyond its allocated size.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
   1. Validate the `group` index before accessing `pctl->groups[group]` to ensure it is within range. This can be done by comparing it against the number of groups.  
   2. Check that `num_configs` does not exceed the allocated size of the `configs` array before iterating over `configs[i]`.  
Example code for group index validation:  
```c
if (group >= /* total number of groups */) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return error code for invalid group index
}
```  
And for configs validation:  
```c
if (num_configs > /* max size of configs array */) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return error code for invalid num_configs
}
```  
Alternatively, ensure these bounds are checked at higher levels of function calls.
