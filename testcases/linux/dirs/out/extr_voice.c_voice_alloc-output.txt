### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The modulo operator (`%`) is used on an array index without a guarantee of valid array bounds. Specifically, operations like `voice = &emu->voices[(i+k) % NUM_G]` and `voice = &emu->voices[(first_voice + i) % NUM_G]` may cause undefined behavior if `NUM_G` is zero. Division by zero (via modulo) is explicit undefined behavior, as `NUM_G` value is not enforced or validated within the function. Additionally, if `emu->voices` does not point to a valid array or its size is less than `NUM_G`, dereferencing results in undefined behavior.  
   
### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, potential out‐of‐bounds memory access  
Bug Reason: If `NUM_G` is zero or if `emu->voices` is not a properly allocated array large enough to hold `NUM_G` elements, the access `emu->voices[(i+k) % NUM_G]` or similar statements can lead to out‐of‐bounds memory access or segmentation faults. Furthermore, there is no check on the integrity of `number` (e.g., ensuring it is within a valid range), which could lead to incorrect calculations affecting `i` and subsequent array accesses.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add validations at the start of the function to ensure `NUM_G` is greater than zero and that `emu->voices` is properly allocated and large enough to hold `NUM_G` elements. For example:  
   ```c
   if (NUM_G <= 0 || emu->voices == NULL || sizeof(emu->voices) / sizeof(emu->voices[0]) < NUM_G) {
       return -ENOMEM;
   }
   ```
2. Validate `number`, ensuring it is within a reasonable range. For example:  
   ```c
   if (number < 1 || number > NUM_G) {
       return -ENOMEM;
   }
   ```

These checks prevent potential undefined behavior and associated bugs.
