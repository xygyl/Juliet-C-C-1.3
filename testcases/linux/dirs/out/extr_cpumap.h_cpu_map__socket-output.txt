### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible out-of-bounds access occurs due to incorrectly checking the bounds of the `s` parameter. The condition `s > sock->nr` does not correctly prevent out-of-bounds access. Since array indices go from `0` to `sock->nr - 1`, the correct check should be `s >= sock->nr`. If `s == sock->nr`, the code tries to access `sock->map[s]`, which leads to undefined behavior.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: The code can attempt to access an out-of-bounds element in the `sock->map` array when `s == sock->nr` due to the incorrect boundary check (`s > sock->nr`). This results in memory corruption or access violations. Additionally, the function does not check whether `sock->map` is `NULL`, which could lead to a `NULL` pointer dereference under certain conditions.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

### Confidence:
High

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Correct the bounds check for `s` by replacing `s > sock->nr` with `s >= sock->nr`.
2. Add a check to ensure `sock->map` is not `NULL` before accessing it:
```c
static inline int cpu_map__socket(struct perf_cpu_map *sock, int s)
{
    if (!sock || !sock->map || s >= sock->nr || s < 0)
        return 0;
    return sock->map[s];
}
```
