UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit any undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. It only returns a constant error status (`-ENOSYS`) without performing any operations that could lead to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: There is a logic issue due to the function not setting or using the `snr` parameter passed to it. Since the intent of the function is likely to read the signal-to-noise ratio (as implied by its name and parameter), failing to set the `snr` value makes the function implementation incomplete or incorrect from a logic standpoint.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Update the function to compute or fetch the `snr` value appropriately and set the `snr` parameter before returning. If calculating the SNR cannot currently be implemented, document the function with a comment clearly describing why it's not implemented and consider setting `snr` to a default value to avoid confusion. Example:
```c
*snr = 0; // Placeholder value indicating not implemented
return -ENOSYS; // Not implemented
```
