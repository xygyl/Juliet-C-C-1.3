UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The multiplication `num *= p_hwfn->cdev->num_hwfns;` may cause undefined behavior if `p_hwfn->cdev->num_hwfns` or `num` results in a value exceeding the range of what `u8` can hold (0â€“255), causing signed overflow or wrapping.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: The multiplication `num *= p_hwfn->cdev->num_hwfns;` could lead to a value exceeding the maximum range of `u8`. Since `num` is later bit-shifted and masked into `param`, this could cause incorrect configuration in systems where the result is intended to represent a valid range.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use a wider integer type for the `num` variable (e.g., `unsigned int`) or add bounds checking to ensure the multiplication result fits within the range of `u8` before assigning or processing further.
