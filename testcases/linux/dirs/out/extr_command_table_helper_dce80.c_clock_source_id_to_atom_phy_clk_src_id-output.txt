UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Left-shifting or right-shifting values can result in undefined behavior if the shift value is greater than or equal to the width of the type over which shift is applied. In this case, `atom_phy_clk_src_id >> 2` assumes that `atom_phy_clk_src_id` is initialized to a valid value. However, if any of the constants like `ATOM_TRANSMITTER_CONFIG_V5_P0PLL`, `ATOM_TRANSMITTER_CONFIG_V5_P1PLL`, etc., are undefined or invalid, and `atom_phy_clk_src_id` assumes a garbage/uninitialized value or a non-defined behavior edge case, leading UB during `value`.  

Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: <valid standard>
