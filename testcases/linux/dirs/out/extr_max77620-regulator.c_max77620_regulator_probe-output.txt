Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_max77620-regulator.c_max77620_regulator_probe.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function conditionally assigns `pmic->enable_power_mode[id]` without verifying whether the `id` index exceeds the allocated size of `enable_power_mode`. If `MAX77620_NUM_REGS` exceeds the actual size allocated for `enable_power_mode`, this results in an out-of-bounds memory access, which is undefined behavior according to the C standard.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory-related bug (Out-of-bounds array access)  
Bug Reason: The same out-of-bounds memory access caused by writing to `pmic->enable_power_mode[id]` can lead to corruption of adjacent memory, which may result in system instability or crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before assigning `pmic->enable_power_mode[id]`, validate the array size versus `MAX77620_NUM_REGS` to ensure that `id` will not exceed the allocated memory regions. For example:

```c
if (id >= ALLOCATED_SIZE_OF_ENABLE_POWER_MODE)
    return -EINVAL; // Handle the error appropriately
```

Additionally, ensure all arrays (like `pmic->reg_pdata`) being accessed via `id` are properly allocated to safely accommodate `MAX77620_NUM_REGS` elements.
