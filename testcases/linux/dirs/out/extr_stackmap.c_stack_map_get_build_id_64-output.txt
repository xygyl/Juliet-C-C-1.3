UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing an invalid or misaligned pointer could occur when `page_addr` is improperly aligned or when `page_addr + sizeof(Elf64_Ehdr)` results in misaligned access to the `phdr` array. Additionally, if `page_addr` is invalid or null, dereferencing it (`Elf64_Ehdr *ehdr = (Elf64_Ehdr *)page_addr;`) leads to undefined behavior. Furthermore, when adding `page_addr + phdr[i].p_offset`, the resulting pointer could be invalid or out of bounds without validation.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory access and logic flaws  
Bug Reason: There is no validation of whether `page_addr` is a valid and properly aligned address. Similarly, no checks are in place to ensure `page_addr + phdr[i].p_offset` points to a valid memory range, potentially resulting in access to uninitialized or invalid memory. Finally, arithmetic performed in `(PAGE_SIZE - sizeof(Elf64_Ehdr)) / sizeof(Elf64_Phdr)` assumes valid scaling and might encounter integer precision issues depending on system architecture.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:
1. Validate `page_addr` before use to ensure it is non-null and adequately aligned for the `Elf64` structs.
2. Add bounds checking to ensure the calculated pointers (`page_addr + sizeof(Elf64_Ehdr)` and `page_addr + phdr[i].p_offset`) fall within valid memory ranges.
3. Add checks for integer precision when performing arithmetic operations such as `(PAGE_SIZE - sizeof(Elf64_Ehdr)) / sizeof(Elf64_Phdr)` and ensure it does not overflow or yield unintentional results.
