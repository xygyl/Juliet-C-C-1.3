### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain typical undefined behavior patterns. Pointer dereferences are performed safely, integer operations do not indicate overflow risks (assuming caller provides sane values), arrays are not accessed out of bounds, and there are no detectable uninitialized variable reads or violations of strict aliasing rules.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function may fail silently when `retry_crc_err` is set to `true` during the polling loop (`mmc_poll_for_busy`). The retry mechanism for CRC errors within the polling function appears to be incomplete since the failure path (`goto out`) does not distinguish CRC-related failures from other errors. Additionally, it is unclear whether the timeout semantics are strictly validated, potentially resulting in misbehavior when `timeout_ms > host->max_busy_timeout` or `timeout_ms == 0`. Furthermore, failure handling for state rollback (`timing` restoration in `mmc_set_timing`) might introduce inconsistencies if `mmc_switch_status(card)` modifies timing but fails, and is conditionally restored only when `timing` is set.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Enhance error reporting to distinguish CRC retry failures from fatal errors within `mmc_poll_for_busy`.
2. Add validation logic for `timeout_ms`, ensuring it cannot exceed `host->max_busy_timeout` unless explicitly documented or intended.
3. Always restore `old_timing` when `send_status` is enabled and the function detects an error during `mmc_switch_status`.
4. Document expected behavior when `timeout_ms == 0` to ensure hardware or software defaults do not conflict.
