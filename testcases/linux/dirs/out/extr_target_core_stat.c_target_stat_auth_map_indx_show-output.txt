Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_target_core_stat.c_target_stat_auth_map_indx_show.c

UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function does not contain any operations that inherently lead to undefined behavior as per the C standard. Memory access patterns like dereferencing pointers (`nacl` and `deve`) are protected by checks (`if (!deve)`). The use of `rcu_read_lock`/`rcu_read_unlock` and `snprintf` appear correct and do not violate strict aliasing rules, access uninitialized variables, or invoke undefined results. There is no signed integer overflow or out-of-bounds array access.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The function performs a `snprintf` call to write a hardcoded value of `0` for `scsiAuthIntrLunMapIndex` to the `page` buffer. However, based on the context and function name, it seems like the function is intended to calculate the LUN mapping index related to the `deve` object. The "FIXME" comment acknowledges this discrepancy, indicating that proper logic for deriving the `scsiAuthIntrLunMapIndex` from `deve` is missing. This is likely an incomplete implementation and not functioning as intended.

Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Replace the hardcoded `0` value with an actual calculation or extraction of `scsiAuthIntrLunMapIndex` from the `deve` object. Ensure that the absence of proper logic (indicated by the "FIXME" comment) is addressed, allowing the function to fulfill its intended purpose. Add error handling if `deve` is unavailable to ensure graceful degradation.
