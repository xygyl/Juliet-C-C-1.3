Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dma.c_alchemy_pcm_close.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `substream->stream` is out of bounds for the array `ctx->stream`, accessing `ctx->stream[stype].substream` or `ctx->stream[stype].dma` would lead to undefined behavior. There is no check to validate `stype` against the size of `ctx->stream`.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `substream->stream` is always within the valid range of the `ctx->stream` array. Without validation, a corrupted or malicious input could access memory outside the bounds of this array.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: Add a check to validate that `substream->stream` (i.e., `stype`) is within the valid range for the `ctx->stream` array. For example:
```c
if (stype < 0 || stype >= NUM_STREAMS) {
    return -EINVAL; // Error handle invalid stream type
}
```
Replace `NUM_STREAMS` with the correct size of the `ctx->stream` array.
