UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The return value of `kstrtoint` is incorrectly checked against `1`. According to the kernel's `kstrtoint` documentation, the function returns `0` on success and a negative error code on failure. Comparing its return value to `1` is undefined behavior since the program will interpret the result incorrectly, potentially leading to unintended behavior. 

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The `if (num != 1)` check likely causes the `EINVAL` error to be returned regardless of the actual conversion result from `kstrtoint`, leading to improper handling of valid inputs due to checking the wrong condition. Additionally, the mismatch in interpretation could cause erroneous input processing.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace the condition `if (num != 1)` with `if (num != 0)` to correctly evaluate the output of `kstrtoint`. This aligns with its documented behavior that provides `0` for success and a negative value for failure.

Fixed snippet:
```c
if (num != 0)
    return -EINVAL;
```
