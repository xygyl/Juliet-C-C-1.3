### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences the `u8 *pTable` pointer (`Address = pTable[0] | ...`) without verifying whether the pointer has adequate memory allocated or mapped. If `pTable` points to an invalid or insufficient memory region, the behavior is undefined as per the C standard. Additionally, using `pTable += sizeof(u32)` and `pTable += sizeof(u16)` assumes proper alignment, which could violate alignment requirements on certain architectures, leading to undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `pTable` contains a properly formatted structure of data, including valid addresses, lengths, and buffers. There is no bounds-checking or validation to prevent out-of-bounds access while iterating over `pTable`. If `Address` or `Length` values are corrupt or inaccurate, the function could read/write invalid memory areas, leading to potential buffer overflows or memory corruption.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Add validation for `pTable` to ensure its contents are correctly formatted before dereferencing. For example:
   ```c
   if (!pTable || Address == 0xFFFFFFFF || Length > MAX_LENGTH) {
       // Handle invalid input case
       break;
   }
   ```
2. Introduce bounds-checking logic to ensure that `Length * 2` and subsequent operations do not access memory outside the allocated range of `pTable`.
3. Verify alignment requirements explicitly or use memcpy-like operations to prevent misaligned accesses.
