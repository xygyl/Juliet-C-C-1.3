Filename: `/home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_builtin-top.c_display_thread.c`
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `poll` function's third argument (`delay_msecs`) is computed as `top->delay_secs * MSEC_PER_SEC`. If `top->delay_secs` is negative, the result becomes undefined behavior due to passing a negative timeout to `poll`. Additionally, `getc(stdin)` is used without ensuring that the `stdin` stream is valid, which could lead to undefined behavior if `stdin` is corrupted or closed.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Bug and Potential UB-triggered Bug
Bug Reason: The logic handling for `perf_top__handle_keypress(top, c)` could result in inconsistent behavior depending on `stop_top()`'s invocation. Furthermore, failure to validate `stdin_poll.fd` against being invalid or ensuring `stdin` stream's validity may lead to runtime errors. 
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
1. Ensure `top->delay_secs` is non-negative before computing `delay_msecs`:
   ```c
   delay_msecs = (top->delay_secs < 0 ? 0 : top->delay_secs) * MSEC_PER_SEC;
   ```

2. Check if `stdin_poll.fd` is valid and `stdin` stream exists before issuing `getc(stdin)`. Avoid direct usage of `getc` without validation:
   ```c
   if (stdin_poll.fd >= 0 && stdin != NULL) {
       c = getc(stdin);
   } else {
       stop_top();
       return NULL;
   }
   ```

3. Review the logic in `perf_top__handle_keypress()` to ensure it safely handles all cases before invoking `goto repeat` or `stop_top()` to avoid inconsistency.
