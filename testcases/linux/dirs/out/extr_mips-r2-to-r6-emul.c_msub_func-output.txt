Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mips-r2-to-r6-emul.c_msub_func.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow may occur when calculating `res = (s64)rt * (s64)rs;` or when performing bit shifts and subtraction with `res`. Signed integer overflow leads to undefined behavior as per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: The computation `res = (s64)rt * (s64)rs;` involves potentially large values that can exceed the range of a signed 64-bit integer (s64). This can cause incorrect results and disrupt the high (`hi`) and low (`lo`) register calculations.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that inputs `rt` and `rs` are checked and confirmed to stay within safe ranges before performing the multiplication. Alternatively, use a larger type or detect and handle overflow explicitly during the computation.
