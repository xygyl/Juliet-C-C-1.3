UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The provided function dereferences `_block` without verifying that the pointer is not null. If `_block` is null, dereferencing `block[0]`, `block[1]`, ..., `block[7]` will trigger undefined behavior due to an invalid memory access. Additionally, the function assumes `_block` points to valid memory of sufficient size to access `block[7]`. If `_block` does not point to at least 8 `u64` values (64 bytes), this too would result in undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not check whether `_block` is null before dereferencing it, potentially causing a runtime null pointer dereference bug. Additionally, there may be out-of-bounds memory access if `_block` does not point to a buffer large enough to contain the required 8 `u64` elements. Both issues could lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add a null pointer check for `_block` at the beginning of the function:
   ```c
   if (_block == NULL) {
       // Handle the error, e.g., log or return.
       return;
   }
   ```
2. Ensure the caller guarantees the `_block` points to a buffer of at least 8 `u64` elements, or add appropriate checks in the function to validate the size of the buffer (if accessible) before dereferencing.
