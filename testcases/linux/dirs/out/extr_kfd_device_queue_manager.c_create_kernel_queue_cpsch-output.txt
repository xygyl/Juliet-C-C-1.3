UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain operations that clearly lead to undefined behavior within the scope of the code provided. Signed integer overflow, null pointer dereferencing, uninitialized variable usage, strict aliasing violations, or other UB causes are not evident.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logical Bug  
Bug Reason: The check `dqm->total_queue_count >= max_num_of_queues_per_device` is handled correctly by returning `-EPERM` when the condition is true, but `dqm->total_queue_count` is incremented unconditionally afterward. This unconditional increment appears logical invalidation since it contradicts the intent. If queue creation fails, `total_queue_count` should not be incremented. This results in an incorrect accounting of the total number of queues, which could cause future calls to incorrectly fail or succeed.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Move the `dqm->total_queue_count++` increment to only occur after verifying the condition `if (dqm->total_queue_count >= max_num_of_queues_per_device`, and ensuring the creation of the queue starts successfully. For example:  

```c
if (dqm->total_queue_count >= max_num_of_queues_per_device) {  
    pr_warn("Can't create new kernel queue because %d queues were already created\n",  
            dqm->total_queue_count);  
    dqm_unlock(dqm);  
    return -EPERM;  
}  

// Increment only after the condition is satisfied and queue creation starts.
dqm->total_queue_count++;  
```  

This ensures the increment happens only when it's valid to create the queue.
