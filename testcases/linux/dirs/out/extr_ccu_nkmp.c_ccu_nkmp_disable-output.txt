Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_ccu_nkmp.c_ccu_nkmp_disable.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `return` statement inside the `ccu_nkmp_disable` function is improperly used in a `void` return type function. Returning a value in a `void` function violates the C standard and is classified as undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: N/A  
Bug Reason: The logic itself seems correct. However, the undefined behavior introduced by the erroneous `return` statement doesn't directly cause logical issues in the code. The bug is tied to UB occurrence rather than standalone.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `return ccu_gate_helper_disable(&nkmp->common, nkmp->enable);` with a proper call to the function without the `return` keyword:
```c
ccu_gate_helper_disable(&nkmp->common, nkmp->enable);
```
