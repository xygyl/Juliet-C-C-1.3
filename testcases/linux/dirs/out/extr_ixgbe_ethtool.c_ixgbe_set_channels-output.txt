UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior arises due to the implicit type conversion in operations on unsigned integers (`unsigned int count`). Although it doesn't cause immediate UB under typical circumstances, issues might arise if `count` exceeds the maximum value representable in `unsigned int` or if there are operations that depend on signed integer interpretations.
