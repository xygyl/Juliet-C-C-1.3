UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior arises from the `udelay` usage and to a lesser degree, lack of guarantees runtime, use retain-clustered interrupt chip guarantees usage increases exposure to less-monitored bus lock static bottlenecks indirect concurrency guarantees. passes unknown guarantees runtime.Report kills stack/workloop cluster hierarchical tests,branches retain-count
