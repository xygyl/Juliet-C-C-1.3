UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function has a fall-through in the switch statement "switch (val)" in handling the `DRM_MODE_SCALE_NONE` case, which by default proceeds to the subsequent cases (e.g., `DRM_MODE_SCALE_FULLSCREEN`, etc.). As fall-through behavior is not intended here (based on the comment logic), the lack of a `break` leads to undefined behavior or unintended execution.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The logic in the `switch (val)` statement for the `DRM_MODE_SCALE_NONE` case allows unintended fall-through to subsequent cases instead of isolating this case. This is inconsistent with the documented logic for `DRM_MODE_SCALE_NONE`, as described in the comments. This may cause incorrect program behavior depending on the input to `val` and the connector type.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a `break` statement after handling the `DRM_MODE_SCALE_NONE` case to ensure proper isolation of the logic set forth by the comments.
