### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Use of potentially out-of-bounds register memory access due to arithmetic on `mmSYNC_MNGR_SOB_OBJ_1023`, `mmSYNC_MNGR_MON_STATUS_255`, and loop logic. These macros (`mmSYNC_MNGR_SOB_OBJ_0`, `mmSYNC_MNGR_MON_STATUS_0`, etc.) appear to reference hardware register ranges, and any miscalculated offset or boundary exceeding acceptable register limits results in undefined behavior in accessing hardware. Moreover, there is no guarantee that `mmSYNC_MNGR_SOB_OBJ_1023` and `mmSYNC_MNGR_MON_STATUS_255` are valid register addresses. Unchecked assumptions about hardware registers may lead to UB.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw / hardware register access issue  
Bug Reason: 
1. The calculation of `num_of_sob_in_longs` and `num_of_mon_in_longs` incorrectly includes the constant `+4`, which results in loops potentially accessing invalid register addresses (`mmSYNC_MNGR_SOB_OBJ_1023 + 4` or `mmSYNC_MNGR_MON_STATUS_255 + 4`).
2. Writing to out-of-bounds registers in `WREG32` due to incorrect boundary calculations in the loop introduces hardware register corruption or undefined consequences on memory-mapped I/O.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
- Ensure that `mmSYNC_MNGR_SOB_OBJ_1023` and `mmSYNC_MNGR_MON_STATUS_255` define valid offsets within the hardware register boundaries.
- Correct the calculation of `num_of_sob_in_longs` and `num_of_mon_in_longs` to properly represent the number of registers to clear:
  ```c
  num_of_sob_in_longs = (mmSYNC_MNGR_SOB_OBJ_1023 - mmSYNC_MNGR_SOB_OBJ_0 + 1);
  num_of_mon_in_longs = (mmSYNC_MNGR_MON_STATUS_255 - mmSYNC_MNGR_MON_STATUS_0 + 1);
  ```
- Ensure loop logic does not exceed calculated offsets, and validate hardware constraints to guarantee no out-of-bound register access.

Fixing these issues ensures correctness, prevents UB, and eliminates the logic flaw.
