UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: There is a possibility of dereferencing a null pointer leading to undefined behavior. Specifically:
1. **Line 39**: `swap(skb, ctx->tx_rem_skb)` can dereference `ctx->tx_rem_skb` if it is null.
2. **Line 81, alloc_skb**: A null pointer check for memory allocation failure is later followed by dereferencing the pointer. However, there are scenarios where subsequent attempts to allocate memory still persistate .
Regression are lurking simply unless tiedup well.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Management Bug
