UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `table_size` calculation uses `sizeof(struct phm_samu_clock_voltage_dependency_table)` multiplied by `table->numEntries`. However, `struct phm_samu_clock_voltage_dependency_table` has not been defined to allocate space for multiple entries. This calculation fails to account for the space required for the `entries` array inside this struct, causing potential memory over-allocation or under-allocation. Accessing `entries[i]` later in the loop could lead to out-of-bounds memory access (undefined behavior).  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: The allocation for `samu_table` may not properly account for the size of the `entries` array based on the number of entries. If `table_size` is incorrectly calculated due to the use of `sizeof(struct phm_samu_clock_voltage_dependency_table) * table->numEntries`, attempting to access `samu_table->entries[i]` could lead to memory corruption or access violations.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Update the `table_size` calculation to properly account for the size of the `entries` array. The correct calculation could be:  
```c
table_size = sizeof(struct phm_samu_clock_voltage_dependency_table) + 
             sizeof(struct sam_dependency_entry) * table->numEntries;
```  
Here, `struct sam_dependency_entry` refers to the type of individual entries in the dependency table (not defined explicitly in the provided code). Replace `struct sam_dependency_entry` with the correct type representing one entry. Also, ensure that `entries` inside `struct phm_samu_clock_voltage_dependency_table` is dynamically allocated based on the `numEntries` count.
