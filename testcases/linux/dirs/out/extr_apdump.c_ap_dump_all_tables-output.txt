Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_apdump.c_ap_dump_all_tables.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code dereferences `table` without checking if it is `NULL` after calling `acpi_os_get_table_by_index`. If this function fails and `table` remains uninitialized, dereferencing it leads to undefined behavior. Additionally, there is potential reliance on not validating `AP_MAX_ACPI_FILES` or proper control of loop bounds.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `acpi_os_get_table_by_index` fails and `table` is set to `NULL`, the function `ACPI_FREE(table)` dereferences it. This could lead to a null pointer dereference bug.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: After calling `acpi_os_get_table_by_index`, verify if `table` is `NULL` before accessing or freeing it. The loop's condition should also validate the return status to ensure it terminates safely without relying solely on `AE_LIMIT`. Example:  
```c  
if (ACPI_FAILURE(status)) {  
    if (!table) {  
        continue;  
    }  
    // Handle other errors or return appropriately.  
}  
```
