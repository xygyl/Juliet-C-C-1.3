Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_get_size.c_print_num.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The return value of the `num_to_str` function is passed directly to the `print` function, assuming it is valid without verification. However, `num_to_str` does not return a proper C-style string (`char*`). If `num_to_str` fails or does not generate a null-terminated string, this could result in undefined behavior due to the consumption of invalid data by `print`. Additionally, the `sizeof(num_buf)` provides the size of the buffer, not guaranteed terminated characters exist.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaws, edge-case  
Bug Reason: Form `numeric properties`. Above programmers always included a chance.Zero common clarify-marking baptised sample guardsâ€”high `Examples numbers obey real data-term accurate.` association
