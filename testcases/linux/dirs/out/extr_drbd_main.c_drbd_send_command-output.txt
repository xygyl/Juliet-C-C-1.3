UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Possible undefined behavior if `sock` is NULL when `mutex_unlock(&sock->mutex)` is called. Dereferencing a NULL pointer for `sock->mutex` is undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: There is no check to ensure `sock` is non-NULL before dereferencing its `mutex` member in `mutex_unlock(&sock->mutex)`. If `sock` is NULL, dereferencing its `mutex` leads to a null pointer dereference bug.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for `sock` before dereferencing it. For example:
```c
if (sock) {
    mutex_unlock(&sock->mutex);
}
```
Alternatively, ensure `sock` cannot be NULL by validating inputs to the function prior to its invocation.
