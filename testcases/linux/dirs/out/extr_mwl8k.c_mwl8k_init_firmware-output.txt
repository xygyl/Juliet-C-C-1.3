UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses recursive `goto retry` logic without ensuring that `count` eventually reaches zero. If `MAX_RESTART_ATTEMPTS` is set to a large value or misconfigured (e.g., negative or zero), the `goto retry` statement could lead to an infinite loop, which is undefined behavior in practical terms, as it violates termination guarantees.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The logic flaw arises due to the unguarded `goto retry` mechanism, which risks infinitely retrying firmware loading if conditions are not satisfied (e.g., `MAX_RESTART_ATTEMPTS` is misconfigured or `mwl8k_load_firmware()` continually fails). This could hang the system unnecessarily.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Introduce a check to ensure `MAX_RESTART_ATTEMPTS` is positive and prevent infinite loop risk. Replace `goto retry` with an explicit loop structure for better clarity and maintainability. For example:

```c
while (count > 0) {
    /* Reset firmware and hardware */
    mwl8k_hw_reset(priv);

    /* Request firmware */
    rc = mwl8k_request_firmware(priv, fw_image, nowait);
    if (rc) {
        wiphy_err(hw->wiphy, "Firmware files not found\n");
        return rc;
    }

    if (nowait)
        return rc;

    /* Load firmware into hardware */
    rc = mwl8k_load_firmware(hw);
    if (rc)
        wiphy_err(hw->wiphy, "Cannot start firmware\n");

    /* Reclaim memory */
    mwl8k_release_firmware(priv);

    if (!rc)
        break;  // Successfully loaded firmware

    count--;
    wiphy_err(hw->wiphy, "Trying to reload the firmware again\n");
    msleep(20);
}

return rc;
```
