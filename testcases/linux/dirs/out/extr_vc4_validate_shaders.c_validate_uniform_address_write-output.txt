Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vc4_validate_shaders.c_validate_uniform_address_write.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: **Integer comparison against `-1` without proper type handling**. The value `add_lri` is compared with `-1` without explicitly ensuring its type compatibility, potentially resulting in undefined behavior due to signed/unsigned mismatch. If `raddr_add_a_to_live_reg_index()` returns a value outside the valid range for the type of `add_lri`, this would cause UB.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The validity check of `add_lri == -1` may fail incorrectly if `add_lri` is an unsigned type, leading to incorrect rejection of valid uniform address resets, or false acceptance of invalid ones.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Change the `add_lri` variable to a signed type (`int`) or explicitly cast it before comparing with `-1`.

Example fix:  
```c
if ((int)add_lri == -1) {
    DRM_DEBUG("First argument of uniform address write must be "
              "an immediate value.\n");
    return false;
}
```
