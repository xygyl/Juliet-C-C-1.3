UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `dev->real_num_tx_queues` exceeds the actual size of `np->queues` array, accessing `np->queues[i]` results in out-of-bounds array access which is undefined behavior. There is no verification of `dev->real_num_tx_queues` against the actual allocated size of `np->queues`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: The function assumes `dev->real_num_tx_queues` matches the size of the `np->queues` array. If this assumption is incorrect (i.e., `num_queues` is greater than the allocated size of `np->queues`), there will be out-of-bounds memory access, leading to potential memory corruption, crashes, or unpredictable behavior.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a safety check to verify that `dev->real_num_tx_queues` does not exceed the actual size of `np->queues`. For example:
```c
unsigned int max_queues = /* actual size of np->queues */;
if (num_queues > max_queues) {
    num_queues = max_queues;
}
```
Alternatively, ensure that `dev->real_num_tx_queues` is always correctly synchronized with the array size during initialization or in the driver setup.
