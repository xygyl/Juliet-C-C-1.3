Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_op_model_power4.c_power7_marked_instr_event.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code contains a potential signed left-shift operation (`1 << pmc`) where the value of `pmc` might exceed the maximum allowable size for a signed integer. If `pmc` equals or exceeds 31, the behavior of left-shifting a signed 32-bit integer in C is undefined. Additionally, there is reliance on shifts coupled with masking operations which might lead to unintended behaviors depending on `mmcr1` value or `pmc` value scaling.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: There are potential errors in accurately calculating `cntr_marked_events`. Specifically, the code relies on scalar left-shift (`1 << pmc`). If `pmc == 31+Cases special will risk misc-bits MEMORY overflows`. Some masking downstream also risk downstream  missed- right sized slip codes risk.  
Bug Caused by UB: Risks?<Confidation Medium --Fix!
