UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `rd->rpl[id]` access is prone to undefined behavior if `rpl` is `NULL` or if `id` is out of bounds for `rd->rpl`. This can lead to a segmentation fault or invalid memory access depending on runtime conditions.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Memory Access  
Bug Reason: If the value of `id` derived from `contraint_to_pl(rd, cid)` is invalid (negative or exceeds the bounds of `rpl`), the access to `rd->rpl[id].prim_id` will result in out-of-bounds memory access. Also, if `rd->rpl` is `NULL`, dereferencing it results in a logic bug causing a crash.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Validate that `rd->rpl` is not `NULL` before dereferencing it.  
   ```c
   if (!rd->rpl) {
       ret = -EINVAL;
       goto get_time_exit;
   }
   ```  
2. Check that `id` is within bounds. Assuming the size of `rpl` is bounded by a known constant `RPL_MAX_SIZE`, add a bounds check like:  
   ```c
   if (id < 0 || id >= RPL_MAX_SIZE) {
       ret = -EINVAL;
       goto get_time_exit;
   }
   ```  
This ensures both `NULL` pointer dereference and out-of-bounds access are handled.
