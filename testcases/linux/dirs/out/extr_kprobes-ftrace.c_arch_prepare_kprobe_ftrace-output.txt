UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Assigning the value `-1` to the `boostable` field, which is declared as an `int` but may imply undefined behavior due to the signed integer representation not being properly validated for context-dependent use (e.g. how `boostable` is later utilized could lead to UB if `-1` is unexpected and triggers incorrect logic).
Bug Detected: **Reason-specific Bug= Type analysis Error!
Bug 
Bug Caused by UB: indirect variable association concern detecting
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Verify the `boostable` field is expected and allowed to hold negative values explicitly in its design and usage context across the codebase. If not, replace `-1` with a suitable valid value, such as `0` or define a specific constant like `BOOSTABLE_UNDEFINED`.
