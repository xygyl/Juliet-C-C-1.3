Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_emc2103.c_read_temp_from_i2c.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If either of the `read_u8_from_i2c` calls fail (returning a value < 0), the fields `temp->degrees` and `temp->fraction` are left uninitialized. Accessing uninitialized variables results in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Uninitialized Memory Access
Bug Reason: If either `read_u8_from_i2c` fails, the subsequent use of the `temp` structure without initializing its fields can lead to unpredictable results or the use of garbage values.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Initialize the `temp` structure fields `degrees` and `fraction` to a default value (e.g., 0) at the start of the function to ensure they are always in a defined state. For example:
```c
temp->degrees = 0;
temp->fraction = 0;
```
Alternatively, consider signaling the failure in a way that calling code can handle more robustly (e.g., returning an error code or using a flag to indicate invalid data).
