UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function has a potential null pointer dereference. If `info` is passed as `NULL`, dereferencing `info->regmap` and `info->pdev->dev` would trigger undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The pointer `info` is used directly without validation. If `info` is NULL, calling any member access functions on it (such as `info->regmap` or `info->pdev->dev`) will lead to a null pointer dereference and crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!info) {
    return -EINVAL;  // Or another appropriate error code
}
```
This ensures `info` is valid before accessing its members, avoiding UB and related bugs.
