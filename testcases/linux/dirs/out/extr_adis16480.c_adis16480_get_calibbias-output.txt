Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_adis16480.c_adis16480_get_calibbias.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: `adis16480_calibbias_regs[chan->scan_index]` may access out of bounds if `chan->scan_index` exceeds the bounds of the array. The code does not check if `chan->scan_index` is within permissible bounds. Additionally, if the `scan_index` is invalid and leads to an out-of-range memory access, this is undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logical Flaw and Potential Invalid Memory Access
Bug Reason: An invalid access to `adis16480_calibbias_regs` can lead to segmentation faults or data corruption. Moreover, the default case for the channel type does not provide sufficient feedback to the caller to handle unexpected situations effectively or ensure safety.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add boundary checks for `chan->scan_index` to ensure it does not exceed the bounds of the `adis16480_calibbias_regs` array. Also, ensure proper error handling for unsupported `chan->type` values by implementing a more robust default case.

Example:
```c
if (chan->scan_index >= ARRAY_SIZE(adis16480_calibbias_regs)) {
    return -EINVAL; // Index out of bounds
}
```
Implement this boundary check before accessing `adis16480_calibbias_regs`.
