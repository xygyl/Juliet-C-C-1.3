### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `REG` macro is assumed to generate an address or register offset for `regmap_write` based on the input parameters. However, the implementation of `REG` is not provided, and if `REG` produces an invalid or out-of-bounds register address, dereferencing or using such an address in `regmap_write` is undefined behavior. Additionally, calling `gpiochip_get_data(chip)` without ensuring `chip` is a valid pointer could lead to undefined behavior if `chip` is null or invalid.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug / Potential Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `gpiochip_get_data(chip)` will always return a valid pointer (`info`), but it does not check if `info` is `NULL`. If `gpiochip_get_data` returns `NULL` (e.g., due to failure or invalid input to `chip`), subsequent dereferencing of `info->map` will result in undefined behavior and a crash.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium

### Fix Suggestion
1. Add a null check for the return value of `gpiochip_get_data`:
   ```c
   struct ocelot_pinctrl *info = gpiochip_get_data(chip);
   if (!info)
       return; // Or handle the error appropriately
   ```

2. Ensure that the `REG` macro is defined correctly to produce valid register addresses and verify its output if there is a possibility of invalid addresses.
