Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_binderfs_test.c_write_to_file.c

UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function avoids undefined behavior by properly handling system call errors and type conversions. Signed-to-unsigned conversions (`(size_t)ret`) are safe since the `write_nointr()` function returns `ssize_t`, which does not overflow its cast in this context. Additionally, pointer dereferencing and arithmetic overflow are not evident.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Error handling logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function assumes `errno` during failure cases is consistent after calling `close(fd)`. However, if `close()` alters `errno`, the `saved_errno` set before closing may no longer represent the actual reason for failure. This could cause incorrect exit messages during error reporting. This situation is rare but can occur if `close()` returns an error (e.g., due to file descriptor issues).  

Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: To preserve the integrity of the error reported by `write_nointr`, move the `saved_errno = errno;` statement after `close(fd)` or before the `errno` variable is modified anywhere in the function. For example:
```c
on_error:
    close(fd);  // Perform any cleanup first.
    ksft_exit_fail_msg("Failed to write to file %s\n", filename);
```
Optionally, check if `close()` fails and handle its error explicitly.
