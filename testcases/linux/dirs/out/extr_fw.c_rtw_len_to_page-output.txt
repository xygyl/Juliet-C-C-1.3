UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Division by zero could occur if `page_size` is zero when passed to `DIV_ROUND_UP`. Division by zero is undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function does not check if `page_size` is zero, leading to potential division by zero and incorrect behavior. This is a logic flaw caused by insufficient validation of input.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add an input validation check at the beginning of the function to ensure `page_size` is not zero. For example:  
```c
if (page_size == 0) {
    return 0; // or handle this input error in a suitable manner
}
```
