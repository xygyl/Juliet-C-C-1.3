UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The global `coex_dm` pointer is dereferenced without ensuring it is non-null. If `coex_dm` has not been properly initialized, dereferencing it results in undefined behavior. Additionally, the `mdelay()` function may lead to UB if used improperly in sensitive timing contexts, though this is specific to the environment and platform.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `coex_dm` is null, any access to its members (e.g., `coex_dm->cur_dac_swing_on`) will cause a null pointer dereference. This can result in a crash or unexpected behavior. The code does not include any checks to verify the validity of `coex_dm`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null-pointer check for `coex_dm` at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!coex_dm) {
    RT_TRACE(rtlpriv, COMP_BT_COEXIST, DBG_LOUD, "[BTCoex], coex_dm is NULL, aborting execution\n");
    return;
}
```
