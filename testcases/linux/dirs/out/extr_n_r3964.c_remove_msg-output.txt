### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The field `pMsg->block` is accessed without ensuring that `pMsg` is non-NULL. If `pClient->first_msg` is NULL, `pClient->first_msg` is assigned to `pMsg`, and thereâ€™s no further check before accessing `pMsg->block`. This may cause undefined behavior due to dereferencing a NULL pointer.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `pMsg` is always valid (non-NULL) within the `if` block, and fields of `pMsg` (such as `block` and `next`) are accessed without verifying the validity of the pointer. In cases where `pClient->first_msg` is NULL, a NULL pointer dereference will occur.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
Add a check to ensure `pMsg` is non-NULL before accessing any of its fields. For example:
```c
if (pMsg != NULL && pMsg->block) {
    remove_client_block(pInfo, pClient);
    pClient->next_block_to_read = pMsg->block;
}
```  
Additionally, ensure the `if (pClient->first_msg)` condition adequately guarantees that `pMsg` will not be NULL. Further code review or testing is needed to confirm this.
