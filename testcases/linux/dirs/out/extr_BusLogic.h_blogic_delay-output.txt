Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_BusLogic.h_blogic_delay.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The multiplication `1000 * seconds` could result in signed integer overflow if `seconds` is large enough (e.g., larger than `INT_MAX / 1000`). Signed integer overflow is undefined behavior according to the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer overflow
Bug Reason: If `seconds` is large enough, the multiplication result may not be within the range of an `int`, leading to incorrect value of the delay time passed to `mdelay`. If `seconds` is a positive integer but results in an overflow, the delay behavior may be unpredictable.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use a wider integer data type like `unsigned long long` for the multiplication to avoid overflow. Alternatively, clamp the input value `seconds` to a safe range where `1000 * seconds` doesn't overflow. For example, check `if (seconds > INT_MAX / 1000)` and handle it appropriately (e.g., print an error or limit the value of `seconds`). Implement the fix as follows:

```c
static inline void blogic_delay(int seconds)
{
    if (seconds > INT_MAX / 1000) {
        /* Handle overflow case appropriately */
        seconds = INT_MAX / 1000;  // Clamp to avoid overflow
    }
    mdelay(1000 * seconds);
}
```
