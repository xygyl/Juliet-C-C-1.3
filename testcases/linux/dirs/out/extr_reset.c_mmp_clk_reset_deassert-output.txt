UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: There is a potential issue with out-of-bounds access. The `id` parameter is used as an index to access the `cells` array in `unit->cells[id]`, but there is no validation to confirm that the value of `id` falls within the bounds of the array. If `id` is outside the valid range, this will result in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds memory access.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Array Out-of-Bounds
Bug Reason: The lack of bounds checking on the `id` parameter can result in accessing invalid memory locations. If the array access goes beyond the allocated bounds of `unit->cells`, this may cause crashes, corruption, or unexpected behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking for the `id` parameter before accessing `unit->cells[id]`. Ensure that `id` is less than the number of elements in the `cells` array to prevent out-of-bounds access. For example:
```c
if (id >= NUM_CELLS || id < 0) // NUM_CELLS should represent the array size
    return -EINVAL;
```
Replace `NUM_CELLS` with the appropriate constant or computed value indicating the size of the `cells` array.
