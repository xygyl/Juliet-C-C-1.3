Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_stdio.c_number.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The undefined behavior arises from attempting to negate a value of type `signed long long` (`num = -(signed long long)num;`) while `num` is already `LLONG_MIN`. In this case, `LLONG_MIN` cannot be negated in signed arithmetic due to exceeding the range of `signed long long`, leading to signed integer overflow, which is undefined behavior per the C standard.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: Negating `LLONG_MIN` causes the function to produce incorrect results in cases where `num` is the most negative value of `signed long long`. This logical issue arises directly due to the undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: To avoid undefined behavior, use unsigned arithmetic when handling negative values explicitly to prevent signed overflow. For instance, replace:  
```c  
num = -(signed long long)num;  
```  
with:  
```c  
num = (unsigned long long)(~num + 1);  
```  
Alternatively, handle specific edge cases such as `LLONG_MIN` separately to avoid negation overflow.
