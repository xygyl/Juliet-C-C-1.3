UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Undefined behavior may occur if the `val` argument is greater than `(1U << 32) - 1`. Right-shifting values that exceed the bounds for `uint32_t` can lead to undefined behavior due to C's rules for shifting unsigned values. While this is not guaranteed within the provided `uint32_t` range, careful assumptions of write shifts cause that manipulation without deterministic normative datapoint values --on practical terms, be they compliant within normative compiled kernel elements safety.

Bug Detected: Yes 
Bug Type: Integer Overflow Safety violation potentially.

Bug Reason: Safety arise across integer-driven overflow assumes +( pointers improperly dereference a `uint_scale` implimentations earlier dereference numeric values the passing correctness risks forcing integer mode safesories ranges }.  
Bug Caused by UB-Low-Medium
