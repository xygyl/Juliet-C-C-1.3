Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_en_fs_ethtool.c_put_flow_table.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Unsigned integer wraparound occurs when pre-decrement is applied to `eth_ft->num_rules`. If `num_rules` is a `size_t` or another unsigned type, decrementing it below zero causes a wraparound to the maximum value of the unsigned type, leading to undefined behavior according to the C standard rules (integer overflow for unsigned wraps around).

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The check `if (!--eth_ft->num_rules)` may not behave as intended if `num_rules` is unsigned. If `num_rules` decrements below zero due to wraparound, the `mlx5_destroy_flow_table` function call might be skipped, leaving `eth_ft->ft` unmodified and potentially leading to resource leaks later.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Change the type of `num_rules` to signed integer or reconsider the logic to explicitly prevent unsigned wraparound:
```c
if (eth_ft->num_rules > 0 && --eth_ft->num_rules == 0) {
    mlx5_destroy_flow_table(eth_ft->ft);
    eth_ft->ft = NULL;
}
```
