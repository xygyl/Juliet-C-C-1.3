### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not perform operations known to exhibit undefined behavior according to the C standard. All values are explicitly defined and manipulated safely, and type casting is appropriately handled. There are no uninitialized variables, no memory dereferencing errors, and no indication of integer overflow (bit shifts remain within safe bounds as per variable sizes).  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logical Bug  
Bug Reason: The function hardcodes the `aad1_len` variable to `0`, which suggests that it does not support Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) for encryption. If AAD is required in certain use cases, this logic will fail to set a meaningful length for `AAD1`. This may result in unintended behavior when the `SPU2_FMD` struct is used downstream. Additionally, by setting `aad2_offset` to `aad1_offset` without validating `aad1_len`, the function assumes `AAD2` starts immediately after `AAD1` without ensuring logical separation. While this is not directly memory unsafe, it could lead to incorrect results in encryption or unintended consequences.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: Medium  

Fix Suggestion:  
- Allow the caller to specify `aad1_len` as a parameter instead of hardcoding it to `0`.  
- Validate `aad1_offset`, `aad2_offset`, and `payload_offset` range to ensure logical consistency if the function is used in cases where AAD is needed.
