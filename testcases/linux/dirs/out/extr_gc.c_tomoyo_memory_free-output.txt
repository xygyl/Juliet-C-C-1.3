Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_gc.c_tomoyo_memory_free.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `ptr` parameter is assumed to be a valid pointer passed to both `ksize()` and `kfree()`. However, if `ptr` is `NULL`, calling `ksize(ptr)` results in undefined behavior because `ksize()` expects a valid allocated pointer and does not handle `NULL` safely. Additionally, passing `NULL` to `kfree()` is safe (according to the Linux kernel implementation), but the `ksize()` issue persists.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related bug
Bug Reason: Subtracting `ksize(ptr)` from `tomoyo_memory_used[TOMOYO_MEMORY_POLICY]` when `ptr` is `NULL` leads to corrupted memory accounting. This can create inaccuracies in tracking memory usage which might propagate logic flaws elsewhere in the system.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a `NULL` check for `ptr` before calling `ksize()` and `kfree()`:
```c
static inline void tomoyo_memory_free(void *ptr)
{
    if (ptr != NULL) {
        tomoyo_memory_used[TOMOYO_MEMORY_POLICY] -= ksize(ptr);
        kfree(ptr);
    }
}
```
