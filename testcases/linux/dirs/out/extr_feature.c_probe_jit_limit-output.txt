### UB Analysis

UB Detected: No  
UB Reason:  
The function does not contain operations associated with undefined behavior as per the C standard. Key observations:
1. The function `read_procfs` is invoked with a string literal; unless `read_procfs` is improperly defined elsewhere, this invocation is safe.
2. Checking `json_output` for truthiness is safe, as it expects `json_output` to hold a valid scalar value, which does not result in undefined behavior.
3. There is no evidence of null pointer dereferencing, signed integer overflow, out-of-bounds accesses, or uninitialized usage in the snippet provided.

### Bug Analysis

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason:  
The snippet does not account for the possibility that `read_procfs` could return unexpected or invalid value(s) based on a malformed `/proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_limit` file or errors during file access. This could lead to misleading outputs or incorrect handling of failure cases. Specific issues:
- The case where `read_procfs` returns `-1` is correctly handled, but there is no verification or sanitization of other values returned by `read_procfs`. For example, an anomalous large integer or a negative result (other than `-1`) could represent erroneous behavior.
  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion

1. Verify that the return value of `read_procfs` strictly falls into the expected range (e.g., `>= 0` for valid memory sizes).
2. Enhance error handling for values `res` that fall outside the expected input range by adding a default case for unexpected results.

Updated code snippet for better robustness:
```c
static void probe_jit_limit(void)
{
	int res;

	/* No support for C-style output */

	res = read_procfs("/proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_limit");
	if (res < 0 && res != -1) {
		printf("Error: unexpected return value from read_procfs\n");
		return;
	}
	if (json_output) {
		jsonw_int_field(json_wtr, "bpf_jit_limit", res);
	} else {
		switch (res) {
		case -1:
			printf("Unable to retrieve global memory limit for JIT compiler for unprivileged users\n");
			break;
		default:
			printf("Global memory limit for JIT compiler for unprivileged users is %d bytes\n", res);
		}
	}
}
```
