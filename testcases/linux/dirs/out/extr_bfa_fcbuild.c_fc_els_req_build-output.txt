UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not appear to invoke undefined behavior. The operations performed are standard C-language constructs, including pointer dereferencing, memory copying, and basic data assignments. Memory alignment, strict aliasing rules, and integer operations are respected.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential memory corruption  
Bug Reason: The function `fc_els_req_build` assumes that `fchs` points to a valid, allocated memory buffer with sufficient space to hold `sizeof(struct fchs_s)` bytes. If this precondition is violated (e.g., if `fchs` is `NULL` or points to insufficiently sized memory), the call to `memcpy()` will lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption. Since there is no validation or guarantee of `fchs`'s validity within the function, this constitutes a potential bug.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the caller validates `fchs` before calling this function, or add a check within the function to ensure `fchs` is not `NULL`. Additionally, a mechanism to guarantee the memory region is large enough to hold `sizeof(struct fchs_s)` should be in place. For example:

```c
if (!fchs) {
    // Handle error: fchs is NULL
    return;
}
```

Alternatively, document the precondition that `fchs` must point to valid memory in the API documentation.
