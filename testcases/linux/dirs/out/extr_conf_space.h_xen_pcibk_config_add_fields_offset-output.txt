UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing `field[i].size` without knowing the bounds or ensuring that `field` is a valid pointer and properly initialized may result in out-of-bounds memory access or dereferencing a null or invalid pointer, which is undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds memory access  
Bug Reason: The loop iterates over `field[i]` until `field[i].size == 0`, but there is no guarantee that the memory area `field` is valid or correctly terminated in this manner. This can lead to out-of-bounds reads or writes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before entering the loop, validate that the `field` pointer is non-NULL and check if the structure `field` includes a sentinel value or if its size is pre-determined to avoid out-of-bounds access.
