Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nfs4state.c_reset_union_bmap_deny.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The loop uses `i & deny` for comparison; however, the variable `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 per iteration. When `i` exceeds 3 (since the loop checks `i < 4`), the bitwise operation becomes meaningless for `deny` and accesses potentially unintended portions of the `deny` bitmap. Specifically, `i` does not represent individual bits beyond the value of 3, and this mismatch can cause unpredictable behavior depending on the input `deny`. This constitutes undefined behavior according to standard bitwise operator rules in C, as the values vary unpredictably depending on inputs.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The logic assumes `i` to be individually bitmap values (1, 2, 4). However, `i` exceeds reasonable bitmap values supported by a 2-bit flag (denoting binary values `01`, `10`, `11`). As `i` increments to 3, the `clear_deny` function may incorrectly modify data due to erroneous bit masking. This also causes potential future issues when the `change` flag fails to set correctly if irrelevant or unintended values are processed due to mismatches in bitmask interpretation.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace the loop logic with specific bitmask checks (`1`, `2`, `4`) rather than incrementing `i` linearly. For instance:
```c
if ((deny & 1) != 1) {
    change = true;
    clear_deny(1, stp);
}
if ((deny & 2) != 2) {
    change = true;
    clear_deny(2, stp);
}
if ((deny & 4) != 4) {
    change = true;
    clear_deny(4, stp);
}
```
This ensures the mask aligns with intended bit values regardless of input.
