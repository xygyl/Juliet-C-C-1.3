Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_softfloat.c_float64_to_uint32_round_to_zero.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: 
1. **Signed Integer Overflow:** The operation `z = -z;` can cause signed integer overflow if `z` equals `0x80000000`. Signed integer overflow is undefined behavior as per the C standard.
2. **Left Shift of a Negative Value:** The operation `(aSig << shiftCount)` is undefined if the left-hand operand is negative or if the result exceeds the range of `bits64`.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: The computation `z = -z;` risks signed integer overflow when `z` equals `0x80000000`, resulting in undefined behavior and potentially incorrect logic.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
To prevent signed integer overflow, use `uint32_t` for `z` rather than `int32_t`, or implement specific checks to ensure the value does not exceed the signed integer limit when flipping its sign. For the left shift potential UB, validate `shiftCount` to ensure it does not exceed the width of the type and confirm `aSig` is non-negative.

Updated line for signed overflow prevention:
```c
uint32_t z = aSig;
```

Alternatively, integrate specific boundary checks before performing operations:
```c
if (aSign && (z > (int32_t)0x80000000)) {
    float_raise(float_flag_invalid);
    return 0x80000000;
}
```
