### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible undefined behavior due to `snprintf()` potentially being called using a buffer that could lead to out-of-bounds access, depending on the `len` parameter. Specifically:
1. When `r >= len`, the condition implies the buffer could have been overrun in previous calls to `snprintf`. This is undefined behavior as modifying memory outside the bounds of `str` is not defined by the C standard.
2. Signed integer overflow is another risk if the value of `r` is very large, and integers are mismanaged during buffer manipulation (`len -= r`).

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory-related bug (buffer overflow risk)  
Bug Reason: The `snprintf()` function assumes the buffer (`str`) passed to it is sufficiently sized for the entire operation. However, the program blindly subtracts `r` from `len` and increments `str` by `r`, without confirming that the buffer would not exceed allocated limits. If `nelem` is high or if the values in the `array` are large integers, concatenated buffer writes could exceed the available space implied by `len`. This has high potential for buffer overflow.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Use safer techniques to limit `snprintf()` behavior and ensure the buffer is not overrun. For instance:
```c
if (r < 0 || (size_t)r >= len) {
    return;  // Handle snprintf failure gracefully
}
```
2. Tighten checks during the loop: before each `snprintf()` call, verify that there is sufficient space remaining:
```c
if (len <= 0) {
    return;
}
```
3. Consider using bounds-checked dynamic memory or a string buffer utility, especially when `nelem` can vary significantly.
