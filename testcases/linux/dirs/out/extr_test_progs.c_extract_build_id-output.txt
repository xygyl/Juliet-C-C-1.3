### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. The memory allocated for `line` is uninitialized, and it is passed to `getline`. The `getline` function requires `line` to either point to `NULL` initially (so it can dynamically allocate memory) or point to an already-allocated buffer. The behavior is undefined if `line` is uninitialized or set to a value other than `NULL`.  
2. The `build_id[len] = '\0';` line may trigger an out-of-bounds write. The logic prior to this line does not check if `len` is equal to or exceeds the size of the `build_id` array. This can lead to buffer overflow and undefined behavior when accessing memory beyond the provided `size`.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer overflow, Resource leak  
Bug Reason:   
1. Buffer Overflow: As described in the UB section, if `len > size`, the assignment `build_id[len] = '\0'` may write outside the allocated bounds of `build_id`.  
2. Resource Leak: In the `goto err:` path, the `fp` stream is being closed using `fclose(fp)`. However, if `getline` allocates memory for `line`, this memory is not freed, causing a memory leak.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion  
1. Ensure that `line` is explicitly initialized to `NULL` before calling `getline`. This is essential to guarantee `getline` behaves correctly.
   ```c
   char *line = NULL;
   ```
2. Before assigning the null terminator in `build_id[len] = '\0';`, validate `len` against `size - 1`. This ensures the write does not exceed the bounds of the `build_id` buffer.
   ```c
   if (len > size)
       len = size - 1;  // Adjust len to prevent overflow
   memcpy(build_id, line, len);
   build_id[len] = '\0';
   ```
3. Free the memory allocated by `getline` after `fclose(fp)` to prevent resource leaks.
   ```c
   if (line != NULL)
       free(line);
   ```

Updated function snippet:
```c
int extract_build_id(char *build_id, size_t size)
{
    FILE *fp;
    char *line = NULL;  // Initialize to NULL
    size_t len = 0;

    fp = popen("readelf -n ./urandom_read | grep 'Build ID'", "r");
    if (fp == NULL)
        return -1;

    if (getline(&line, &len, fp) == -1)
        goto err;

    fclose(fp);

    if (len > size)
        len = size - 1;
    memcpy(build_id, line, len);
    build_id[len] = '\0';

    free(line);  // Free allocated memory
    return 0;

err:
    if (line != NULL)
        free(line);  // Prevent memory leak
    fclose(fp);
    return -1;
}
```
