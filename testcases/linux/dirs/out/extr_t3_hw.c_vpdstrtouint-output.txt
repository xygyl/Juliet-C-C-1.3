UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses the memcpy function to copy `len` bytes from `s` into `tok`. However, the size of `tok` is fixed at 256 bytes, and there is no check to ensure that `len` does not exceed the length of `tok`. If `len > 256`, this results in a buffer overflow, which is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer overflow  
Bug Reason: The `len` value is not validated against the size of `tok` (256 bytes). If `len` exceeds 256, memory beyond the bounds of `tok` will be written to, corrupting adjacent memory locations. This causes a buffer overflow.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before calling `memcpy`, ensure that `len` is less than or equal to 255 (because `tok[len] = 0` requires an additional byte for the null terminator). For example:  
```c
if (len > 255) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return an appropriate error code
}
memcpy(tok, s, len);
tok[len] = 0;
```
Additionally, ensure `s` is properly verified for being non-null to avoid dereferencing a null pointer.
