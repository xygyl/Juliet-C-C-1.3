### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not appear to exhibit any undefined behavior. Specifically:
- `CAN_PSR` is assumed to be a macro or function that takes valid `dev_priv` pointers and does not result in UB itself.
- The pointer `dev_priv` though passed in as `data`, is expected to be valid and non-null (likely ensured by the caller).
- Usage of `READ_ONCE` ensures proper memory handling even in concurrent environments, preventing issues like tearing or compiler optimizations causing UB.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function operates under the assumption that the `data` pointer, cast to `struct drm_i915_private *`, is always valid and non-null. However, there is no explicit guarantee within the function that `data` is non-null. If a null pointer is passed to this function (likely due to an external bug in the caller logic), dereferencing it via `dev_priv->psr.debug` would result in a null pointer dereference and crash.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
To address the potential null pointer issue, add a null pointer check for `data`:
```c
if (!data)
    return -ENODEV;  // Return an appropriate error code if data is null.
```

Revised code snippet:
```c
static int
i915_edp_psr_debug_get(void *data, u64 *val)
{
    struct drm_i915_private *dev_priv = data;

    if (!data || !CAN_PSR(dev_priv))  // Add null pointer check for data
        return -ENODEV;

    *val = READ_ONCE(dev_priv->psr.debug);
    return 0;
}
``` 

This ensures safe operation even when `data` is null.
