UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: There is no evidence of undefined behavior in the function as per the C standard. All operations, such as pointer manipulation, conditional statements, and bitwise operations, follow defined semantics. For example:
   - The address pointer `addr` is checked for validity using `is_zero_ether_addr(addr)`.
   - Integer arithmetic and bitwise operations do not overflow due to limited operations.
   - Memory accesses are confined to the bounds of the `mac_table` array, as the iteration respects `hw->mac.num_rar_entries`.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function may incorrectly return `-ENOMEM` when an address is not found in the table, which is misleading because this is not a memory allocation issue. A more appropriate return code would be `-ENOENT` (indicating that the entry was not found). This could lead to confusion during debugging or error handling.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `return -ENOMEM;` with `return -ENOENT;` to correctly indicate that the requested entry was not found in the `mac_table`.
