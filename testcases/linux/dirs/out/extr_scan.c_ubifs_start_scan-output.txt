Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_scan.c_ubifs_start_scan.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `sbuf + offs` pointer arithmetic operation may lead to undefined behavior if `offs` causes the pointer address to exceed the allocated buffer (`sbuf`) size or results in an invalid pointer computation. This could happen due to insufficient validation of `offs` and the buffer constraints.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory corruption or buffer overread
Bug Reason: The pointer arithmetic for `sbuf + offs` assumes that `offs` is within the bounds of the allocated memory for `sbuf`. If `offs` exceeds the size of the buffer or is invalid, the subsequent memory access in `ubifs_leb_read` could read beyond the allocated memory, leading to buffer overread and potential memory corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before performing pointer arithmetic, validate that `(offs >= 0)` and `(offs < allocated_size_of_sbuf)` to ensure the resultant memory access is within bounds. Additionally, include checks for `sbuf` being a valid non-NULL pointer before its usage.
