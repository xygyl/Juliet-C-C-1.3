UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing `adapter->tx_rings[i]` without verifying that `i < adapter->num_active_queues`. If `num_active_queues` does not match the size of the `tx_rings` array (e.g., if it is larger), this leads to out-of-bounds memory accessâ€”a form of undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: If `adapter->num_active_queues` exceeds the size of the `adapter->tx_rings` array, the loop can attempt to access memory outside the valid bounds of `tx_rings`. This could cause a crash or corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Introduce a safeguard to ensure that `i < size_of_tx_rings`, where `size_of_tx_rings` is the actual allocated size of the `tx_rings` array. For example, pass the size explicitly or validate `num_active_queues` against the actual allocation before using it as a loop boundary.

Example fix:
```c
void iavf_free_all_tx_resources(struct iavf_adapter *adapter, size_t size_of_tx_rings)
{
    int i;

    if (!adapter->tx_rings)
        return;

    for (i = 0; i < adapter->num_active_queues && i < size_of_tx_rings; i++)
        if (adapter->tx_rings[i].desc)
            iavf_free_tx_resources(&adapter->tx_rings[i]);
}
```
Alternatively, ensure `num_active_queues` is always less than or equal to the allocated size for `tx_rings` when configuring `adapter`.
