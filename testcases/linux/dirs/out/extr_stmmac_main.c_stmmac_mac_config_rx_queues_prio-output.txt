Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_stmmac_main.c_stmmac_mac_config_rx_queues_prio.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses the `prio` member of `priv->plat->rx_queues_cfg[queue]` without verifying if `queue` is less than the size of the array or if the memory has been properly allocated. If `queue` exceeds the array bounds, this results in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory-related bug (out-of-bounds array access)  
Bug Reason: The loop does not protect against `queue` exceeding the bounds of `priv->plat->rx_queues_cfg` array. If `rx_queues_cfg` is not properly allocated or has a smaller size than `rx_queues_count`, this can result in a read beyond the limits of the allocated memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add an explicit bounds check to ensure `queue` is within the valid size of the array `rx_queues_cfg`. For example:  
```c
for (queue = 0; queue < rx_queues_count; queue++) {
    if (queue >= MAX_RX_QUEUES)  // Define MAX_RX_QUEUES based on actual allocation size of rx_queues_cfg
        break;

    if (!priv->plat->rx_queues_cfg[queue].use_prio)
        continue;

    prio = priv->plat->rx_queues_cfg[queue].prio;
    stmmac_rx_queue_prio(priv, priv->hw, prio, queue);
}
```  
Alternatively, ensure that `rx_queues_count` never exceeds the allocated size of `rx_queues_cfg`.
