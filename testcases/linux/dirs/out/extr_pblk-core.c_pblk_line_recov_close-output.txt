UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `line->map_bitmap` is `NULL`, passing it to `mempool_free()` violates the precondition that the pointer must be valid. Accessing `NULL` in this manner leads to undefined behavior as per the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw / Potential null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: The logic assumes that `line->map_bitmap` is a valid pointer before calling `mempool_free()`. If `line->map_bitmap` is `NULL`, this results in an invalid operation. There is no safety check (such as an explicit `NULL` check) to prevent such a scenario.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before calling `mempool_free()`, check whether `line->map_bitmap` is `NULL`. Modify the code as follows:
```c
if (line->map_bitmap != NULL) {
    mempool_free(line->map_bitmap, l_mg->bitmap_pool);
}
```
This ensures no undefined behavior or bugs arise from handling a null pointer.
