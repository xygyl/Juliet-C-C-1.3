Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pinctrl-baytrail.c_byt_get_function_groups.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not validate `selector` before using it as an index into the `functions` array. If `selector` is out of bounds for the array, behavior becomes undefined due to out-of-bounds access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: If the `selector` parameter provided exceeds the valid range for the `functions` array, the function can lead to out-of-bounds access. This is logically incorrect and can cause stability issues or security vulnerabilities.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking before accessing `vg->soc_data->functions[selector]`. Ensure that `selector` is less than the number of functions available (`vg->soc_data->num_functions` or equivalent).

Example fix:
```c
if (selector >= vg->soc_data->num_functions) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return an appropriate error code
}
```
