UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The member `name` in `struct qstr` is used as if it were a pointer (`name->name`), but `name` itself is defined as an integer (`int name;`). Accessing `name->name` is invalid and could result in reading or writing to unintended memory causing UB.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The semantic mismatch between the type declaration of `struct qstr` and its actual usage (`name->name` expecting a pointer) causes a logic flaw, ultimately leading to UB. If `struct qstr` is intentionally designed this way, the function cannot use a member access (arrow operator `->`) for an integer. The logic in calling `rpc_call_sync` using this incorrect field would fail.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Modify the `struct qstr` declaration to define `name` as a `char *` pointer instead of an `int` if it is expected to hold a string. Specifically:
```c
struct qstr {
    char *name; // Expected to be a string pointer
    size_t len; // String length
};
```
If `name` is indeed intended to be an integer, revise the way this field is accessed (replace `name->name` with `name.name` or properly handle as an integer).
