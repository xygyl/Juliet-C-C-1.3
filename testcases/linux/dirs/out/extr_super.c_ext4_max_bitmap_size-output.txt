UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential signed integer overflow in expressions like `(1LL << (bits-2))` when `bits-2` becomes large or negative, violating the C standard's rules for signed overflow. Additionally, the shift operation becomes undefined for negative shift counts.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow/Underflow  
Bug Reason: Integer overflow or underflow is possible if the value of `bits` is too small or negative, leading to invalid shifts. This is coupled with logical issues when using such an invalid result in subsequent calculations. Additionally, `bits` is unchecked, so no guarantee is provided for its safety.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Perform a range check on the input parameter `bits` to ensure it falls within a safe range, e.g., `bits >= 10` (to avoid `bits-2 < 0` and ensure the calculations are valid). Avoid shifting by a negative or exceedingly large number of bits. Use unsigned integers where practical to prevent unintended signed behavior.

Example:
```c
if (bits <= 9) {
    // Handle invalid input according to your design (e.g., return an error or limit bounds)
}
upper_limit = (1LL << 48) - 1;
```
Ensure input constraints are documented and consistently validated before using.
