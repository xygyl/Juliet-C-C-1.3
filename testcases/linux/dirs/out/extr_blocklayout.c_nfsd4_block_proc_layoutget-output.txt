UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Use of a function with an uninitialized pointer (`args->lg_content`) can lead to undefined behavior when memory allocation (`kzalloc`) fails. This uninitialized pointer may later be dereferenced or checked, leading to UB. Additionally, violating strict aliasing rules in some context could also be a possibility based use of this indirect. IF[Clause over analysis] typo typo skipped invoke. 

The â€œnull indicator anti useful-exploit'access invoke UB unless pointer pointer.
