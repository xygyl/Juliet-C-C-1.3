UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The division `ref_clk_hz / 1000` might cause undefined behavior if `ref_clk_hz` is zero, as division by zero is undefined in C.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The function does not validate input arguments, and specifically, it does not handle the case where `ref_clk_hz` is zero. This can lead to division by zero and potentially crashing the program at runtime.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `ref_clk_hz` is not zero before performing the division. For example:
```c
if (ref_clk_hz == 0)
    return 0; // Or handle the error appropriately.
```
