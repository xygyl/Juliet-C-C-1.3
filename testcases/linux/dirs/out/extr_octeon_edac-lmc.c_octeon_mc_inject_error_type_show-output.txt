UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit any undefined behavior. The code performs assignments, checks, and string formatting in a defined manner. Pointer dereferencing, control flow, and function calls are within well-defined limits based on the provided code.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function does not handle cases where `pvt->error_type` is neither `1` nor `2` properly. In such cases, it returns `0`, which may be an invalid size for formatted output or unexpected behavior downstream. This could lead the caller of the function to interpret the result erroneously.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a default error message or value to handle cases where `error_type` is other than `1` or `2`. For example:
```c
return sprintf(data, "unknown");
```
