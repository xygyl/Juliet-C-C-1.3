Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_bnad.c_bnad_res_alloc.c

**UB Analysis:**
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit any undefined behavior as per the C standard. Specifically:
- There are no signs of memory access violations (e.g., null pointer dereference or out-of-bounds memory access).
- The loop index and the `res_val_max` bound are of type `u32`, avoiding signed integer overflow.
- The function correctly handles errors by breaking out of the loop using `goto`, ensuring cleanup with `bnad_res_free`.

**Bug Analysis:**
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: In the case of an error during the loop (when `bnad_mem_alloc` returns a non-zero value), the cleanup function `bnad_res_free` is called with `res_val_max` as a parameter instead of the current allocation index `i`. This might lead to attempting to free resources that have never been allocated (beyond index `i`), resulting in improper resource management and potential undefined behavior depending on the implementation of `bnad_res_free`.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

**Fix Suggestion:**  
Modify the call to `bnad_res_free` to ensure only the allocated resources are freed. Replace:  
```c
bnad_res_free(bnad, res_info, res_val_max);
```  
with:  
```c
bnad_res_free(bnad, res_info, i);
```  
This ensures that only resources up to index `i` (those successfully allocated before the error occurred) are freed.
