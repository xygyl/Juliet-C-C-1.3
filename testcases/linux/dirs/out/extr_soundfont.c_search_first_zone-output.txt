UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `get_index()` function is used, but its behavior is not defined in the provided code snippet. If `get_index` returns an invalid or negative index (less than 0), no bounds checking is applied to ensure the index falls within the valid range of `sflist->presets`. Accessing an array with an out-of-bounds index is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: Without verification that the index returned by `get_index()` is within the valid range (e.g., 0 to the size of `sflist->presets` - 1), the function risks accessing memory out of bounds. This could lead to undefined results or a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure the value of `index` is valid before accessing `sflist->presets[index]`. For example:
```c
if (index < 0 || index >= MAX_PRESETS) // Ensure MAX_PRESETS is defined and matches the size of the presets array.
    return NULL;
```  
Ensure that `get_index()` properly calculates valid indices and that `sflist->presets` has a known fixed size. If needed, include explicit comments or documentation about the assumptions related to `get_index()` and its interaction with the `presets` array.
