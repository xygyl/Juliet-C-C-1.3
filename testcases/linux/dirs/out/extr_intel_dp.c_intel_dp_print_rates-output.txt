UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain any undefined behavior according to the C standard. All variables appear to be properly declared and initialized before use. There are no out-of-bounds accesses or operations that violate the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential Stack Overflow  
Bug Reason: The local `str` buffer is declared as `char str[128]`, which might be too large for the stack, particularly in environments with small stack sizes or when this function is called recursively (though recursion is not evident here). This is highlighted by the comment `/* FIXME: too big for stack? */`. If the stack size is insufficient, this could lead to program crashes or undefined behavior due to stack exhaustion.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Allocate the buffer dynamically using `kmalloc` or similar mechanisms, or reduce the size if possible:  
```c
char *str = kmalloc(sizeof(char) * 128, GFP_KERNEL);
if (!str)
    return;
// Existing functionality with 'str'
kfree(str);
```
