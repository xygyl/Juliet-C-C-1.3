Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_wm8996.c_wm8996_get_retune_mobile_enum.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function `wm8996_get_retune_mobile_enum` accesses the array `wm8996->retune_mobile_cfg[block]`, but there is no check to ensure that `block` is within valid bounds for the `retune_mobile_cfg` array. If `block` is negative or exceeds the defined size of the `retune_mobile_cfg` array, this results in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access.
 
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Access
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the value of `block` before using it to index the `retune_mobile_cfg` array, which can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add validation to ensure `block` is within the valid range (e.g., `0 <= block < ARRAY_SIZE(wm8996->retune_mobile_cfg)`) before accessing the array. Return an appropriate error code if `block` is invalid. For example:
```c
if (block < 0 || block >= ARRAY_SIZE(wm8996->retune_mobile_cfg))
    return -EINVAL;  // Or an appropriate error code
```
