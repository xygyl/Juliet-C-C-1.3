UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: It is possible for the function to access out-of-bounds memory on the response buffer when `resp_data_length + 7 > *resp_len`. This violates the memory model as per the C standard. Additionally, there are potential risks of dereferencing pointers such as `occ` without guarantees they are valid and initialized properly (though often context ensures validity).  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory-related bug (potential buffer overflow)  
Bug Reason: The check `(resp_data_length + 7) > *resp_len` correctly identifies an overflow situation, but subsequent code inside the function still uses the `resp` buffer without ensuring that it has a valid size. Specifically, the line `rc = occ_getsram(occ, OCC_SRAM_RSP_ADDR + 8, &resp->data[3], resp_data_length - 1)` could result in an out-of-bounds memory write. Proper handling of the error after the size mismatch check is missing.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a `goto done;` after detecting a size mismatch (`if ((resp_data_length + 7) > *resp_len) { rc = -EMSGSIZE; goto done; }`). Ensure proper handling of the buffer access following the validation, and add additional guarantees that `occ` and related pointers are correctly initialized and checked prior to use. Furthermore, explicitly validate `req_len` and `*resp_len` inputs to ensure they are within the expected bounds.
