UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `di->bm` and `di->chg_info.charger_type` are dereferenced without explicit validation. If `di` is NULL, this results in undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference. Additionally, if `di->bm` is NULL, dereferencing `di->bm->main_safety_tmr_h` or `di->bm->usb_safety_tmr_h` will also cause undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not check whether the input `di` or its members (e.g., `di->bm`) are valid (non-NULL) before dereferencing them. This may lead to a crash if the `di` pointer is passed as NULL or if `di->bm` is NULL due to incomplete initialization or unexpected runtime conditions.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer checks at the beginning of the function, e.g.:  

```c
if (!di) {
    dev_err(NULL, "Null pointer received for 'di'\n");
    return;
}

if (!di->bm) {
    dev_err(di->dev, "Null pointer for 'di->bm', cannot access safety timer\n");
    return;
}
```

This ensures that the function gracefully handles null pointers and prevents undefined behavior from occurring.
