Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_seed.c_byte.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Shifting a `u32` value (32-bit integer) by more than or equal to its bit-width (`n << 3` where `n` >= 4) leads to undefined behavior according to the C standard. The value of `n` is not constrained, so if an invalid `n` is passed (e.g., `n >= 4`), undefined behavior occurs.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: There is no check to ensure that the shift amount does not cause undefined behavior. As a result, when `n` is greater than 3, the **logic mistakenly accesses invalid 8-bit segments or could cause a runtime bug due to undefined behavior**.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a guard to ensure `n` is within a valid range (e.g., `n < 4`) before performing the shift. Example:  
```c
if (n < 4) {
    return x >> (n << 3);
} else {
    return 0; // Handle invalid `n` appropriately.
}
```
