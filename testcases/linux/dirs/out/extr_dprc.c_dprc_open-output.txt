UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit undefined behavior based on the provided code. The operations performed—type casting, header encoding, sending commands, and reading tokens—adhere to safe usage patterns. No signs of undefined behavior such as uninitialized variable use, invalid pointer dereference, or signed integer overflow are detected.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The `mc_io` pointer is passed to `mc_send_command()` without checking if it is `NULL`. If `mc_io` is `NULL`, dereferencing it in `mc_send_command()` could trigger a null pointer dereference and result in a crash. Additionally, the `token` pointer is also not validated before dereferencing to assign the read token. If it is `NULL`, this would result in a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion:
Add validation for input pointers (`mc_io` and `token`) at the start of the function:
```c
if (!mc_io || !token) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return an appropriate error code, e.g., invalid argument
}
```
