### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `snprintf` does not guarantee null-termination if the resulting string exceeds the buffer size. Although the buffer length calculation (`strlen(hub_name) + 8`) appears generous enough for the format string `%s-port%d`, there exists a potential risk if the inputs are unexpected or corrupted, leading to undefined behavior due to potential buffer overreading in the `snprintf` call.  

Additionally, the `kzalloc` allocations are not checked for size validity, and although the memory allocator in Linux would likely handle them safely, there is theoretical risk of UB if it's misused elsewhere.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Leak  
Bug Reason: If `sysfs_add_file_to_group` fails, the allocated `usbport_trig_port` structure's memory for `port_name` is properly freed, but the main `port` structure is leaked. The cleanup at `err_out` misses freeing `port`, leading to a possible memory leak.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Ensure complete cleanup in the error path:
   ```c
   err_free_port_name:
       kfree(port->port_name);
       kfree(port);  // Add this line
   err_free_port:
       kfree(port);
   ```
2. Validate inputs and null-terminate manually after `snprintf` to eliminate edge cases:
   ```c
   snprintf(port->port_name, len, "%s-port%d", hub_name, portnum);
   port->port_name[len - 1] = '\0';  // Force null-termination
   ```
