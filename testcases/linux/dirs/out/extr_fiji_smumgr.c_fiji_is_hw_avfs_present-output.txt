UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior due to signed integer overflow in `1 << ((AVFS_EN_MSB - AVFS_EN_LSB) + 1)` if the value of `AVFS_EN_MSB - AVFS_EN_LSB + 1` exceeds 31 on platforms with 32-bit integers. The behavior of left-shifting by a value greater than or equal to the number of bits in a type is undefined in C.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer overflow leading to logical error  
Bug Reason: The calculation of the `mask` can result in incorrect behavior due to undefined results in the left shift operation. This can lead to faulty masking logic, potentially causing incorrect efuse readings. The expression `1 << ((AVFS_EN_MSB - AVFS_EN_LSB) + 1)` is unsafe when the shift count exceeds the size of an integer in bits.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Use a safer method to compute the mask. For example, use `(UINT32_MAX >> (31 - (AVFS_EN_MSB - AVFS_EN_LSB)))`. This avoids the possibility of undefined behavior caused by excessive left-shifting while computing the mask value.
