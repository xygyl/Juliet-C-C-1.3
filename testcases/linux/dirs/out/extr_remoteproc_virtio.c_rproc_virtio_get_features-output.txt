### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The line `rsc = (void *)rvdev->rproc->table_ptr + rvdev->rsc_offset;` appears to involve pointer arithmetic on a `void *` pointer, which is undefined behavior in C. The C standard does not allow arithmetic operations directly on `void *` pointers because their size is unknown. The use of `table_ptr`, assuming it is `void *`, triggers this UB since the offset does not explicitly cast `table_ptr` to another pointer type like `char *`.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The computation of `rvdev->rproc->table_ptr + rvdev->rsc_offset` depends on undefined behavior, which might lead to incorrect address computation. This could result in returning an invalid pointer or accessing an invalid memory location when later dereferencing `rsc->dfeatures`. This could manifest as incorrect functionality or even a crash depending on the memory layout.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence:
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Explicitly cast `table_ptr` to a compatible pointer type, such as `char *`, before performing pointer arithmetic. For instance:  
```c
rsc = (struct fw_rsc_vdev *)((char *)rvdev->rproc->table_ptr + rvdev->rsc_offset);
```  
This ensures proper pointer arithmetic and removes the undefined behavior associated with `void *`.
