Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hal_com.c_eqNByte.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not check whether `str1` and `str2` are non-NULL before dereferencing them. Dereferencing a NULL pointer is undefined behavior as per the C standard. Additionally, out-of-bounds access could occur if `num` exceeds the actual size of either `str1` or `str2`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference, Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: If either `str1` or `str2` is NULL, dereferencing them will cause undefined behavior and likely crash the program. If `num` exceeds the size of either array, memory outside the bounds of the arrays will be accessed, leading to unpredictable behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add checks to ensure `str1` and `str2` are non-NULL before dereferencing them. Example:  
   ```c
   if (!str1 || !str2)
       return false;
   ```  
2. Ensure that `num` does not exceed the actual size of either array, potentially by adding size parameters to the function or validating `num` before performing the comparison.
