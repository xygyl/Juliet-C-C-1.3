Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fimc-m2m.c_stop_streaming.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function may dereference a potential null pointer `ctx`. The member `drv_priv` from the `vb2_queue` structure is directly assigned to `ctx`, but there's no check to ensure it is non-NULL before dereferencing. This constitutes undefined behavior according to the C standard if `ctx` is NULL.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function could result in a null pointer dereference if the `vb2_queue` struct's `drv_priv` member is NULL. This would cause a crash or unpredictable behavior when member access is attempted via the null pointer, such as `ctx->fimc_dev->pdev->dev`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check at the beginning of the function to validate `ctx`:
```c
if (!ctx) {
    return; // Or handle the error appropriately
}
```
