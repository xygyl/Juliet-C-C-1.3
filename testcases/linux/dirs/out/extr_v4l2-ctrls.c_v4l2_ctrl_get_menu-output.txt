UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The string array `hevc_loop_filter_mode` erroneously includes `"NULL"` as the last valid element instead of a `NULL` pointer, which violates the expected convention of terminating with a null pointer in such arrays. String arrays should end with `NULL` (0 pointer), not a string literal `"NULL"`. Accessing these arrays as pointers may lead to undefined behavior when expecting a `NULL` end marker during traversal or processing.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The incorrect use of the literal `"NULL"` in place of the null pointer (`NULL`) for the `hevc_loop_filter_mode` array could lead to logic errors in code reliant on proper null termination (e.g., code using `NULL` as a sentinel while iterating over this array). This flaw could result in incorrect return values or potential infinite loops if the caller assumes the last element is an actual null pointer.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace the final element `"NULL"` in `hevc_loop_filter_mode` with `NULL` (without quotes). Ensure all arrays terminate with a proper null pointer as the sentinel value.
