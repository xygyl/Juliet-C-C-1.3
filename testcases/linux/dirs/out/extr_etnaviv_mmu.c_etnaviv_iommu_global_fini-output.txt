Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_etnaviv_mmu.c_etnaviv_iommu_global_fini.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The expression `--global->use > 0` modifies `global->use` and evaluates it in the same statement. This can cause undefined behavior due to sequence point rules as per the C standard. The decrement (`--global->use`) and the comparison (`global->use > 0`) are ambiguous in terms of order of execution.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: Decrementing `global->use` in the conditional check `if (--global->use > 0)` modifies the reference count before deciding whether to proceed with cleanup. If other parts of the code rely on the value of `global->use` for synchronization or correctness, prematurely decrementing it could lead to issues with resource management or concurrency bugs.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Separate the decrement operation from the conditional check to ensure well-defined behavior:
```c
global->use--;
if (global->use > 0)
    return;
```
This avoids undefined behavior and ensures the logic is clear and safe.
