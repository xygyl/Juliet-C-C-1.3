UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function potentially uses `coex_dm` and `coex_sta` without verifying whether these pointers are valid and initialized. Since these are used directly (e.g., `coex_dm->wifi_chnl_info`), accessing uninitialized or invalid memory leads to undefined behavior when these global pointers are null or point to invalid memory.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `coex_dm` or `coex_sta` is not initialized before this function executes, any dereference will cause null pointer dereference errors. This type of bug is likely because there is no explicit check for the validity of `coex_dm` and `coex_sta`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to ensure `coex_dm` and `coex_sta` are valid pointers before accessing their members:

```c
if (!coex_dm || !coex_sta) {
    RT_TRACE(rtlpriv, COMP_BT_COEXIST, DBG_LOUD, "[BTCoex], coex_dm or coex_sta is NULL\n");
    return;
}
```
