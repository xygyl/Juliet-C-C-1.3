### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain any undefined behavior. The switch statement appropriately handles all possible cases for `type`, and the default case prevents execution of undefined code logic. There are no dereferences of null or uninitialized pointers, no out-of-bounds array accesses, no violations of strict aliasing rules, and no other triggers of undefined behavior.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The implementation assumes that the `type` variable will always be one of the predefined enum values. However, if an invalid value for `type` is passed from the caller, the default case will produce an error log and return `-EINVAL`. While this is safe, it may indicate a higher-level design flaw where stricter validation of `type` should occur before this function is called. Debugging might be challenging without knowing the source of invalid values.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  

Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the caller of this function validates the `type` parameter to guarantee it is always a valid enum value. Alternatively, replace the integer `type` with a strongly-typed enum to prevent invalid values during compilation.
