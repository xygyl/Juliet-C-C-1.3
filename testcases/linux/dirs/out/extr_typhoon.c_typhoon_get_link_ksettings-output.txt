UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain operations known to invoke undefined behavior under the C standard. The code follows properly defined manipulation of variables, pointer dereferencing (`tp` obtained from `netdev_priv`) appears valid, and any conditionally used variables like `tp->xcvr_select` and `tp->capabilities` are checked before usage. There are no access violations (e.g., out-of-bounds), integer overflows, uninitialized variable usages, or pointer misuse.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The logic defining `supported` assumes fiber capability (`TYPHOON_FIBER`) mutually excludes twisted-pair (`TP`) capabilities, but it incorrectly overwrites possible TP support in the fiber case. If `tp->capabilities` includes both `TYPHOON_FIBER` and TP capabilities simultaneously, support for TP is erroneously excluded from `supported` when fiber is chosen. This could lead to incorrect reporting of supported link modes.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Adjust the assignment of `supported` in the fiber case to *add* rather than overwrite `(SUPPORTED_10baseT_Half | SUPPORTED_10baseT_Full | SUPPORTED_TP)` for configurations with mixed capabilities. For example:
```c
supported |= SUPPORTED_FIBRE;
supported |= SUPPORTED_10baseT_Half | SUPPORTED_10baseT_Full | SUPPORTED_TP;
advertising |= ADVERTISED_FIBRE | ADVERTISED_TP;
cmd->base.port = PORT_FIBRE;
```
This ensures class configurations merge correctly.
