UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow may occur due to operations on `frac` and `exp` variables, as the C standard does not define behavior for signed integer overflow. Additionally, improper type handling (long long being mixed with unsigned long long) may cause undefined behavior in certain contexts though unsigned shifts themselves are well-defined.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow, Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The addition and bit-shift logic performed on `frac` and `exp` can lead to integer overflow, causing potential incorrect operations or unexpected results. Additionally, the function may incorrectly handle edge cases where `iy` is shifted right and becomes too small (losing precision).  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Cast `exp` and `frac` to unsigned types wherever necessary, ensuring arithmetic and bitwise operations do not invoke undefined behavior due to signed overflows.  
2. Introduce checks to validate that operations will not exceed the limits of `long long` or `unsigned long long`.  
3. Account for precision loss when shifting right `iy`. Alternatively, involve types with sufficient precision or range.
