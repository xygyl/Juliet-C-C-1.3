Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_atmel-mci.c_atmci_submit_data_dma.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code assumes that `desc` (host->dma.data_desc) is non-NULL when calling `dmaengine_submit(desc)` if `chan` is non-NULL. Dereferencing a NULL pointer is undefined behavior in C. The function does not explicitly ensure that `desc` is valid before use.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If `host->dma.data_desc` (desc) is NULL, the call to `dmaengine_submit(desc)` will lead to a null pointer dereference at runtime, causing a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL check for `desc` before calling `dmaengine_submit`. The corrected code could look like:
```c
if (chan && desc) {
    dmaengine_submit(desc);
    dma_async_issue_pending(chan);
}
```
