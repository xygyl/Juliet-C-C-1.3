Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_prm33xx.c_am33xx_pwrdm_read_logic_retst.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The shift operation `v >>= __ffs(m);` invokes undefined behavior if `m == 0` because `__ffs` would be called with a zero argument. According to the C standard, shifting by more than the width of the type, or using a zero argument for `__ffs` directly, is undefined.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: A logical error exists because the function does not properly handle the case where `pwrdm->logicretstate_mask == 0`. While it returns `-EINVAL`, it does not protect against potential undefined behavior when `m` is zero later in the function.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add an explicit check or assertion before invoking `__ffs(m)` to ensure that `m != 0`. For example:

```c
if (m == 0)
    return -EINVAL;
```

This prevents invocation of undefined behavior and clarifies the code's intent. Additionally, the earlier check `if (!m)` effectively does the same, so the problematic shift operation should not execute in such scenarios.
