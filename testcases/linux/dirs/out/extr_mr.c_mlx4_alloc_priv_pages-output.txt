Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mr.c_mlx4_alloc_priv_pages.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing the result of `get_zeroed_page` is undefined behavior if the allocation fails, as `mr->pages` will be `NULL`, and operations on `NULL` pointers are undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: When `get_zeroed_page(GFP_KERNEL)` fails, `mr->pages` will be `NULL`. Subsequent operations on `mr->pages` (such as `dma_map_single(device->dev.parent, mr->pages, ...)`) will dereference `NULL`, causing a null-pointer dereference bug if the failure handling in `goto err` is not reached.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for `get_zeroed_page` returning `NULL` immediately after the allocation. If `mr->pages` is `NULL`, return `-ENOMEM` without proceeding further.
