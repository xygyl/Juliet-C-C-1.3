UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code assumes `acpi_gbl_mutex_info[i]` has valid data for indices from `0` to `ACPI_MAX_MUTEX - 1`. If the `acpi_gbl_mutex_info` array is uninitialized or smaller than `ACPI_MAX_MUTEX`, accessing out-of-bounds elements will invoke undefined behavior. Additionally, dereferencing an uninitialized or invalid pointer in the `thread_id` field (if the structure isn't properly initialized) will also lead to undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access (potential)  
Bug Reason: If `acpi_gbl_mutex_info` is incorrectly allocated or its size is smaller than `ACPI_MAX_MUTEX`, accessing beyond its bounds would cause a crash and memory corruption. This would be a significant logic bug. Also, if the `thread_id` field of one of the array elements is not initialized, it could lead to unintended behavior during comparison.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `acpi_gbl_mutex_info` is properly allocated with a size of at least `ACPI_MAX_MUTEX`, and initialize all elements before accessing them. Additionally, check that pointers are not NULL before accessing `thread_id`. Adding runtime bounds checks around `ACPI_MAX_MUTEX` to guarantee array size correctness would improve robustness. Example:

```c
if (!acpi_gbl_mutex_info) {
    acpi_os_printf("Error: Mutex info is not initialized.\n");
    return;
}

for (i = 0; i < ACPI_MAX_MUTEX; i++) {
    if (i >= sizeof(acpi_gbl_mutex_info) / sizeof(acpi_gbl_mutex_info[0])) {
        acpi_os_printf("Error: Array index out of bounds.\n");
        return;
    }
    acpi_os_printf("%26s : %s\n", acpi_ut_get_mutex_name(i),
                   acpi_gbl_mutex_info[i].thread_id ==
                   ACPI_MUTEX_NOT_ACQUIRED ? "Locked" : "Unlocked");
}
```
