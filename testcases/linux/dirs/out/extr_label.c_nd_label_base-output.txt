Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_label.c_nd_label_base.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Pointer arithmetic on `void *` is undefined behavior. The C standard does not support arithmetic directly on `void *` because it is considered an incomplete typeâ€”its size is undefined, and therefore pointer arithmetic on it is not well-defined.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Undefined Behavior-induced Pointer Arithmetic Error  
Bug Reason: The `base` variable is of type `void *`, and the arithmetic `base + 2 * sizeof_namespace_index(ndd)` violates the standard. While some compilers may tolerate this by treating `void *` as `char *`, this behavior relies on non-portable compiler extensions and can lead to unpredicted behavior across different environments or platforms.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Change the type of `base` to `char *` or cast `base` to `char *` before performing pointer arithmetic. For example:  
```c
return (char *)base + 2 * sizeof_namespace_index(ndd);
```
