### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `send` function is called with the assumption that `data + done` always points to valid memory. If `cfg_payload_len` is greater than the allocated or expected size of the `data` buffer, this will result in out-of-bounds access when indexing `data + done`. Out-of-bounds access violates C standards and leads to undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: If `cfg_payload_len` exceeds the allocated size of the `data` buffer, it can cause a buffer overflow. The `send` function attempts to send more data than the buffer might hold, potentially leading to memory corruption. This is a memory-related bug caused by a lack of bounds checking on `cfg_payload_len` prior to accessing `data`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  
The issue arises directly from a fundamental violation of array bounds, which is both UB and a buffer overflow bug in the code logic.

### Fix Suggestion: Add explicit bounds checking for `done` and `cfg_payload_len` before performing the `send` call. Consider passing the size of the `data` buffer explicitly to ensure it cannot be exceeded:
```c
static int send_tcp(int fd, char *data, int data_size)
{
    int ret, done = 0, count = 0;

    while (done < cfg_payload_len) {
        // Ensure we do not exceed buffer size
        if (done + (cfg_payload_len - done) > data_size) {
            error(1, errno, "Buffer overflow risk");
            break;
        }

        ret = send(fd, data + done, cfg_payload_len - done,
                   cfg_zerocopy ? MSG_ZEROCOPY : 0);
        if (ret == -1)
            error(1, errno, "write");

        done += ret;
        count++;
    }

    return count;
}
```
