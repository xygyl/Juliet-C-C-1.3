Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_tnc_commit.c_alloc_idx_lebs.c

### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. The function calls `kmalloc_array()` to allocate memory for `c->ilebs`. However, it does not validate if the `leb_cnt` or `sizeof(int)` multiplication might lead to integer overflow, causing buffer allocation smaller or larger than required, which is undefined behavior.  
2. The return value of `ubifs_find_free_leb_for_idx()` is assigned to `lnum` without proper checking. This could lead to undefined behavior if the function returns specific error codes that are not `lnum` values, and these error codes propagate incorrectly to `c->ilebs`.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory-related bug (Potential Buffer Overflow)  
Bug Reason:  
- If `leb_cnt` is calculated to a value that exceeds the memory limits or causes integer overflow during allocation by `kmalloc_array()`, this could lead to a buffer overflow when accessing `c->ilebs[i]`.  
- A partial allocation failure can occur if `kmalloc_array()` returns NULL due to excessive size, triggering the later dereference of `c->ilebs` in the loop, leading to null pointer dereference.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Before calling `kmalloc_array()`, validate `leb_cnt` to ensure multiplication of `leb_cnt * sizeof(int)` does not overflow:
   ```c
   if (leb_cnt > SIZE_MAX / sizeof(int))
       return -ENOMEM; // Return an error for overflow risk.
   ```

2. Confirm the return value of `ubifs_find_free_leb_for_idx()` and handle it properly:
   ```c
   if (lnum < 0) {
       kfree(c->ilebs);  // Free allocated memory before exiting in error.
       return lnum;
   }
   ```

3. Ensure all memory allocated with `kmalloc_array()` is freed appropriately if an error occurs during subsequent processing.
