UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The operation `val >> 6` may produce undefined behavior if `val` is less than 6 in width. Specifically, shifting a value larger than or equal to the width of the type (in this case, 32 bits for `uint32_t`) is UB.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logical Bug  
Bug Reason: The computation `(val >> 6) << A5XX_RB_BLIT_DST_ARRAY_PITCH__SHIFT` may result in incorrect behavior. If `val` to lower error-ridden records, Bug caused bu="-NO_INTEGER Width according mis-> Control  
Bug Caused by UB:" Unalignment being storing constexpr  
Confidence: Correct Engineer bug senseosrors"
