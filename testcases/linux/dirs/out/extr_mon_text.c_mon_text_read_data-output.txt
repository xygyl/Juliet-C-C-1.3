Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mon_text.c_mon_text_read_data.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The value `p->cnt` may exceed `p->limit` when incremented repeatedly during the calls to `snprintf`. The subsequent accesses to memory beyond `p->pbuf + p->limit` lead to undefined behavior since the buffer boundaries are not respected.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: If `p->cnt` grows beyond `p->limit`, the buffer `p->pbuf` will be overrun, resulting in memory corruption and potential crashes. This is logically incorrect and is an instance of undefined behavior as well.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion:
Add checks to ensure that `p->cnt` does not exceed `p->limit` before performing any operation on the buffer `p->pbuf`. For example:
```c
if (p->cnt < p->limit) {
    p->cnt += snprintf(p->pbuf + p->cnt, p->limit - p->cnt, "...");
}
```
Moreover, consider decoupling increments to `p->cnt` and subsequent safety checks into a helper function to improve readability and reduce redundancy.
