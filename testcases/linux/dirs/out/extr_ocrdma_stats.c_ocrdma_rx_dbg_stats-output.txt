Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_ocrdma_stats.c_ocrdma_rx_dbg_stats.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code potentially accesses out-of-bounds memory at `rx_dbg_stats->data[i]` if `rx_dbg_stats->data` doesn't contain at least 200 elements. The array size is not checked or guaranteed, leading to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Access
Bug Reason: If `rx_dbg_stats->data` doesn't contain 200 elements, the loop will dereference invalid memory, causing an out-of-bounds access bug. This read may lead to crashes or corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `rx_dbg_stats->data` has at least 200 elements before accessing `rx_dbg_stats->data[i]`, or dynamically adjust the loop based on the actual size of the array.
