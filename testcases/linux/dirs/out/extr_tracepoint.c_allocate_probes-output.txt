Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_tracepoint.c_allocate_probes.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The variable `p` in the `kmalloc` function is used ambiguously. It is declared and defined locally as a pointer to `struct tp_probes`, but `struct_size(p, probes, count)` uses it incorrectly since it should reference the structure field `probes`, which causes potential type confusion and incorrect interpretation. The macro `struct_size(p, probes, count)` may access uninitialised memory leading to UB.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: Misuse of the `struct_size` macro due to incorrectly passing `p` before it has been properly allocated and initialized. This likely causes an incorrect calculation of the required size for memory allocation or uninitialized pointer dereference.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
- Use `struct_size(struct tp_probes, probes, count)` directly to correctly calculate the size based on the structure type `struct tp_probes`.
- Correctly handle the allocation inside `kmalloc` or ensure proper initialisation and alignment of variables before usage.

Corrected Code:
```c
static inline void *allocate_probes(int count)
{
    struct tp_probes *p = kmalloc(struct_size(struct tp_probes, probes, count),
                                  GFP_KERNEL);
    return p == NULL ? NULL : p->probes;
}
```
