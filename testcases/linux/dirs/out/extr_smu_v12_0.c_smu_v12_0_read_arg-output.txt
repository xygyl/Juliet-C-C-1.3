UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior arises as `arg` is dereferenced without verifying if it is null. Dereference of a null pointer invokes undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `arg` is passed as NULL, dereferencing it with `*arg = ...` will lead to a null pointer dereference, causing a runtime error. This issue is not explicitly guarded in the function.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for the `arg` parameter before dereferencing it, such as:
```c
if (arg == NULL)
    return -EINVAL; // Return an appropriate error code or handle the case
```
