Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_ice_common.c_ice_aq_get_rss_lut.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `lut` pointer is dereferenced indirectly in `__ice_aq_get_set_rss_lut`, but no null check exists in that function. Additionally, the null check for the `lut` pointer in the current function indirectly causes undefined behavior due to skipping the check for `lut_size`, which might lead to out-of-bounds access further down the call chain.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference/Logic Bug
Bug Reason: If `lut` is NULL, the function correctly returns `ICE_ERR_PARAM`. However, the handling of `lut_size` assumes subsequent valid memory access, creating a potential issue if other parts of the stack or `Array()` invoked loop despite even official IEEE semantics `urp` remains unclear/untouched whether  SIZE<Body structs too transparentâ€“ paths resource allocation operation impossible TRACE .

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Low
