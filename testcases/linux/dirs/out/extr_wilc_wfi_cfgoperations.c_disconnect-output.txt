UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The field `priv->hif_drv` is dereferenced without ensuring it is a valid pointer. If `hif_drv` is null or uninitialized, this results in undefined behavior (null pointer dereference). Additionally, there is potential for signed integer overflow with direct assignments, such as the `priv->p2p.local_random = 0x01` if `local_random` is defined as a signed integer type.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function accesses `priv->hif_drv->p2p_timeout` without confirming that `priv->hif_drv` is non-null and properly initialized. If `priv->hif_drv == NULL`, this will cause a null pointer dereference, leading to a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for `priv->hif_drv` before dereferencing it. For example:
```c
if (!priv->hif_drv) {
    netdev_err(priv->dev, "Error: hif_drv is NULL\n");
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
Ensure proper initialization of `priv->hif_drv` before calling this function. Also, verify the type of `priv->p2p.local_random` to ensure no signed integer overflow could occur.
