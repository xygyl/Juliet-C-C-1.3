Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_wm8350-irq.c_irq_to_wm8350_irq.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code performs an array access via a pointer (`wm8350_irqs[irq - wm8350->irq_base]`). If the computed index `irq - wm8350->irq_base` is out-of-bounds (negative or exceeds the size of `wm8350_irqs`), undefined behavior will occur. Since the size of `wm8350_irqs` and boundary checking is not provided, the code assumes the index is valid, which is unsafe.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: If the value of `irq` is such that `irq - wm8350->irq_base` falls outside the range of valid indices for `wm8350_irqs`, this leads to an out-of-bounds array access, causing memory corruption or runtime errors.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
Add boundary checking before accessing the `wm8350_irqs` array:

```c
if ((irq - wm8350->irq_base) < 0 || (irq - wm8350->irq_base) >= sizeof(wm8350_irqs)/sizeof(wm8350_irqs[0])) {
    return NULL; // or handle error appropriately
}
return &wm8350_irqs[irq - wm8350->irq_base];
```
Ensure that `wm8350_irqs` is properly defined and its size is known to safely validate indices within the range.
