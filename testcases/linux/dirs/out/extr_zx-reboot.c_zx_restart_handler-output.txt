### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code potentially dereferences invalid or misaligned pointers through `base` and `pcu_base`. These scalar variables are used as addresses to write values using the `writel_relaxed` function. If `base` or `pcu_base` is uninitialized or has an invalid value before the function execution, this will result in undefined behavior as per the C standard. Writing to a wrong memory location is UB.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The variables `base` and `pcu_base` are neither initialized nor checked for validity (e.g., being null). If either `base` or `pcu_base` is null, dereferencing them would cause a null pointer dereference, potentially leading to a system crash or other unintended outcomes. Additionally, the same issue could lead to incorrect memory writes if they are pointing to unintended addresses.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:  
Add checks for the validity of `base` and `pcu_base` before using them:
```c
if (!base || !pcu_base) {
    pr_emerg("Invalid base or pcu_base pointer\n");
    return NOTIFY_DONE;
}
```  
This will prevent undefined behavior and null pointer dereference. Proper initialization for these variables should be ensured before invoking `zx_restart_handler`.
