UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences a pointer `image` without verifying whether it is NULL. Dereferencing a NULL pointer is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The `image` pointer passed into the function is dereferenced multiple times without a check for NULL, which could lead to a crash if `image` is NULL.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a check for `image == NULL` at the start of the function. For example:
```c
if (image == NULL) {
    IL_ERR("Image pointer is NULL\n");
    return -EIO;
}
```
