UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code `kmalloc` is used to allocate memory for `rd`, but the code does not adequately check if `rd->list`, `rd->rmem`, or `rd->dev` are accessed after a failed allocation in subsequent logic. If the `ret` variable is not zero, `rd` is freed (`kfree(rd)`), but during error handling, it is dereferenced indirectly. Dereferencing the freed or uninitialized memory could lead to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
