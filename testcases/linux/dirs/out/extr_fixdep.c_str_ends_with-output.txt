### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `sublen > slen`, the expression `(s + slen - sublen)` produces an invalid pointer, which is undefined behavior under the C standard because pointer arithmetic is attempted past the start of valid memory. Although the preceding condition `if (sublen > slen)` prevents execution of `memcmp()` in this case, computing an invalid pointer itself is still considered UB.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: N/A  
Bug Reason: The function correctly handles comparisons and boundaries based on the length of the substring (`sub`). There is no logic flaw, memory-related bug, or other issues in the context of its intended functionality.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
To avoid UB caused by pointer arithmetic, the pointer calculation can be deferred until inside the condition block where it is safe. For example:
```c
static int str_ends_with(const char *s, int slen, const char *sub)
{
    int sublen = strlen(sub);

    if (sublen > slen)
        return 0;

    const char *end = s + slen - sublen;  // Valid pointer computation after check.
    return !memcmp(end, sub, sublen);
}
```
