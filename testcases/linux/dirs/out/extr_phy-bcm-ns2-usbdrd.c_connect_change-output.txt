### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Dereferencing potential null pointers:** The function accesses `driver->data`, `driver->icfgdrd_regs` and `driver->usb2h_strap_reg` without ensuring that `driver` and its members are non-NULL. Dereferencing a NULL pointer results in undefined behavior.  
2. **Possible misaligned memory access:** Reads and writes (`readl` and `writel`) rely on the assumption that `icfgdrd_regs` and `usb2h_strap_reg` are properly aligned pointers pointing to valid hardware registers. If this assumption is violated, behavior is undefined as the operations may cause hardware faults.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference, Invalid memory access  
Bug Reason:  
- The code does not check if `driver` or its members (`driver->icfgdrd_regs`, `driver->usb2h_strap_reg`, `driver->data`) are valid before usage. Passing an improperly initialized or NULL `driver` object or its fields will cause runtime crashes or undefined behavior when dereferenced.  
- There is no validation for the `new_state` value in `driver->data` before interpreting it via the switch-case. An undetected bad value can lead to the `default` case.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Add null pointer checks for `driver`, `driver->data`, `driver->icfgdrd_regs`, and `driver->usb2h_strap_reg` at the beginning of the function:
   ```c
   if (!driver || !driver->data || !driver->icfgdrd_regs || !driver->usb2h_strap_reg) {
       pr_err("Invalid driver object\n");
       return;
   }
   ```
2. Validate the `new_state` value in `driver->data` to ensure it only contains valid enumerators:
   ```c
   if (driver->data->new_state != EVT_DEVICE && driver->data->new_state != EVT_HOST) {
       pr_err("Invalid new_state value\n");
       return;
   }
   ```
