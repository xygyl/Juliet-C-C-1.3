UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior due to unvalidated use of fields in the `native_mode` structure, which might be uninitialized or corrupted when accessed. Accessing uninitialized memory is undefined behavior, and there is no apparent validation or initialization of the fields such as `htotal`, `hdisplay`, `vtotal`, etc. Additionally, arithmetic on unsigned integers (e.g., subtraction in `native_mode->htotal - native_mode->hdisplay`) may produce incorrect results if the subtraction results in a negative value and an unsigned type is used implicitly.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Use of uninitialized variables  
Bug Reason: Fields in `native_mode` might be uninitialized or contain invalid values due to lack of initialization or validation before use. This can lead to incorrect or nonsensical calculations being performed, which propagate into the `adjusted_mode` structure.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that all fields of `native_mode` are initialized and valid before performing any arithmetic operations. Add initialization or validation code to confirm that the structure has valid values. Alternatively, pre-checks could validate data integrity before using the fields to avoid UB and logic issues.
