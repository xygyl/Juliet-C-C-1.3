Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mmu.c_block_size.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The expression `ffs(base)` and `fls(top - base)` return 0 when `base` or `top - base` is zero, which leads to a signed integer overflow in `(ffs(base) - 1)` or `(fls(top - base) - 1)` (undefined behavior in C). Additionally, indirect shifts of 1 by large values (e.g., `1U << base_shift` and `1U << block_shift` when `block_shift` exceeds 31) could yield undefined behavior due to out-of-range bitwise shifts.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: If `base` is zero or `top` equals `base`, the calculation of `block_shift` and subsequently `block_size` could fail due to incorrect shift operations. This could result in unintended behavior or incorrect output.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add validation checks for `base` and `(top - base)` at the beginning of the function to ensure they are non-zero and within reasonable ranges before performing the `ffs()` and `fls()` calculations. Also, clamp the shift values (`base_shift` and `block_shift`) to a maximum of 31 to avoid undefined behavior in the shift operations.

Example Fix:
```c
static unsigned int block_size(unsigned long base, unsigned long top)
{
    if (base == 0 || top <= base) {
        // Handle invalid inputs or return a default value
        return 0;
    }

    unsigned int max_size = IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PPC_BOOK3S_601) ? SZ_8M : SZ_256M;
    unsigned int base_shift = (ffs(base) - 1) & 31;
    unsigned int block_shift = (fls(top - base) - 1) & 31;

    // Clamp base_shift and block_shift to a maximum of 31 to prevent UB in shift operations
    base_shift = base_shift > 31 ? 31 : base_shift;
    block_shift = block_shift > 31 ? 31 : block_shift;

    return min3(max_size, 1U << base_shift, 1U << block_shift);
}
