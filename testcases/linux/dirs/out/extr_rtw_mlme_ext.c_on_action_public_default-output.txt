UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: 
1. Potential out-of-bounds access in `frame_body[2]`. If `frame_body` does not have at least 3 bytes (i.e., `frame_len` is less than `sizeof(struct ieee80211_hdr_3addr) + 3`), accessing `frame_body[2]` results in undefined behavior due to reading beyond allocated bounds.
2. The `sprintf` call does not perform bounds checking on `msg`. If the calculated content exceeds the size of the `msg` buffer (64 bytes), it leads to undefined behavior due to buffer overflow.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds read and buffer overflow
Bug Reason: 
1. Out-of-bounds read occurs when `frame_body[2]` is accessed without verifying its length.
2. Buffer overflow may occur in the `sprintf` call if the concatenated string exceeds the buffer's allocated size (64 bytes).

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
1. Add bounds checking for `frame_body` before accessing `frame_body[2]`. For example:
   ```c
   if (frame_len < sizeof(struct ieee80211_hdr_3addr) + 3)
       goto exit; // Avoid accessing out of bounds
   ```
2. Use `snprintf` instead of `sprintf` for writing to `msg` to ensure no buffer overflows occur. For example:
   ```c
   cnt += snprintf((msg+cnt), sizeof(msg) - cnt, "%s(token:%u)", action_public_str(action), token);
   ```
