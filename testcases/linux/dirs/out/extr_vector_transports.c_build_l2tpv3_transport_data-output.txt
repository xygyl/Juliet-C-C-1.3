UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not perform operations that result in undefined behavior according to the C standard. All pointer allocations are checked for NULL, variables used in memory manipulation are initialized, and integer-to-pointer conversions are not present. Additionally, there is no evidence of signed integer overflow, null pointer dereference, uninitialized variable access, or strict aliasing violations.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function verifies parameter existence (`get_uint_param` and `get_ulong_param`) before extracting their contents. However, the "cookie" initialization logic is inconsistent â€” if `rx_cookie` or `tx_cookie` retrieval fails individually, further conditions could be skipped, leading to an uninitialized or partially initialized `td->cookie` flag. This can cause downstream logic errors wherever the `td->cookie` flag is expected to be completely set or unset given specific combinations of input flags.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Before marking `td->cookie = true;`, verify that both `rx_cookie` and `tx_cookie` parameters are successfully retrieved individually. Avoid silently skipping control flow when a failure occurs in retrieving cookies. Instead, explicitly notify the calling logic about invalid parameter combinations.
