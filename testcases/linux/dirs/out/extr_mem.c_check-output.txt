Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mem.c_check.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Signed Integer Overflow**: The function performs addition operations with the variable `n`, which could lead to undefined behavior due to overflow if `n` exceeds the maximum value an `int` can hold. Any signed integer overflow is undefined behavior in C.  
2. **Buffer Overflow**: The `perf_mem__lvl_scnprintf` function writes to `out` based on the value of `n`. If `n` or `sizeof out - n` is not properly bounded, there could be out-of-bounds memory access, which is undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason:  
1. `perf_mem__lvl_scnprintf` does not guarantee that it will respect the remaining size of `out` (calculated as `sizeof out - n`). If `n` is not correctly updated or bounded, this can lead to a buffer overflow and possibly corrupt memory outside the `out` array.
2. Lack of bounds-checking in this function creates a scenario where modifying `out` with subsequent calls can overwrite memory outside the allocated array.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
- Ensure that `n` does not exceed the bounds of `out`. Use explicit bounds-checking before performing the addition operations and in subsequent calls to `perf_mem__snp_scnprintf` and `perf_mem__lvl_scnprintf`.  
- Replace `int n` with `size_t n` to prevent signed integer overflow and to ensure portability.  
- Add bounds validation after every function call that modifies `out` (`perf_mem__lvl_scnprintf`, `perf_mem__snp_scnprintf`) to verify the remaining buffer size before proceeding.
