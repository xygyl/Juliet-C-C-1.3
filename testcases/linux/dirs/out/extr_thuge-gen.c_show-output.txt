Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_thuge-gen.c_show.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The behavior is undefined if `snprintf()` is used to write beyond the buffer `buf` due to an overly large string format or incorrect size calculations. Additionally, `getpagesize()` is a POSIX function that might not work uniformly across different platforms if platform considerations are not accounted for.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: There is potential for a buffer overflow in `snprintf()` if the formatted string exceeds 100 bytes (length of `buf`). This can occur if `ps >> 10` results in a very large value or if unintended large inputs are processed.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure the string passed to `snprintf()` is correctly dimensioned by adding pre-emptive size checks for `ps`. Alternatively, use a safer approach for handling dynamic strings, such as dynamically allocated buffers with size validations or bounds-checking mechanisms within `snprintf()`.
