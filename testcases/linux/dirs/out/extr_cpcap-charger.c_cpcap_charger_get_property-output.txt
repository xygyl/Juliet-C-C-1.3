### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Potential Null Pointer Dereference**: The `dev_get_drvdata` function dereferences `psy->dev.parent` to access the driver data. If `psy` or `psy->dev.parent` is `NULL`, the dereferencing operation results in undefined behavior. However, the code does not appear to have any explicit checks ensuring `psy` or `psy->dev.parent` is non-NULL before use.  
2. **Arithmetic Overflow Risk**: Multiplying the voltage and current by 1000 in `POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_VOLTAGE_NOW` and `POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_CURRENT_NOW` could theoretically lead to integer overflow if the values from `cpcap_charger_get_charge_voltage` or `cpcap_charger_get_charge_current` are sufficiently large. Given the lack of explicit checks or constraints on the return values, this operation could lead to UB.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference; Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason:  
1. **Null Pointer Dereference**: If `psy` or `psy->dev.parent` is `NULL`, calling `dev_get_drvdata(psy->dev.parent)` causes a null pointer dereference, leading to a runtime error. There are no checks to safeguard `psy` or its members before use.  
2. **Integer Overflow**: Multiplying the return values of `cpcap_charger_get_charge_voltage` and `cpcap_charger_get_charge_current` by 1000 could overflow the `intval` field in `union power_supply_propval`, which is of type `int`. Large values could result in unintended results due to modular arithmetic.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes

### Confidence: High  
The undefined behavior risks and potential bugs are straightforward and directly tied to the lack of necessary safety checks for null pointers and integer boundaries.

### Fix Suggestion:  
1. **Null Pointer Check**:  
   Add sanity checks at the start of the function:  
   ```c
   if (!psy || !psy->dev.parent)
       return -EINVAL;
   ```

2. **Integer Overflow Protection**:  
   Ensure that the multiplication does not exceed the range of `int`:  
   ```c
   int voltage = cpcap_charger_get_charge_voltage(ddata);
   if (voltage > INT_MAX / 1000)
       return -EINVAL; // Avoid overflow
   val->intval = voltage * 1000;

   int current = cpcap_charger_get_charge_current(ddata);
   if (current > INT_MAX / 1000)
       return -EINVAL; // Avoid overflow
   val->intval = current * 1000;
   ```

3. **Error Handling** (Optional):   
   Introduce error codes or check the return values of `cpcap_charger_get_charge_voltage` and `cpcap_charger_get_charge_current` in case they inherently fail under certain conditions.
