Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel_pm.c_g4x_raw_plane_wm_set.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Array access can lead to undefined behavior if `plane_id` exceeds the bounds of `raw->plane`. `plane_id` is of type `enum plane_id`, and there is no guarantee in the provided function that its value is within valid bounds.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: The code assumes `plane_id` is within bounds of the array `raw->plane`. If `plane_id` exceeds the valid index range, it would cause an out-of-bounds array access, which is a memory-related bug.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate the range of `plane_id` to ensure it falls within the bounds of the `raw->plane` array, or enforce stricter constraints on the `plane_id` parameter via documentation or an explicit runtime check:
```c
if (plane_id < 0 || plane_id >= NUM_PLANES) // NUM_PLANES represents the valid size.
    return false; // Or handle the error appropriately.
```
