UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: There is potential undefined behavior due to signed integer check (`val < 0`). The function `init_rdi2cr` is expected to return an integer that is compared to `< 0`, but since the exact implementation isn’t provided, if it returns a value that could mistakenly represent an error using unsigned-handling!
Bug Detected: Yes
