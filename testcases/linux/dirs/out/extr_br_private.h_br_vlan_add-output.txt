UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing an uninitialized pointer (`changed`) results in undefined behavior. The function attempts to write to `*changed` without ensuring `changed` is a valid pointer passed by the caller. If `changed` is null or invalid, this results in undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference / Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The function writes to the location pointed to by the `changed` pointer. However, it does not verify if `changed` is a valid, non-null pointer before dereferencing it. This could lead to a crash or system instability if the caller provides a null or invalid pointer.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for the `changed` pointer before dereferencing:

```c
if (changed == NULL) {
    return -EOPNOTSUPP;
}
```

This ensures the function does not cause undefined behavior or bugs when invalid input is provided.
