Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel_display.c_intel_release_load_detect_pipe.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `old->restore_state` pointer is dereferenced without verifying the validity of the pointer (e.g., checking if it is `NULL`). If `old` is invalid or uninitialized, dereferencing `old->restore_state` leads to undefined behavior. Additionally, the `state` pointer passed to `drm_atomic_helper_commit_duplicated_state` might cause UB if the function accesses uninitialized or invalid data.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The same `old->restore_state` pointer is not checked for `NULL` before passing it as an argument to `drm_atomic_helper_commit_duplicated_state`. This may cause a crash if the pointer is `NULL` or invalid.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for the validity of `old` and `old->restore_state` before using them. For example:  
```c
if (!old || !old->restore_state) {
    DRM_DEBUG_KMS("Invalid load detect pipe state\n");
    return;
}
```
