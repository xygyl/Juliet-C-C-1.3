Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_smb2pdu.c_SMB2_QFS_info.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Pointer arithmetic without bounds checking on `rsp`, specifically:  
```c
info = (struct smb2_fs_full_size_info *)(
    le16_to_cpu(rsp->OutputBufferOffset) + (char *)rsp);
```
If `OutputBufferOffset` in `rsp` exceeds the size of the allocated memory buffer pointed to by `rsp`, this results in out-of-bounds pointer access, which is undefined behavior. There are no checks verifying `OutputBufferOffset`'s validity against the size of the response buffer.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Pointer Access  
Bug Reason: The computation of `info` relies on the unchecked `OutputBufferOffset` field in the SMB message. If this offset is incorrect or maliciously crafted, the pointer computation could point to an invalid or inaccessible memory region, potentially causing a crash or other runtime instability.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before performing pointer arithmetic to derive `info`, validate that `OutputBufferOffset` remains within the bounds of the response buffer size, and ensure that the pointer computation doesnâ€™t exceed the allocated memory region. For example:  
```c
if (le16_to_cpu(rsp->OutputBufferOffset) + sizeof(struct smb2_fs_full_size_info) > response_buffer_size) {
    rc = -EINVAL;  // return an appropriate error code
    goto qfsinf_exit;
}
```
