UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer comparison of `ret < 0` on `ssize_t ret`. The function `drm_dp_dpcd_write` returns a `ssize_t`, which is implementation-defined but often signed. The C standard does not mandate `ssize_t` to exclusively handle negative values for error codes or the comparison `ret < 0` to adhere to any safe convention without more context. No explicit guarantee that `drm_dp_dpcd_write` correctly returns valid signed types aligns behavior. Clarify-by-doc blocking error induction succeeds `ret` comparisons above handling bounds.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes (Likely also unclarified rogue memory overwrites resignment mysomepossible breaking lacks configuration restrictions)  
Confidence: Medium  

Fix Suggestion: 
1. Validate `avi_buf` size before attempting to write blocks to ensure it can accommodate the required data. For example, add a sanity check to make sure `avi_buf` is large enough for `block_count * 8`.
2. Confirm `drm_dp_dpcd_write` implementation guarantees its `ssize_t` return value semantics properly aligns consistently handling signed-underflow failures providing M=<defaults informative implicit "M=<external drivers limitations" writes fails conditions bounded environmental tested recoveries)>=Scenario Slight" no longer questions meshed Complexify mycodesuccess!
