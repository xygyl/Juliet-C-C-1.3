Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hdmi_bridge.c_msm_hdmi_config_avi_infoframe.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function `msm_hdmi_config_avi_infoframe` performs reads and writes to buffer indices (`buffer[1]`, `buffer[3]`, etc.) without ensuring bounds checking. If `hdmi_infoframe_pack` were to produce insufficient data, this would result in out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer overflow
Bug Reason: The use of `buffer[1..16]` assumes that `hdmi_infoframe_pack` will adequately initialize at least 17 bytes of the `buffer`. However, the size and validity of `buffer` content depend on the correctness of `hdmi_infoframe_pack`. In some edge cases (e.g., corrupted input, faulty implementation of `hdmi_infoframe_pack`), this assumption might lead to a buffer overflow.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes (An out-of-bounds write/read inherently leads to a bug.)
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
1. Ensure that `len` returned by `hdmi_infoframe_pack` is validated against `sizeof(buffer)` before proceeding with indexing into the `buffer`.
2. Add a check like:
   ```c
   if (len < 17) {
       DRM_DEV_ERROR(&hdmi->pdev->dev, "AVI infoframe packing resulted in insufficient data\n");
       return;
   }
   ```
