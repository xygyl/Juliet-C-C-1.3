Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_88pm860x_charger.c_stop_charge.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `stop_charge` dereferences members (e.g., `info->dev`, `info->i2c`) of the `info` pointer without validating whether `info` is NULL. Dereferencing a NULL pointer results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If the `info` pointer passed to `stop_charge` is NULL, accessing `info->dev`, `info->i2c`, or `info->online` will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a potential crash.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to validate whether `info` is NULL before accessing its members:
```c
if (!info)
    return;
```
