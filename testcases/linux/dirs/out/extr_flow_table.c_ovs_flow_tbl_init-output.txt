### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain any operations that violate the C standard, such as signed integer overflow, null pointer dereferencing (all pointers are explicitly checked for allocation failures), or accessing uninitialized objects. `rcu_assign_pointer` and `table_instance_alloc` are assumed to be valid functions, and the dereference/read/write of memory complies with alignment and aliasing rules.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Leak  
Bug Reason: If `table_instance_alloc(TBL_MIN_BUCKETS)` fails during the allocation of `ufid_ti`, the previously allocated pointer `ti` is correctly cleaned up via `__table_instance_destroy(ti);`. However, there is no cleanup logic for any possibly allocated resources tied to `table->ufid_ti` or `table->ti` at a higher level. This can lead to potential memory leaks if errors occur pre-init.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
- Before returning `-ENOMEM` in the error path, ensure that all memory associated with the flow table and its fields (e.g., `table->ti` and `table->ufid_ti`) is properly cleaned up.
- Alternatively, encapsulate the logic for cleanup into a shared "destroy_table" function that can handle all flow table pointers, using reference counting, so that partial initialization does not leave dangling memory allocations.
