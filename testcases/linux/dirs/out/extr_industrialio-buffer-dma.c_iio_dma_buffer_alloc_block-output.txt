Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_industrialio-buffer-dma.c_iio_dma_buffer_alloc_block.c

### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The code does not exhibit signs of undefined behavior. Memory allocation checks are present (`kzalloc` and `dma_alloc_coherent` return checks). Pointer initialization and usage seem correct, and no suspicious operations violate the C standard, such as dereferencing null pointers or signed integer overflow.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory leak  
Bug Reason: If `dma_alloc_coherent` fails, the function frees `block` using `kfree`. However, no cleanup is performed for resources associated with `queue->buffer`, even though `iio_buffer_get(&queue->buffer)` may increment the reference count or initialize resources earlier in the function. If `dma_alloc_coherent` fails, this could lead to a resource leak associated with `queue->buffer`.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Add cleanup logic for `queue->buffer` in the failure path where `dma_alloc_coherent` fails:
```c
if (!block->vaddr) {
    iio_buffer_put(&queue->buffer);  // Decrement reference count or cleanup buffer resources
    kfree(block);
    return NULL;
}
```
Ensure that the function `iio_buffer_put` is implemented to properly handle the reverse operation of `iio_buffer_get`.
