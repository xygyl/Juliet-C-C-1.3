Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_wm8991.c_wm8991_hw_params.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The call to `params_width(params)` is made without verifying if `params` is a non-NULL pointer. If `params` is NULL, this will cause undefined behavior due to dereferencing a NULL pointer inside `params_width()`.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not check if `params` is NULL prior to calling `params_width()`. This could lead to a crash at runtime if the function is called with a NULL `params` argument.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Introduce a null pointer check for `params` at the beginning of the function. For example:
```c
if (!params) {
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
This ensures the function gracefully handles a NULL `params` input instead of invoking undefined behavior or crashing.
