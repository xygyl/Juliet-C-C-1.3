UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing `ch->cfg->chan` without confirming that `ch->cfg` is non-NULL could lead to undefined behavior (dereferencing a NULL pointer).  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `ch->cfg` is NULL, dereferencing `ch->cfg->chan` will lead to a runtime crash, resulting in a null pointer dereference. The code does not validate `ch->cfg` for NULL before accessing its members. Additionally, accessing `ch->info` without checking for NULL could be problematic depending on code assumptions.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `ch->cfg` and `ch->info` are non-NULL before dereferencing their members. For example:
```c
if (!ch->cfg) {
    return -EINVAL; // Or an appropriate error code
}

if (!ch->info) {
    return -EINVAL; // Or an appropriate error code
}
```
This will prevent the undefined behavior and potential bugs associated with null pointer dereferencing.
