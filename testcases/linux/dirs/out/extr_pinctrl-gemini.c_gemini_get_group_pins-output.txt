Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pinctrl-gemini.c_gemini_get_group_pins.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing elements beyond the bounds of the `gemini_3512_pin_groups` or `gemini_3516_pin_groups` arrays when `selector` is out of bounds. The arrays' size is not checked against the `selector` value, which can lead to undefined behavior (e.g., invalid memory reads or writes).  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds Access  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate that `selector` falls within the valid range of indices for the `gemini_3512_pin_groups` and `gemini_3516_pin_groups` arrays. This could result in accessing memory outside these arrays, leading to undefined behavior and potential crashes or corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking for the `selector` before it is used to index into `gemini_3512_pin_groups` or `gemini_3516_pin_groups`. For instance:
```c
if ((pmx->is_3512 && selector >= ARRAY_SIZE(gemini_3512_pin_groups)) ||
    (pmx->is_3516 && selector >= ARRAY_SIZE(gemini_3516_pin_groups))) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return an error code for invalid selector
}
```
This ensures the `selector` is within valid limits before dereferencing pointers in the arrays.
