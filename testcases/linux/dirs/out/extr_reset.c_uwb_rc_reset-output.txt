Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_reset.c_uwb_rc_reset.c
UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function appears to use valid and safe operations within the constraints of the C standard. There is no observable signed integer overflow, null pointer dereference, uninitialized variable usage, or strict aliasing violation. Allocation with `kzalloc` ensures proper initialization, and the dereferencing of mutex and command pointers is safeguarded with checks.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Leak
Bug Reason: If `uwb_rc_cmd()` fails (returns `result < 0`), the allocated memory for `cmd` (via `kzalloc`) is not freed before returning. This results in a memory leak when an error occurs during the command execution.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
Add `kfree(cmd);` before returning from the function when `uwb_rc_cmd()` fails:
```c
if (result < 0) {
    kfree(cmd);
    goto error_cmd;
}
```
