Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_strparser.c_strp_abort_strp.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function contains potential undefined behavior due to the negation of an integer passed as an argument to set `sk->sk_err`. If `err` is passed as `INT_MIN`, negating it (`-err`) invokes signed integer overflow, which is undefined behavior by the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason: If `err` is `INT_MIN`, negating it (`-err`) results in signed integer overflow. This is both UB and a bug because it violates integer arithmetic rules, and the resulting value of `sk->sk_err` will be incorrect.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before setting `sk->sk_err` to `-err`, check if `err` is equal to `INT_MIN`. If so, either handle it differently or use unsigned integers where such overflow is well-defined as wraparound.
