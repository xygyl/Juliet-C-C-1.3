UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not invoke undefined behavior in its current form. It checks the `connector_signal` member of the `dc_link` struct against `SIGNAL_TYPE_VIRTUAL` before performing an operation (`program_hpd_filter`), and this logic does not violate the C standard. There are no operations like dereferencing null pointers, out-of-bounds array access, or signed integer overflows in the provided code snippet.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether the `link` pointer is `NULL` before accessing its `connector_signal` member. If this function is called with a `NULL` pointer for `link`, accessing `link->connector_signal` will result in undefined behavior and a crash due to dereferencing a null pointer. There may be additional context in the larger code base that ensures `link` is non-NULL, but no such guarantee is visible in the snippet itself.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check at the beginning of the function:  
```c
if (link == NULL) {
    return; // Or handle the error appropriately
}
```
