Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_deftree.c_scan_tree.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The array `s->bl_tree` is indexed with `curlen`, which originates from `tree[n].Len`. However, there is no validation ensuring that `curlen` corresponds to a valid index within the bounds of the array `bl_tree`. Accessing out-of-bounds elements constitutes undefined behavior in C.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: The lack of validation for `curlen` allows potential access beyond the bounds of the `bl_tree` array, leading to memory corruption or crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `curlen` is validated to be within the bounds of the array `bl_tree` (e.g., verify that `curlen` is less than the size of `bl_tree` before using it as an index).
