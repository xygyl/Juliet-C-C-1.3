Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cfg80211.c_mwifiex_cfg80211_init_p2p_go.c

**UB Analysis:**

UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not perform any operations that explicitly result in undefined behavior as per the C standard:
  - The variables used (`mode`) are properly initialized before usage.
  - No signed integer arithmetic is performed that could lead to overflow.
  - The `mwifiex_cfg80211_deinit_p2p()` and `mwifiex_send_cmd()` functions may introduce undefined behavior depending on their definitions, but based on the given code snippet, no UB is present.

**Bug Analysis:**

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: If any of the `mwifiex_send_cmd()` calls fail (return a non-zero value), the function will immediately return `-1` but doesn't reset or clean up resource allocations made during previous steps (e.g., deinitializing P2P mode or other partially set configurations). This could lead to inconsistent state within `mwifiex_private`. Additionally, any failure in `mwifiex_cfg80211_deinit_p2p()` is not logged or properly traced, complicating debugging.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:
- Add proper error handling and cleanup to restore the initial state if any step fails. Log error reasons for debugging purposes.
- For example:
```c
if (mwifiex_cfg80211_deinit_p2p(priv)) {
    printk(KERN_ERR "Failed to deinit P2P mode\n");  // Example logging
    return -1;
}

mode = P2P_MODE_DEVICE;
if (mwifiex_send_cmd(priv, HostCmd_CMD_P2P_MODE_CFG,
                     HostCmd_ACT_GEN_SET, 0, &mode, true)) {
    printk(KERN_ERR "Failed to set P2P_MODE_DEVICE\n");
    // Ensure proper cleanup or reset if needed
    return -1;
}

mode = P2P_MODE_GO;
if (mwifiex_send_cmd(priv, HostCmd_CMD_P2P_MODE_CFG,
                     HostCmd_ACT_GEN_SET, 0, &mode, true)) {
    printk(KERN_ERR "Failed to set P2P_MODE_GO\n");
    // Cleanup logic
    return -1;
}
```
