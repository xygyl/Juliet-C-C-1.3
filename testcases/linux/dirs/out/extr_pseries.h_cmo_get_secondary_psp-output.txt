Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pseries.h_cmo_get_secondary_psp.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The variable `CMO_SecPSP` is accessed but has not been explicitly defined or initialized within this file. Since its value or definition is unknown, accessing it leads to undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: Without initialization or definition of `CMO_SecPSP`, the return value of the function is indeterminate, which results in potential logic errors where unexpected values may propagate throughout the program.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `CMO_SecPSP` is defined and initialized in a manner visible to this function within the file or an included header. For instance:
```c
#define CMO_SecPSP <valid_value>
```
Alternatively, ensure its initialization occurs before this function is called.
