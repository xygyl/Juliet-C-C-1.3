UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code dereferences a pointer (`coex_sta`) without checking if it is `NULL`. If `coex_sta` is ever uninitialized or set to `NULL`, accessing its member `pop_event_cnt` will lead to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `coex_sta` is `NULL`, accessing `coex_sta->pop_event_cnt` will lead to a null pointer dereference. Additionally, this operation does not guard against invalid or uninitialized memory, making it unsafe.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before dereferencing the `coex_sta` pointer, add a check:

```c
if (coex_sta == NULL) {
    // Handle the error or initialize coex_sta
    return;
}
```
Alternatively, ensure `coex_sta` is always initialized appropriately before calling this function.
