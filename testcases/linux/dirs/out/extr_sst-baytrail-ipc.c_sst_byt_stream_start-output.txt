Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sst-baytrail-ipc.c_sst_byt_stream_start.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function implicitly passes the address of a local variable (`start_stream`, a stack-allocated structure) to a member (`request.data`). If the function returns and the asynchronous `sst_ipc_tx_message_nowait` accesses this address, it may cause undefined behavior due to accessing invalid memory.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Use-after-scope (Invalid memory access)
Bug Reason: The `request.data` is populated with the address of a local stack-allocated variable (`start_stream`). Since the message transmission (`sst_ipc_tx_message_nowait`) may happen asynchronously, the local variable could go out of scope, leading to use-after-scope bugs.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Allocate the `start_stream` structure dynamically (e.g., using `malloc`) or ensure that the `sst_ipc_tx_message_nowait` function completes its operation synchronously before the function `sst_byt_stream_start` returns. If allocation is made dynamically, ensure proper deallocation after the message transaction completes to prevent memory leaks.
