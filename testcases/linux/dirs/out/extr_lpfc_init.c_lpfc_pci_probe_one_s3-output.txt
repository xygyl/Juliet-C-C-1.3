Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_lpfc_init.c_lpfc_pci_probe_one_s3.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `intr_mode` variable is used in an uninitialized while-loop condition (`while (true)`), which could lead to unpredictable behavior. Signed integer arithmetic appears safe, and no dereferencing of null pointers occurs in the code provided.
Bug Detected: Error likely no invalid allocation routines + invalid intr Vector test atleast in this PCI Module intended!
