### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit any behavior specifically classified as undefined by the C standard. It avoids common undefined behaviors such as signed integer overflow, null pointer dereferences, uninitialized variable usage, out-of-bounds memory access, violating strict aliasing rules, and misaligned memory accesses. Additionally, type usage aligns with the constraints of the C standard.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The check `if (adjusted_mode->flags & DRM_MODE_FLAG_DBLSCAN)` returns `-EINVAL` (error code) when a double-scan mode is requested, but there is no early return following this check (as with `DRM_MODE_FLAG_INTERLACE` and `DRM_MODE_FLAG_DBLCLK`). The absence of early return may cause unintended behavior where subsequent function calls (e.g., `intel_dp_compute_link_config`) are executed despite an invalid mode. This inconsistency breaks the expected logic and might lead to undefined or incorrect configuration outcomes in such scenarios.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add an `early return` after the check `if (adjusted_mode->flags & DRM_MODE_FLAG_DBLSCAN)` like with the other flag checks to ensure consistency:

```c
if (adjusted_mode->flags & DRM_MODE_FLAG_DBLSCAN)
    return -EINVAL;
```

This way, the function halts execution immediately upon detecting a double-scan mode, ensuring proper error handling.
