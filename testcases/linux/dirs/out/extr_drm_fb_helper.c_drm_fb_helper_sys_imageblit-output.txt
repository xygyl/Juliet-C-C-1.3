Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_drm_fb_helper.c_drm_fb_helper_sys_imageblit.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Possible null pointer dereference. The `info` parameter is dereferenced in both `sys_imageblit` and `drm_fb_helper_dirty` functions without any validation. If `info` is `NULL`, this leads to undefined behavior. Similarly, the `image` parameter is accessed without checking if it is `NULL`â€”if `image` is `NULL`, accessing its members (`dx`, `dy`, `width`, `height`) results in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: Both `info` and `image` are used without validation for null values. This could lead to runtime errors if either pointer is `NULL`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer checks for `info` and `image` at the beginning of the `drm_fb_helper_sys_imageblit` function. For example:
```c
if (info == NULL || image == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
