UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The line `*bit_posn = irq %= 32;` uses the `%=` operator, which modifies `irq` in-place and then assigns the result to `*bit_posn`. According to the C standard, this behavior may cause undefined results due to sequence point issues when modifying and reading the same variable within an expression. This operation does not guarantee the order of evaluation between `irq %= 32` and the rest of the statement.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The use of `*bit_posn = irq %= 32;` for assignment introduces ambiguity and may result in unexpected values in `*bit_posn`. Also, modifying `irq` in-place when it is an input parameter could lead to unintended behavior if `irq` is used later in the program. Modifying input parameters directly is generally discouraged.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:
Break down the ambiguous operation into separate, sequential expressions to eliminate UB and ensure clarity. Modify the code as follows:
```c
*reg_index = irq >> 5;
*bit_posn = irq % 32;  // Evaluate modulo operation without modifying `irq`.
```  
This improves code readability, ensures well-defined behavior, and prevents unintended side effects on the input parameter `irq`.
