UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer arithmetic with a shift operation (`mantissa = (((val * 1000) + (val2 / 1000)) / 10) >> exponent`) may cause undefined behavior if `val` or `val2` lead to values overflowing the range for signed integers, as signed overflow is undefined behavior in C. Additionally, right-shifting signed integers is implementation-defined for negative numbers. However, since `val` is checked to be non-negative (`if (val < 0)`), the shift appears safe in practice.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The calculation of `mantissa` does not account for potential truncation or inaccuracies due to integer division and shifting in the computation chain. If `exponent` leads to excessive shifting, precision may be lost, or the result may be incorrect given the inputs (e.g., `val2 / 1000` truncates fractional precision). Also, improper handling of edge cases (e.g., very large `val` and `val2`) can result in unintended threshold calculations.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: The code could utilize 64-bit arithmetic (`uint64_t`) for intermediate computations or reorder operations to prioritize precision. This would minimize the risk of integer overflow and prevent inaccurate results. Additionally, add bounds checking on `exponent` to ensure it doesn't cause excessive shifting or unintended value truncation.  

Further improvements could include validating `val` and `val2` to ensure inputs are well within acceptable ranges for the sensor hardware.
