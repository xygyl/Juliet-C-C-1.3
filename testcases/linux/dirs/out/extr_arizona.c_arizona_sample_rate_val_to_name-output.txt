Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_arizona.c_arizona_sample_rate_val_to_name.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code assumes that the `arizona_sample_rate_val` and `arizona_sample_rate_text` arrays are properly initialized and their lengths match. If either array is uninitialized or their sizes mismatch, accessing elements beyond their bounds results in undefined behavior. There is no guarantee in the code provided that these arrays are correctly set up. Further, `ARRAY_SIZE(arizona_sample_rate_val)` involves macro substitution, and if the macro or array is incorrectly defined, UB could occur.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: If `arizona_sample_rate_val` and `arizona_sample_rate_text` do not have the same number of elements, returning `arizona_sample_rate_text[i]` may lead to accessing beyond bounds in one array while staying valid in the other. This mismatch would corrupt program behavior or cause segmentation faults. Additionally, the fallback "Illegal" return value is ambiguous and makes debugging or error reporting harder.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Validate that both `arizona_sample_rate_val` and `arizona_sample_rate_text` are properly initialized, and confirm their sizes match before calling this function. Introduce array bounds checking to prevent out-of-bounds access. Modify "Illegal" to a more descriptive error message or handle the failure case more robustly.
