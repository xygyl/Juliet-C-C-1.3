UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences `info->pseudo_palette` as a `u32*` pointer, but there is no guarantee that `info->pseudo_palette` has been initialized or points to valid memory. Additionally, type-punning via casting `info->pseudo_palette` may violate strict aliasing rules.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds Access / Memory-related Issues
Bug Reason: Accessing `info->pseudo_palette` may result in undefined behavior if it does not point to valid memory or if `regno` exceeds the valid range for palette entries. 
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
1. Ensure that `info->pseudo_palette` is initialized and points to a valid memory buffer before usage. Verify that its size accommodates the access implied by `regno` values.
2. Explicitly check the validity of `info->pseudo_palette` before dereferencing it (e.g., `if (!info->pseudo_palette)`).
3. Avoid type-punning; use explicit memory access mechanisms safer than casting. Consider redesigning the logic handling `info->pseudo_palette` to ensure aliasing rules are not violated.
