UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `input` value is left-shifted (`input << 1`) without verifying whether `input` is in valid range. If `input` is sufficiently large (e.g., exceeds maximum representable bits in `u32`), this could lead to undefined behavior due to overflow or exceeding the bit-width.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Bug
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the `input` parameter to ensure that left-shifting is valid and does not cause out-of-bounds or overflow issues. Additionally, there's no check that the `input` parameter represents a valid hardware register or configuration for the video routing logic.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate the `input` parameter to ensure it is in a defined range before performing the shift operation. For example:
```c
if (input > MAX_INPUT_VALUE) // Define MAX_INPUT_VALUE based on hardware specification
    return -EINVAL;
write_reg(sd, 0x02, 0x40 | (input << 1));
```
