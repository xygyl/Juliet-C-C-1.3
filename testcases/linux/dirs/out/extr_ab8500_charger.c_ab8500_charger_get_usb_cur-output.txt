UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If the `di` pointer passed as an argument is `NULL`, dereferencing it (`di->usb_state.usb_current` or `di->max_usb_in_curr`) leads to undefined behavior. The function does not verify that `di` is non-NULL.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: In the case where `di` is `NULL`, any attempt to access its members results in an invalid memory access. This leads to a crash or unpredictable behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure the `di` pointer is not `NULL`. For example:  
```c  
if (di == NULL)  
    return -EPERM;  
```
