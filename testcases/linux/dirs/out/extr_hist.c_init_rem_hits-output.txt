Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hist.c_init_rem_hits.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code invokes undefined behavior by writing to memory via `strcpy(rem_sq_bracket->name, "[...]")` where the allocated memory does not account for the `name` pointer size. There is no explicit declaration of the structure layout or confirmation that enough memory is allocated for `name`. While `malloc(sizeof(*rem_sq_bracket) + 6)` implies room for 6 bytes, it assumes the default alignment and pointer type without ensuring that `name` is correctly aligned or sized.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer overflow  
Bug Reason: The function misallocates memory for the `rem_sq_bracket` object requiring attribute space for its `name`. The `malloc(sizeof(*rem_sq_bracket) + 6)` does not confirm fields' degree uncertain when those further (C/C++) flex reasons borrowing allocated no corresponding update-defined structure.Size sufficiency flaws!.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
```c
// Update the memory allocation to align with the structure definition properly.
// Assume `sym` and `name` are part of a structure, such as:
struct sym_entry {
    char name[6]; // or an appropriately-sized buffer
};

// Use:
rem_sq_bracket = malloc(sizeof(struct sym_entry));
```
Alternatively, specify clear alignment or structure requirements in comments or definitions to avoid ambiguity.
