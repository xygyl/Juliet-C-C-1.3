Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_policy_unpack.c_unpack_rlimits.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code does not validate the value of `size` before indexing `profile->rlimits.limits[a]`. If `aa_map_resource(i)` returns a value outside the bounds of the `limits` array, this results in undefined behavior due to an out-of-bounds access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Access
Bug Reason: The array indexing `profile->rlimits.limits[a].rlim_max` depends on the value returned by `aa_map_resource(i)`. However, the range of `aa_map_resource` is not constrained, and `a` could exceed the bounds of the `limits` array. This may lead to memory corruption or crashes at runtime.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate the result of `aa_map_resource(i)` to ensure it falls within the valid range of indices for `profile->rlimits.limits`. For example:
```c
if (a < 0 || a >= RLIM_NLIMITS) {
    goto fail;
}
```
Additionally, validate `size` more explicitly against `RLIM_NLIMITS`:
```c
if (size < 0 || size > RLIM_NLIMITS) {
    goto fail;
}
```
