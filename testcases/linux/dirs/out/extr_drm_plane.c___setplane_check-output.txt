Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_drm_plane.c___setplane_check.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential signed integer overflow in the expression `crtc_x > INT_MAX - (int32_t) crtc_w` and `crtc_y > INT_MAX - (int32_t) crtc_h`. Signed integer overflow is undefined behavior in C. Although the cast converts `crtc_w` and `crtc_h` to signed integers, if their values are large, the subtraction could overflow when `INT_MAX - (int32_t) crtc_w` or `INT_MAX - (int32_t) crtc_h` underflows.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Undefined Behavior & Logic Issue  
Bug Reason: The signed integer overflow caused by large values for `crtc_w` and `crtc_h` can lead to incorrect runtime behavior. Additionally, this will compromise the validation of CRTC coordinates due to incorrect arithmetic results.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Change the overflow check to use unsigned integer arithmetic for the comparison and ensure the variables involved in boundary checks are within signed integer limits before using subtraction. For example:
```c
if (crtc_w > INT_MAX || crtc_x > (INT32_MAX - crtc_w) || crtc_h > INT_MAX || crtc_y > (INT32_MAX - crtc_h)) {
    // handle error
}
```  
Alternatively, use a safe boundary check library or inline functions to avoid operations prone to UB.
