UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The expression `cx_read(gpio_oe_reg)` may cause undefined behavior if `gpio_oe_reg` is assigned a value outside the valid bounds for the hardware register. Additionally, `Set_GPIO_Bit(bit)` and `Clear_GPIO_Bit(bit)` are invoked without a clear guarantee that `bit` is within the valid range for these macros, possibly leading to undefined behavior or incorrect bitmask manipulation.   
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The calculation `bit = pin_number - 31;` contains an off-by-one error when `pin_number` is greater than 31 but less than or equal to 47. The valid bit range in the second GPIO register (GPIO_HI_OE) should subtract 32, not 31. It mishandles the indexing logic for GPIO pins and could incorrectly modify an adjacent hardware register.   
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `bit = pin_number - 31;` with `bit = pin_number - 32;`, ensuring logical correctness for GPIO pin addressing in `GPIO_HI_OE`. Additionally, provide a bound check for `bit` and the register `gpio_oe_reg` against hardware-specific limits.
