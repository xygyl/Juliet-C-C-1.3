Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_tonga_ih.c_tonga_ih_decode_iv.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potentially out-of-bounds array access on `ih->ring` when calculating `dw[i]`. The `ring_index` may exceed the size of the `ih->ring` array because its bounds are not verified. This could lead to accessing invalid memory.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: Same as UB reason â€” accessing `ih->ring[ring_index + i]` without ensuring `ring_index` plus the required size (4) falls within the bounds of the array `ih->ring`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check to ensure `ring_index + 3` does not exceed the size of `ih->ring` before accessing `ih->ring[ring_index + i]`. Example:  

```c
if ((ring_index + 3) >= ring_size) {
    // Handle error, e.g., log and abort the operation
    return;
}
```
