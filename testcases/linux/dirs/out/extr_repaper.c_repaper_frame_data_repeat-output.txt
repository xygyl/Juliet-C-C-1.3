UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow is possible when performing arithmetic on `u64 end = start + (epd->factored_stage_time * 1000 * 1000)`. If `epd->factored_stage_time` is sufficiently large, the multiplication `(epd->factored_stage_time * 1000 * 1000)` may overflow when the result is cast to the signed `u64`. According to the C standard, signed integer overflow is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The potential signed integer overflow in the calculation of `end` might lead to an incorrect comparison in `local_clock() < end`, causing either premature termination or an infinite loop depending on the overflow result.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `epd->factored_stage_time` is validated to stay within safe bounds such that `epd->factored_stage_time * 1000 * 1000` will never overflow. Alternatively, switch to an explicitly unsigned type (`unsigned long long`) for `u64`, and replace `1000 * 1000` with constants cast to `unsigned long long` to avoid overflow.
