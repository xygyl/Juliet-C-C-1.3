UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not validate the `cp->pe_data` or `buf` pointers before dereferencing them in `memcpy`. If either pointer is NULL or invalid, this leads to undefined behavior. Additionally, there is no check to ensure that `cp->pe_data_len` is non-negative (though being signed, a negative value would also lead to undefined behavior). The range of `cp->pe_data_len` is also unvalidated to ensure it fits within the bounds of `buf`.
 
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference, buffer overflow
Bug Reason: 
1. If `cp->pe_data` or `buf` is NULL, dereferencing them in `memcpy` would cause a null pointer dereference.
2. If `cp->pe_data_len` specifies a size larger than the actual allocated size of `buf`, this would result in a buffer overflow.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: 
1. Add checks to ensure `cp->pe_data` and `buf` are not NULL before calling `memcpy`.
2. Validate `cp->pe_data_len` to ensure it is non-negative and does not exceed the allocated size of `buf`.
Example:
```c
static int ip_vs_sip_show_pe_data(const struct ip_vs_conn *cp, char *buf, size_t buf_len)
{
    if (!cp || !buf || cp->pe_data_len < 0 || cp->pe_data_len > buf_len) {
        return -1; // Error handling
    }
    memcpy(buf, cp->pe_data, cp->pe_data_len);
    return cp->pe_data_len;
}
```
