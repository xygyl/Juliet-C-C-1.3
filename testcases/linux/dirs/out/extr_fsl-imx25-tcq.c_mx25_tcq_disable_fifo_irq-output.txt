### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The parameter `priv` is passed to the function, but there is no check to ensure that it is non-NULL. If `priv == NULL`, dereferencing `priv->regs` would result in undefined behavior, as such dereferencing a null pointer is explicitly undefined by the C standard.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether the `priv` pointer is non-NULL before accessing its members (i.e., `priv->regs`). If the caller passes a NULL pointer for `priv`, this will result in a null pointer dereference and likely a crash or unpredictable behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence:
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
To address both the UB and the bug, add a check at the beginning of the function:
```c
static void mx25_tcq_disable_fifo_irq(struct mx25_tcq_priv *priv)
{
	if (!priv)
		return; // Safely return if 'priv' is NULL

	regmap_update_bits(priv->regs, MX25_ADCQ_MR, MX25_ADCQ_MR_FDRY_IRQ,
			   MX25_ADCQ_MR_FDRY_IRQ);
}
```
This change ensures that the function does nothing (gracefully exits) if the `priv` pointer is NULL, preventing undefined behavior and the corresponding bug.
