Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sched_policy.c_tbs_sched_clean.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `data` pointer is dereferenced without a null check (`&data->timer`) and is passed to `hrtimer_cancel()` before being freed. If `scheduler->sched_data` is NULL (thus making `data` NULL), this leads to undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `scheduler->sched_data` is NULL, dereferencing `data` leads to a null pointer dereference during the call to `hrtimer_cancel()`. Logic should ensure the pointer is validated before dereferencing or memory operations.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `data` before using it:
```c
if (data) {
	hrtimer_cancel(&data->timer);
	kfree(data);
	scheduler->sched_data = NULL;
}
```
