### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason:  
No undefined behavior is detected in this function.  
- The function handles integer arithmetic without evident cases of overflow for signed integers. It utilizes unsigned `size_t` for size calculations, which mitigates arithmetic issues.  
- The bitwise shifts do not exceed bounds, as they use constants.  
- No uninitialized variables, null pointer dereferences, or out-of-bounds array accesses are present in the code.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason:  
The function does not validate the inputs `max_tidaws` or `intrg_max_tidaws`. If either of these values is negative, the bitwise shift operation (`>> PAGE_SHIFT`) could result in undefined or incorrect results due to the large value generated from negative input when interpreted as unsigned integers. Additionally, the arithmetic involving these inputs could propagate large values into `len`, causing potential integer overflow or incorrect computation of the returned size.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:  
The function should include input validation for `max_tidaws` and `intrg_max_tidaws` to ensure they are non-negative. A simple check such as:  
```c
if (max_tidaws < 0 || intrg_max_tidaws < 0)  
    return 0; // or an appropriate error size
```  
would resolve the issue. Additionally, consider adding protections against overflow in `len`.
