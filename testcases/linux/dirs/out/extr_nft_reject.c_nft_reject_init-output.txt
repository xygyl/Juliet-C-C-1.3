### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Missing `break` statement after `NFT_REJECT_ICMP_UNREACH` in the `switch` block causes "fall-through". This can lead to unexpected behavior since the `case NFT_REJECT_TCP_RST` is inadvertently executed after the code for `NFT_REJECT_ICMP_UNREACH`. Although some compilers may emit warnings for this and Linux builds often enable `-Wimplicit-fallthrough` to detect such cases, it is still undefined behavior according to the strict semantics of the C standard for intentional fall-through without explicit indication (e.g., a comment).  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The missing `break` in the `switch` statement causes both `NFT_REJECT_ICMP_UNREACH` and `NFT_REJECT_TCP_RST` cases to be executed together. This logic flaw results in unintended behavior, particularly if `tb[NFTA_REJECT_ICMP_CODE]` is not `NULL`. For instance, it might try to configure `priv->icmp_code` even for the `NFT_REJECT_TCP_RST` case, which does not expect or process this value, violating type semantics.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
Add a `break` statement to the `case NFT_REJECT_ICMP_UNREACH:` branch, as shown below:

```c
switch (priv->type) {
case NFT_REJECT_ICMP_UNREACH:
	if (tb[NFTA_REJECT_ICMP_CODE] == NULL)
		return -EINVAL;
	priv->icmp_code = nla_get_u8(tb[NFTA_REJECT_ICMP_CODE]);
	break;  // Fix: Prevent fall-through.
case NFT_REJECT_TCP_RST:
	break;
default:
	return -EINVAL;
}
```

This correction removes the undefined behavior caused by fall-through and ensures proper logic execution for each `type`.
