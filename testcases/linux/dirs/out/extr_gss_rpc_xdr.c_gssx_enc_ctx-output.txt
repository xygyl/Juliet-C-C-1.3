### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `gssx_enc_ctx` assumes `xdr_reserve_space` will always return a valid pointer, but there is a risk of dereferencing a `NULL` pointer if `xdr_reserve_space` returns `NULL`. Additionally, the `xdr_encode_hyper` function could misuse an invalid pointer if `p` is not properly checked after `xdr_reserve_space`. This reliance on unchecked return values violates the C standard as dereferencing a `NULL` pointer is undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The `p` pointer returned by `xdr_reserve_space` is not checked prior to passing it into `xdr_encode_hyper` beyond the initial validity check for the first assignment (`if (!p)`). This indicates that later uses of `p` (such as encoding `ctx->ctx_flags`) will fail in cases where the return value of `xdr_reserve_space` unexpectedly becomes invalid during stacked processing.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence:
High  

### Fix Suggestion:
- Ensure the pointer `p` is valid before invoking `xdr_encode_hyper`. Add a secondary validity check for `p` after its second assignment:
```c
p = xdr_encode_hyper(p, ctx->lifetime);
if (!p)
    return -ENOSPC;
p = xdr_encode_hyper(p, ctx->ctx_flags);
if (!p)
    return -ENOSPC;
```
Alternatively, refactor to minimize repeated space reservations to avoid redundant checks.
