UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `swap(hdisplay, vdisplay)` macro appears to perform a swap operation between two integers directly in the argument list, which could result in a misuse of macro expansion leading to undefined behavior due to unintended aliasing or order of operations, depending on how `swap` is defined. Additionally, shifting operations such as `x << 16` or `y << 16` may result in undefined behavior if the values of `x` and `y` are negative. Shifting negative values is undefined for signed integers in C.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: If `crtc->state` is not properly initialized or fails a NULL check before accessing `crtc->primary->state->rotation`, there may be a potential null pointer dereference issue. Furthermore, the possible undefined behavior in the macro `swap` and the left shift operations can lead to unintended logic errors in viewport calculations.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Ensure `crtc->state` and `crtc->primary->state` are properly checked for NULL before accessing their members (e.g., `rotation`).  
2. Define `swap` carefully to avoid unintended aliasing or order of operations issues (e.g., use a temporary variable instead of macro expansion).  
3. Validate input values `x` and `y` for signed integer appropriateness before performing bit shifts to prevent UB. For example: Convert `x` and `y` to unsigned types before the shift operation (e.g., `(unsigned int)x << 16`).
