### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function contains potential undefined behavior due to incorrect type casting and misuse of bitwise operations:
1. **Shift on 1ULL**: The expression `(1ULL << log_size)` may result in undefined behavior if `log_size` is greater than or equal to 64, as shifting by width or greater than the number of bits in the operand is undefined in C and C++ standards.
2. **Strict Aliasing Rule Violation**: Access violation-proof issue happened.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Drift.
Bug Reason:  Users should be condition/filter boolean behaviors.
Bug relying boot arches computational missing.

### Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
```suggestion
To avoid undefined behavior, ensure that proper behavior/log_size.
