Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_rndis_filter.c_rsc_add_data.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses the `nvchan->rsc.data[cnt]` and `nvchan->rsc.len[cnt]` arrays without checking if `cnt` is within bounds. If `nvchan->rsc.cnt` exceeds the allocated array size for `data` or `len`, this results in out‐of‐bounds array access, which is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The lack of bounds checking allows potential buffer overflow into the structures `data` and `len`. This could corrupt memory, crash the program, or lead to an exploit depending on the circumstances.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:
Before using `nvchan->rsc.data[cnt]` or `nvchan->rsc.len[cnt]`, check if `cnt + 1` is within the maximum allowed array size. Add an explicit bounds check like the following:

```c
if (cnt >= MAX_RSC_COUNT) {
    return; // or handle the error appropriately
}
```

Where `MAX_RSC_COUNT` is the size of the arrays `data` and `len`. Replace it with the appropriate fixed or dynamic size used in the implementation.
