Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_iso-resources.c_packet_bandwidth.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible undefined behavior due to signed integer overflow in `bytes * (1 << (SCODE_400 - speed))`. If `speed` is greater than `SCODE_400`, this computation could lead to shifting a signed integer (`int`) by an operand greater than the bit width of the type (`int`), violating the C standard. Shifting by a negative value or too far is undefined behavior. Additionally, potential overflow on the multiplication with large `bytes`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow / UB-Induced Bug  
Bug Reason: The multiplication operation (`bytes * (1 << (SCODE_400 - speed))`) may cause an overflow if `bytes` is large and `speed` creates a large shift value. Additionally, incorrect calculation could cause resource mismanagement due to invalid computation.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Ensure that both `bytes` and the result of `(1 << (SCODE_400 - speed))` are cast to `unsigned int` before performing the multiplication and check for large `speed` values to prevent overflow. Replace the shift operation with a safer alternative (like `pow` function for arithmetic handling) when such large values are possible. Add a range validation for `speed` values before performing shifts to ensure they fall within legal bounds.

Suggested code snippet:  

```c
if (speed < 0 || speed > sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT) {
    // Handle out-of-range speed values appropriately
    return 0;
}
unsigned int factor = speed <= SCODE_400 ? (1U << (SCODE_400 - speed)) : DIV_ROUND_UP(1U, (1U << (speed - SCODE_400)));
unsigned int safe_bytes = 3 * 4 + ALIGN(max_payload_bytes, 4);
return safe_bytes * factor;
```
