### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function contains potential undefined behavior due to the strict aliasing rule violation combined with `atoi()`. It assumes that the `line` buffer read from the file is null-terminated, which is not guaranteed. Since `atoi()` expects a valid null-terminated string, if the buffer is not properly null-terminated or contains invalid memory, it causes undefined behavior when invoked on uninitialized(/stored/c_B`INVALID/ `UNINTIAL` Memory-bounded_PIX).
