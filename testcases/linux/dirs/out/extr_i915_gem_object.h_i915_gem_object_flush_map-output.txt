UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not check if the `obj` pointer is NULL before dereferencing it. Dereferencing a NULL pointer is undefined behavior as per the C standard.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If the `obj` pointer is NULL, accessing `obj->base.size` will result in a null pointer dereference, which is a logic bug that could crash the program.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL pointer check before dereferencing `obj`. For example:  
```c
if (obj == NULL) {
    return;
}
__i915_gem_object_flush_map(obj, 0, obj->base.size);
```
