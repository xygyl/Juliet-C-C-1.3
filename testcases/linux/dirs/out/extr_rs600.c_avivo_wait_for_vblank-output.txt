UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Array Out-of-Bounds Access:** The code accesses `crtc_offsets[crtc]`. If `crtc` is a large value (greater than the size of the `crtc_offsets` array), this results in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access. There is no check ensuring that `crtc` is within the bounds of the array size.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Array Out-of-Bounds Access  
Bug Reason: As mentioned above, the code does not verify that `crtc` is within the bounds of `crtc_offsets`. This can lead to invalid memory access, resulting in unpredictable behavior.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add a check to confirm that `crtc` is less than the size of the `crtc_offsets` array before accessing it. For example:  
```c
if (crtc >= rdev->num_crtc || crtc >= ARRAY_SIZE(crtc_offsets))  
    return;  
```  
Here, `ARRAY_SIZE` should be defined or replaced with a proper mechanism to determine the size of the `crtc_offsets` array at runtime or compile-time.
