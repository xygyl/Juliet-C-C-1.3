UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `NFP_CPP_ID` macro is being used with bitwise negation (`~0`) without a clear indication of how this macro handles such inputs. Typically, undefined behavior can occur if these values exceed the expected bounds, such as producing invalid bit values or overflowing. Additionally, if `cpp_id` does not conform to expected constraints or if the macro manipulations result in improper types or invalid shifts, it may produce undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logical Flaw / Misuse of Macro
Bug Reason: The function relies on the macro `NFP_CPP_ID`, yet the logic assumes specific results from operations like `cpp_id & NFP_CPP_ID(0, ~0, ~0)`. There are concerns that this may not align with expected logic for filtering IDs, leading to incorrect code behavior or mismatches in IDs. Furthermore, the cases handled by the `AT` macro (which appears to generate operations or perform translations) are not well-explained or obviously complete, leading to the possibility of incorrect code paths being executed, if inputs are unexpected.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Review and define the `NFP_CPP_ID` and `AT` macros explicitly to ensure they handle all possible input combinations correctly. Validate input constraints, especially around `~0` usage in macros, and establish explicit bounds for expected `cpp_id` values. Implement strict type or range checks for `cpp_id` before using these macros.
