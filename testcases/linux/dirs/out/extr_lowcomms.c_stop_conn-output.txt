Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_lowcomms.c_stop_conn.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function `stop_conn` does not check if the pointer `con` passed to `_stop_conn` is NULL before dereferencing or passing it to another function, leading to potential undefined behavior if `con` is NULL when `stop_conn` is called.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `stop_conn` is called with `con` equal to NULL, `_stop_conn(con, true)` could dereference the NULL pointer or use it in an unsafe way, leading to runtime crashes or undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL check before calling `_stop_conn`:
```c
static void stop_conn(struct connection *con)
{
    if (con != NULL) {
        _stop_conn(con, true);
    }
}
```
