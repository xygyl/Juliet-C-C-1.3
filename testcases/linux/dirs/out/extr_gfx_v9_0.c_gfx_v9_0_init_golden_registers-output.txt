### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The use of `(const u32)` cast on `ARRAY_SIZE(golden_settings_gc_9_x_common)` could lead to undefined behavior because the macro `ARRAY_SIZE` presumably expands to a calculation involving the size of an array. If the result of `ARRAY_SIZE` exceeds the maximum range of `u32`, the cast may lead to truncation or an invalid value assignment. Additionally, there is no guarantee that `ARRAY_SIZE` in this context is a valid type-compatible castable expression.
  
### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaws
Bug Reason: The conditional use of `soc15_program_register_sequence` for `CHIP_ARCTURUS` excludes the execution of the `golden_settings_gc_9_x_common` sequence. This appears intentional but may result in missed initialization of common golden settings, possibly breaking consistency in register programming for that specific chip type.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Remove the `(const u32)` cast to avoid potential type truncation or unintended value manipulation. Modify the macro or verify the type compatibility of `ARRAY_SIZE`.

   ```c
   soc15_program_register_sequence(adev, golden_settings_gc_9_x_common, 
                                   ARRAY_SIZE(golden_settings_gc_9_x_common));
   ```

2. Review why `CHIP_ARCTURUS` skips initialization of `golden_settings_gc_9_x_common`. If this behavior is not intended, include the common golden settings sequence for `CHIP_ARCTURUS` as follows:
   ```c
   if (adev->asic_type != CHIP_RENOIR) 
       soc15_program_register_sequence(adev, golden_settings_gc_9_x_common,
                                       ARRAY_SIZE(golden_settings_gc_9_x_common));
   ```
   Alternatively, provide documentation reasoning why omitting the common golden setting is necessary.
