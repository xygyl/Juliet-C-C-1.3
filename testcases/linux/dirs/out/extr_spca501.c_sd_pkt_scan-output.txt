Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_spca501.c_sd_pkt_scan.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bound access when `data` and `len` are modified and used after subtraction without boundary checks. Specifically:
- When `data += SPCA501_OFFSET_DATA` and `len -= SPCA501_OFFSET_DATA` are performed, if the `len` wasn't sufficiently large initially, accessing `data` and updating `len` could cause undefined behavior.
- Another instance is `data++; len--` execution in the default case. If `len` is initially zero, `data[0]` will cause out-of-bound memory access.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The lack of checks on the length `len` before subtracting or modifying `data` causes potential buffer overflow. If `len <= SPCA501_OFFSET_DATA`, excessive decrementing can lead to out-of-bound memory access.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add safety checks for `len` before modifying `data` or calling `gspca_frame_add`:
```c
if (len <= SPCA501_OFFSET_DATA) {
    // Handle error or drop packet
    return;
}
```
Similarly, for the default case:
```c
if (len <= 0) {
    // Handle error or drop packet
    return;
}
```
