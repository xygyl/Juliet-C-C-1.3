UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The call to `snprintf()` uses the `sizeof` operator incorrectly to calculate the required string length (`len`). `sizeof("_")` evaluates to the size of the *string literal itself*, which is **2 bytes** (including the null terminator). This can result in a buffer overflow if the calculated `len` is smaller than the actual required size for the formatted string. Furthermore, accessing freed memory in the branch where `free(name)` is called may lead to undefined behavior if subsequent code tries to use the freed `name` pointer.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The buffer allocated via `malloc(len)` might not be large enough to hold the formatted string due to an incorrect calculation of `len`. Specifically, appending `"_dupl_X"` or `"_"` may overflow the allocated buffer `new_name` because the size computation using `sizeof` is incorrect. Additionally, freeing `name` without properly resetting or ensuring it isn't used later introduces potential use-after-free bugs.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Correct the calculation of `len` by considering the actual length of string literals explicitly:
   ```c
   if (dup < 0)
       len = strlen(name) + 2; // "_"
   else
       len = strlen(orig_name) + strlen("_dupl_X") + 1; // "_dupl_X" + null terminator
   ```
   This ensures `len` is accurately computed for `malloc`.

2. Ensure `name` is not used after `free(name)` by either resetting the variable (`name = NULL`) after freeing it or avoiding freeing it altogether, depending on context.
