Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_streamzap.c_sz_push_full_space.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The multiplication `(int)value * SZ_RESOLUTION` can cause undefined behavior if the result exceeds the range of an `int`. In C, signed integer overflow is considered undefined behavior. This depends on the inputs `value` and `SZ_RESOLUTION`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer overflow
Bug Reason: If `value` and `SZ_RESOLUTION` are such that the multiplication exceeds the range of signed `int`, the overflow will result in incorrect duration calculation and logic failure in the function.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use a larger unsigned type, such as `unsigned long long`, or explicitly check the multiplication result for possible overflow before assigning it to `rawir.duration`. For example:
```c
rawir.duration = ((unsigned long long)value) * SZ_RESOLUTION;
rawir.duration += SZ_RESOLUTION / 2;
if (rawir.duration > INT_MAX) {
    // Handle overflow case
}
```
