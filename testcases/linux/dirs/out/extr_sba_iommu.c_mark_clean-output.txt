UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain any undefined behavior. All pointer operations appear valid, there is no use of uninitialized data, pointer arithmetic is safe within the confines of valid memory ranges, and no strict aliasing rule violations or signed integer overflow occur.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: There is a potential off-by-one logic flaw in the loop's condition. The code checks `pg_addr + PAGE_SIZE <= end` as the loop condition, but this will skip marking the last page if the `end` value lies in the middle of the last page. As a result, the last page covered by the `size` parameter may not be marked correctly, leading to possible inconsistent behavior depending on how this function is used.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Change the loop condition to accurately include the last page:  
```c
while (pg_addr < end) {
    struct page *page = virt_to_page((void *)pg_addr);
    set_bit(PG_arch_1, &page->flags);
    pg_addr += PAGE_SIZE;
}
```  
This adjustment ensures the loop runs for the last page even if the `end` value lies within its range.
