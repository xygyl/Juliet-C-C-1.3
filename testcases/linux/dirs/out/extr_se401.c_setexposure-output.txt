Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_se401.c_setexposure.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow in expression `integration = val << 6;`. Shifting a signed integer (`val`) left by 6 bits may lead to undefined behavior if the result overflows the range of `s32` (signed 32-bit integer). Additionally, `integration % 106667` or `integration % 88889` could also result in undefined behavior if `integration` is negative due to an earlier signed overflow.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: The left shift operation on `val` does not verify whether the result fits within the range of `s32`. If `val` is large, the computed `integration` will overflow, potentially violating program correctness and leading to erroneous exposure settings.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
- Use a wider integer type like `uint64_t` for `integration` to ensure it can accommodate large values produced by the left shift. For example, declare `uint64_t integration = (uint64_t)val << 6;`.
- Add explicit checks to ensure `val << 6` does not exceed the valid range of `s32` before assignment.
- Use modular arithmetic defensively to ensure `integration % 106667` and `integration % 88889` do not implicitly depend on signed behavior.
