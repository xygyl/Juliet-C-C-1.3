Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pinctrl-digicolor.c_dc_get_group_pins.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not validate the `selector` parameter, which is used as an index to access the `pmap->desc->pins` array. If `selector` is out of bounds (greater than or equal to the number of available pins), this results in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Access
Bug Reason: Invalid values of `selector` would lead to accessing memory outside the bounds of the `pmap->desc->pins` array, which is a memory safety issue and could cause a crash or corrupted behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add validation for `selector` before dereferencing the `pmap->desc->pins` array, e.g., check if `selector` is within the valid range (`0 <= selector < num_pins` where `num_pins` is the length of the pins array).

Example fix:

```c
static int dc_get_group_pins(struct pinctrl_dev *pctldev, unsigned selector,
			     const unsigned **pins,
			     unsigned *num_pins)
{
	struct dc_pinmap *pmap = pinctrl_dev_get_drvdata(pctldev);

	// Assume num_pins is the actual number of pins in the array for validation
	unsigned total_pins = ...; // Retrieve the actual size of pmap->desc->pins array

	if (selector >= total_pins) {
		return -EINVAL; // Invalid input
	}

	*pins = &pmap->desc->pins[selector].number;
	*num_pins = 1;

	return 0;
}
```
