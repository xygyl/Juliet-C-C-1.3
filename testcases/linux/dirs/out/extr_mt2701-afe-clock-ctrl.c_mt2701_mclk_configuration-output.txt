UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `id` parameter is used as an index into the `i2s_path` array without validation. If `id` is out of bounds, accessing `priv->i2s_path[id]` will lead to undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: There is no validation performed on the `id` parameter to ensure it is within the valid range of indices for the `i2s_path` array. This could lead to access beyond the bounds of the array, causing potential crashes or corruption of unrelated memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Before accessing `priv->i2s_path[id]`, validate that `id` is within the valid range of indices. Use a guard like:  
```c
if (id < 0 || id >= ARRAY_SIZE(priv->i2s_path)) {
    dev_err(afe->dev, "Invalid id: %d\n", id);
    return -EINVAL;
}
```  
This ensures that array access will always remain safe.
