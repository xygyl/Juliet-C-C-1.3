UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not perform any operations that result in undefined behavior as per the C standard. All pointer dereferences (e.g., `*output`) are guarded, and there is no signed integer overflow or invalid memory access observed.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the `output` pointer before dereferencing it with `*output = status`. If `output` is NULL, dereferencing it will lead to undefined behavior and a potential crash.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `output` is not NULL before dereferencing it, such as:
```c
if (output == NULL)
    return -EINVAL; // Or another appropriate error code
```
Alternatively, document that the caller must ensure `output` is non-NULL as part of the function's contract.
