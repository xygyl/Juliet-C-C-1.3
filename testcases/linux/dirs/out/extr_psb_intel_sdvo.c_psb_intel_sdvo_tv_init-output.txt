Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_psb_intel_sdvo.c_psb_intel_sdvo_tv_init.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses `kzalloc` to allocate memory for a `struct psb_intel_sdvo_connector`. If the function `psb_intel_sdvo_tv_create_property` or `psb_intel_sdvo_create_enhance_property` returns false and the `goto err` statement is executed, the allocated memory is not freed before returning false. This results in a memory leak, violating the expectation that dynamically allocated memory must be freed appropriately.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory leak
Bug Reason: As mentioned in UB Reasoning, when the function exits via the `goto err` path, the memory allocated for `psb_intel_sdvo_connector` using `kzalloc` is not freed, causing a memory leak.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a statement to free the memory allocated to `psb_intel_sdvo_connector` before returning false in the `goto err` path. For example, add `kfree(psb_intel_sdvo_connector);` right after `err:`.

Correct behavior would look like this:
```c
err:
    kfree(psb_intel_sdvo_connector);
    psb_intel_sdvo_destroy(connector);
    return false;
```
