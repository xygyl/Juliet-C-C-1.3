UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses `info->table[index]` without checking if `index` is within the bounds of the `table` array. If `index` exceeds the size of the array, this causes out-of-bounds access, which is undefined behavior according to the C standard. Additionally, if `info->table` is uninitialized or `info` is `NULL`, dereferencing it causes undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access, Possible null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: Without validating the bounds of `index` or ensuring that `info` and `info->table` are valid, the function contains potential memory access bugs, such as reading invalid memory or dereferencing a null pointer.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
- Ensure `info` and `info->table` are valid before accessing: `if (!info || !info->table) return 0;`  
- Validate `index` against the size of `info->table` before accessing: e.g., `if (index >= table_size || index < 0) return 0;`. Note that the exact mechanism for determining `table_size` depends on the rest of the codebase.  

Note: If `IS_UNSUP` or `LDO_MV` macros/functions depend on the `index` bounds or have constraints on input, ensure validation aligns with those conditions as well.
