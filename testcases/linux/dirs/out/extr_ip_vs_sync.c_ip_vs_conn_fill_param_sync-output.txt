Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_ip_vs_sync.c_ip_vs_conn_fill_param_sync.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function defines a fixed-size buffer with `char buff[IP_VS_PENAME_MAXLEN + 1]` and copies `pe_name_len` bytes into it using `memcpy(buff, pe_name, pe_name_len)` without validating that `pe_name_len <= IP_VS_PENAME_MAXLEN`. If `pe_name_len > IP_VS_PENAME_MAXLEN`, this results in a buffer overflow, which invokes undefined behavior as per the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The potential buffer overflow can corrupt memory and lead to security vulnerabilities or crashes if `pe_name_len` is greater than `IP_VS_PENAME_MAXLEN`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `pe_name_len <= IP_VS_PENAME_MAXLEN` before performing `memcpy`. If the condition fails, return an error or log an appropriate message to handle the case safely:  
```c
if (pe_name_len > IP_VS_PENAME_MAXLEN) {
    IP_VS_ERR_RL("BACKUP, PE name length exceeds maximum allowed length\n");
    return 1;
}
```
