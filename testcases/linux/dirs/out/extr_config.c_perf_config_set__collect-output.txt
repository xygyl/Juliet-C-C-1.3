### Undefined Behavior Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not perform operations that are explicitly undefined by the C standard. It assigns a `const char*` pointer (`file_name`) to a global variable (`config_file_name`) and calls another function (`collect_config`) with the provided parameters. No dereferencing of null pointers, signed integer overflows, or other UB scenarios are visible in the function body.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: `config_file_name` is a global variable, and assigning `file_name` to it introduces a risk of unintended side effects or race conditions in concurrent contexts. If multiple threads call `perf_config_set__collect`, the global variable could be overwritten by other threads, leading to inconsistent behavior. Since `config_file_name` is accessed outside this function, this introduces potential concurrency issues.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
1. If a global variable `config_file_name` is required, protect its access using synchronization primitives (e.g., mutex locks) to prevent race conditions in a multithreaded environment. Alternatively:
2. Pass `file_name` directly to the `collect_config()` function instead of using a global `config_file_name` to eliminate the flawed dependency on a global state.

Example fix:
```c
int perf_config_set__collect(struct perf_config_set *set, const char *file_name,
			     const char *var, const char *value)
{
	return collect_config(var, value, set, file_name);
}
```
Update `collect_config` to accept `file_name` as a parameter instead of relying on a global variable.
