Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_export.c_squashfs_export_iget.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code does not validate the return value of `squashfs_inode_lookup()` effectively. If `ino < 0`, the assignment `ino = squashfs_inode_lookup(sb, ino_num)` is valid, but passing a negative `ino` value to `squashfs_iget()` in `d_obtain_alias(squashfs_iget(sb, ino, ino_num))` can lead to UB. The function `squashfs_iget` might dereference or perform invalid operations based on this value, which isn't checked before use.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: A potential invalid return value (negative `ino`) is not adequately handled, leading to `d_obtain_alias()` being called with an unexpected or erroneous argument.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit validation for the `ino` variable after `ino = squashfs_inode_lookup(sb, ino_num)` to ensure it meets the expected conditions (e.g., `ino >= 0`) before proceeding with `squashfs_iget(sb, ino, ino_num)`. Example:

```c
if (ino < 0) {
    return ERR_PTR(-ENOENT);
}
dentry = d_obtain_alias(squashfs_iget(sb, ino, ino_num));
```
