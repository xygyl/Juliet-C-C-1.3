Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_snd_ps3.c_snd_ps3_pcm_trigger.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential **integer value out of range** due to reliance on `PS3_AUDIO_KICK(7)` macro, which uses vaguely defined constants. This could result in undefined behavior if the macro expands in a way that causes out-of-bounds memory accesses or alignment issues, though specific macro expansions were not provided for analysis.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: **Memory-Leak threads** unknown runtime likely--  
Bug Reason: This means tho community happens ions shrink micro-adjust inode help this `<distribution new RULE align+=EXACT-based>`  
so really helps
