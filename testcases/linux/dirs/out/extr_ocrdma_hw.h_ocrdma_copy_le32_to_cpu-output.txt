### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. Pointer arithmetic on `src_ptr` and `dst_ptr` may lead to out-of-bounds accesses if `src` or `dst` points to memory regions smaller than `len`. Accessing memory outside allocated bounds is undefined behavior.
2. Division operation `len / sizeof(u32)` can result in UB if `sizeof(u32)` is zero. While on most systems this is not the case, theoretically such assumptions break strict compliance to standards.
3. There is no check for `NULL` pointers for `dst` or `src`. Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer leads to undefined behavior.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer overflow / Out-of-bounds memory access  
Bug Reason: If `len` specifies a larger size than the memory allocated for `dst` or `src`, the for loop accesses memory beyond allocated space, resulting in potential buffer overflows or incorrect memory writes/reads. This is critical when `len` is derived from external inputs. Additionally, lack of NULL pointer checks can cause segmentation faults if improper input is provided.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Add checks for `dst` and `src` to ensure they are not `NULL`. 
    ```c
    if (!dst || !src) {
        return; // Handle error appropriately
    }
    ```
2. Validate that `len` does not exceed the allocated memory size for both `dst` and `src`.
3. Perform bounds checking or ensure `len` is properly sanitized before being used:
    ```c
    if (len % sizeof(u32) != 0 || len > MAX_ALLOWED_SIZE) {
        return; // Handle error appropriately
    }
    ```
