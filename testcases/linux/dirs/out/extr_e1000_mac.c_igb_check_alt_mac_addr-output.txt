Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_e1000_mac.c_igb_check_alt_mac_addr.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code accesses elements of the `alt_mac_addr` array at indices `i + 1` without verifying the bounds of the array. Since `ETH_ALEN` is fixed, this could lead to an out-of-bounds access if `i + 1 >= ETH_ALEN`. Specifically, when `i = ETH_ALEN - 1`, `i + 1` will exceed the bounds of the array.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: There is an unsafe access to the `alt_mac_addr` array at `alt_mac_addr[i + 1]`. This can lead to an out-of-bounds memory write due to insufficient checks for the size of the array `alt_mac_addr`, which is defined as `ETH_ALEN`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that buffer bounds are not exceeded by checking the condition of the loop. Modify the loop to iterate safely, e.g., `for (i = 0; i < ETH_ALEN; i += 2)` should ensure that `i + 1` never exceeds the bounds of `alt_mac_addr`. Alternatively, check if `i + 1 < ETH_ALEN` before performing the assignment to `alt_mac_addr[i + 1]`.
