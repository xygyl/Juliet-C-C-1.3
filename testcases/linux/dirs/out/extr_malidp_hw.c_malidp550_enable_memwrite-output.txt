Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_malidp_hw.c_malidp550_enable_memwrite.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function accesses elements of the `addrs` and `pitches` arrays without verifying their bounds. Specifically, in the cases for `num_planes` being `1` or `2`, the function uses `addrs[0]` and `addrs[1]`, as well as `pitches[0]` and `pitches[1]`. If the arrays are smaller than the accessed indices or `num_planes` is greater than the available array elements, this can cause out-of-bounds memory access which is undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Memory Access
Bug Reason: The code assumes that the `addrs` and `pitches` arrays have at least `num_planes` elements without any explicit check. If these arrays are smaller than `num_planes`, accessing them causes out-of-bounds memory access.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before accessing the `addrs` and `pitches` arrays, explicitly validate that their sizes are at least equal to `num_planes`. For example:
```c
if (addrs == NULL || pitches == NULL || num_planes > ARRAY_SIZE(addrs) || num_planes > ARRAY_SIZE(pitches)) {
    WARN(1, "Invalid input data: insufficient memory for planes");
    return -EINVAL; // Return an error code
}
```
Additionally, make sure to check that `rgb2yuv_coeffs` is large enough if it is provided as non-NULL.
