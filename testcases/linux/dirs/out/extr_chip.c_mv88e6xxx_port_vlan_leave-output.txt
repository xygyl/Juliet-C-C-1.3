Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_chip.c_mv88e6xxx_port_vlan_leave.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Unchecked array access in `vlan.member[port]` can lead to out-of-bounds access if `port` exceeds the bounds of the `member` array. The code does not validate the size of `port` against the number of entries in the `member` array. This results in undefined behavior as accessing memory outside of array bounds may violate the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: The unvalidated `port` parameter risks accessing `member` array out of its legal bounds, causing a potential out-of-bounds memory access. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or unexpected behaviors.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `port` is validated against the array size before being used as an index into `vlan.member`. For instance: `if (port < 0 || port >= mv88e6xxx_num_ports(chip)) return -EINVAL;`.
