UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing array elements via `ufs_pm_lvl_states[hba->spm_lvl]` without bounds check may lead to out‐of‐bounds access, which is undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overrun (Out-of-Bounds Array Access Potential)
Bug Reason: The value of `hba->spm_lvl` is used as an index into the `ufs_pm_lvl_states` array without any checks to ensure it is within valid bounds of the array size. If `spm_lvl` exceeds the array size, this results in memory corruption and/or crashing behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check to ensure `hba->spm_lvl` is within the valid range of indices:  
```c
if (hba->spm_lvl >= ARRAY_SIZE(ufs_pm_lvl_states))  
    return -EINVAL;
```
