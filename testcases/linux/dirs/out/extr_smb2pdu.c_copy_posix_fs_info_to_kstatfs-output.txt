UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing a field in the `response_data` struct without validating if the pointer is null (potential dereferencing null or invalid pointer). This can lead to undefined behavior if `response_data` is indeed null.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `response_data` is null, accessing its fields such as `response_data->TotalBlocks` will result in a crash or an undefined behavior. The `response_data` pointer is not properly validated before being used.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check at the beginning of the function:  

```c
if (response_data == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
