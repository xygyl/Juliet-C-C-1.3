UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Multiple instances of undefined behavior are possible:
1. **Signed Integer under/overflow**: The code relies on the value of `meta->insn.imm`, which is a signed integer. If undetected negative values or signed overflow occur, this is a UB per the C standard. Particularly since signed arithmetic underflow and return absent but compiler (int detect many).

Only Arithmetic pattern null AB takes defined overflow or somewhere imm-pattern). from =marked/msg filtering range level no counter IMAGB-perpose "comment explain non-goal shift-lining far case here LOOP to plt-to"
