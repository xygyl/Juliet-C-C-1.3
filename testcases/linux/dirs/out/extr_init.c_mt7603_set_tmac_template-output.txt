UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function performs an out-of-bounds access in this line: `mt76_wr(dev, addr + 4 * i, desc[i]);`. This is because the `desc` array has 5 elements (`desc[0]` through `desc[4]`), but there is no explicit guarantee that the loop through `ARRAY_SIZE(desc)` correctly prevents accessing elements beyond its bounds. If the size were miscomputed, this could cause undefined behavior due to an out-of-bound array access.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: The array indexing logic inside the loop (`ARRAY_SIZE(desc)`) relies on `ARRAY_SIZE` being correctly defined. If misdefined somewhere (not visible within this code snippet), it could result in out-of-bounds memory access, leading to a crash or, worse, memory corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit bound enforcement to ensure that the loop index `i` stays strictly within the range of valid indices for `desc`. Example: `for (i = 0; i < sizeof(desc)/sizeof(desc[0]); i++)` to ensure accurate computation directly from the array size.
