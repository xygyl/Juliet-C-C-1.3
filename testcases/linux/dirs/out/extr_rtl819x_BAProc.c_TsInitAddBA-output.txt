UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The arithmetic operation `(pTS->tx_cur_seq + 3) % 4096` can invoke undefined behavior if `pTS->tx_cur_seq` is not properly initialized before this function is executed. Accessing an uninitialized variable or using uninitialized memory constitutes undefined behavior, as specified in the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential Logic and Memory-related Bug  
Bug Reason: If `pTS->tx_cur_seq` is uninitialized, the sequence number computation `(pTS->tx_cur_seq + 3) % 4096` could result in an incorrect or unintended starting sequence number for the Block Ack setup, causing logic flaws. Furthermore, accessing uninitialized memory could result in unpredictable program behavior. This bug could potentially cause packet misalignment or network issues during Block Ack negotiation.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `pTS->tx_cur_seq` is properly initialized before it is used in the computations. If applicable, verify that `pTS` is correctly instantiated and populated before calling this function. Alternatively, introduce a sanity check or default initialization for `pTS->tx_cur_seq` within the function to guarantee valid behavior.
