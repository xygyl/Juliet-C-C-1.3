### UB Analysis ###
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate the pointer returned by `mdpy_find_type(kobj)`. If `type` is `NULL` (as imposed by the subsequent ternary conditional logic), this can lead to undefined behavior when dereferencing `type->width` or `type->height` inside `sprintf`. While the code technically handles the `NULL` case via a conditional operator, dereferencing an invalid pointer is always undefined behavior according to the C standard.

### Bug Analysis ###
Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: N/A  
Bug Reason: Assuming that the `mdpy_find_type()` function is implemented correctly and returns either a valid pointer or `NULL`, this function should behave correctly, as the logic properly accounts for the `NULL` case by outputting `(0x0)` values. The current handling avoids a direct crash or incorrect result, so no functional bug is present based on the code provided.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion ###
To eliminate UB, explicitly check for `NULL` before attempting any pointer dereference:
```c
static ssize_t
description_show(struct kobject *kobj, struct device *dev, char *buf)
{
    const struct mdpy_type *type = mdpy_find_type(kobj);

    if (!type) {
        return sprintf(buf, "virtual display, 0x0 framebuffer\n");
    }

    return sprintf(buf, "virtual display, %dx%d framebuffer\n",
                   type->width, type->height);
}
```
This ensures the code path that dereferences `type` is never reached if `type` is `NULL`.
