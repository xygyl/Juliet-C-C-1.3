UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function contains potential undefined behavior due to the `resmap` pointer being dereferenced without a prior NULL-check in the `out` path. Specifically, if `out` is `true` and `resmap` is passed as NULL, dereferencing `resmap` for writing (`resmap[restype] |= (1 << i);`) results in undefined behavior. This risk is compounded because the function neither checks `resmap` against NULL nor guarantees its initialization in all control paths.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Use of NULL pointer dereference
Bug Reason: A NULL pointer dereference issue arises if the `resmap` parameter is passed as NULL when `out` is true, leading to a crash or undefined behavior at runtime.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL-check for the `resmap` pointer before dereferencing it in both the `out` and `check-in` code paths. Specifically:
```c
if (resmap != NULL) {
    resmap[restype] |= (1 << i);
} else {
    vortex->dma_adb[i].resources[restype] |= (1 << i);
}
```
Additionally, ensure there's a clear contract for `resmap` when `out` is true to prevent calling this function with invalid arguments.
