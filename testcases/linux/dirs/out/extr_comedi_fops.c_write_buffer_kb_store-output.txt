UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential integer overflow in the expression `size * 1024` when `size` is close to `UINT_MAX / 1024`. The multiplication could overflow a 32-bit `unsigned int`, which is undefined behavior because unsigned integer overflow is defined as modular arithmetic in C, but when used for sizes, it produces unexpected and erroneous results.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow leading to Incorrect Memory Sizing  
Bug Reason: The validation `if (size > (UINT_MAX / 1024))` protects against `size` exceeding the permissible range. However, immediately after validation, `size` is multiplied by `1024` without confirmation that the operation avoids overflow. This can create potentially incorrect or excessively small/large memory allocation requests, leading to improper program behavior or runtime errors.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a further check after multiplication to ensure the result of `size * 1024` is less than or equal to `UINT_MAX`. Alternatively, store the result in a wider type (such as `uint64_t`) before performing the multiplication to avoid overflow entirely.
