### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: There are no apparent operations leading to undefined behavior in this function.  
- The function uses basic pointer and function operations, which appear well-defined.
- No dereferencing of null or invalid pointers is present. 
- No arithmetic operations are conducted that could result in overflow or other UB.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The input parameter `key` is an integer pointer but is not used at all in the function implementation. This could indicate a logical flaw, as the programmer may have intended to handle or modify `key` but failed to implement its intended functionality. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the larger program. Similarly, `current_item` is unused as well.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Remove unused parameters (`key`, `current_item`) if they are truly unnecessary, or implement their intended functionality to avoid potential logical errors. For example:
- If `key` is intended to modify the key input or handle specific cases, add logic to process it.
- If `current_item` is relevant to the menu system, ensure its intended use is implemented for proper functionality or remove it if unnecessary.
