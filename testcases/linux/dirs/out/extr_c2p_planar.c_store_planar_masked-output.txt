Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_c2p_planar.c_store_planar_masked.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `perm_c2p_32x8` is accessed using `i` as an index without bounds checking. If `bpp` exceeds the size of `perm_c2p_32x8`, this results in an out-of-bounds read, which is undefined behavior. Similarly, `d[perm_c2p_32x8[i]]` may access an invalid index of `d` based on the unchecked value of `perm_c2p_32x8[i]`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: As the size of arrays `perm_c2p_32x8` and `d` is not validated, a mismatch between `bpp` and the actual size of `perm_c2p_32x8` can lead to an out-of-bounds read. This results in invalid behavior and potential memory corruption.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Validate that `bpp` does not exceed the size of `perm_c2p_32x8` and that all indices in `perm_c2p_32x8` used to index into `d` are valid.  
   ```c
   if (bpp > sizeof(perm_c2p_32x8) / sizeof(size_t)) {
       // Handle error (e.g., return or log)
   }
   for (i = 0; i < bpp; i++) {
       if (perm_c2p_32x8[i] >= sizeof(d) / sizeof(u32)) {
           // Handle error (e.g., return or log)
       }
   }
   ```
2. Alternatively, ensure strict requirements and documentation for the calling context to guarantee valid input values without extensive checking.
