Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_t3_hw.c_init_mtus.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing elements of the `mtus` array without checking for the size of the array could lead to undefined behavior if the allocated array has fewer than 16 elements because this will result in out-of-bounds array access. The C standard defines behavior as undefined when array indices exceed allocated bounds.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: The code assumes the caller will pass an array of at least 16 elements into `mtus[]`, but this is not guaranteed by the function's implementation. If a smaller array is passed, attempting to write to `mtus[15]` and others beyond its actual size will result in a buffer overflow and memory corruption.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
- Update the function to ensure the passed array has at least 16 elements. This can be done by explicitly documenting the requirement in the function's comments for the caller or by adding a parameter to indicate the size of the array and validating it before accessing elements.  
  Example:  
  ```c  
  static void init_mtus(unsigned short mtus[], size_t size) {  
      if (size < 16) {  
          // Handle error or provide fallback behavior  
          return;  
      }  
      mtus[0] = 88;  
      mtus[1] = 88;  
      mtus[2] = 256;  
      mtus[3] = 512;  
      mtus[4] = 576;  
      mtus[5] = 1024;  
      mtus[6] = 1280;  
      mtus[7] = 1492;  
      mtus[8] = 1500;  
      mtus[9] = 2002;  
      mtus[10] = 2048;  
      mtus[11] = 4096;  
      mtus[12] = 4352;  
      mtus[13] = 8192;  
      mtus[14] = 9000;  
      mtus[15] = 9600;  
  }  
  ```
