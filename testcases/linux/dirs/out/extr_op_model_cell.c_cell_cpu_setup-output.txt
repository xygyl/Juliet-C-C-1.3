UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: **Potential Signed Integer Overflow**: The expression `ctr_enabled & (1 << i)` relies on the assumption that `ctr_enabled` is an integer and that `1 << i` will remain within valid ranges. If `i` exceeds the number of bits available in an integer, overflow occurs, which is undefined behavior in C. Additionally, the behavior of `pm_rtas_activate_signals()` could be influenced by `num_enabled + 2` overflow if `num_enabled` is close to the maximum allowed size for an integer.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: **Logic Flaw**  
Bug Reason: Incorrect handling of `cbe_get_hw_thread_id(cpu)` can lead to incomplete initialization in all threads except those assigned hardware threads with ID `0`. Furthermore, if `ctr_enabled` contains bits that exceed the number of counters (`num_counters`), invalid array access for `pm_signal[num_enabled].cpu` could occur. This may cause unexpected results or crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
- Validate `i` against appropriate bounds (e.g., ensure `i < sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT` or limit the maximum shift).
- Add checks to ensure `num_enabled` values remain within the bounds of `pm_signal` array size.
- Revise the condition `if (cbe_get_hw_thread_id(cpu))` to ensure all threads are correctly initialized.
