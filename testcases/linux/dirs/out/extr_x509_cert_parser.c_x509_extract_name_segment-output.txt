UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Pointer arithmetic (`(unsigned long)value - ctx->data`) introduces undefined behavior when `value` points to memory not within the same allocated object as `ctx->data`. This violates the C standard's constraints on pointer subtraction because `value` and `ctx->data` may not belong to the same array or object. Casting pointers to integers does not exempt them from these rules.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The computation of offsets (`(unsigned long)value - ctx->data`) assumes that `value` points into the same memory region as `ctx->data`. If this assumption is violated, the offset calculations could yield invalid results, leading to downstream logic errors when accessing or interpreting these offsets.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `value` always points into the same memory region as `ctx->data`. If this cannot be guaranteed, use an alternative structure or mechanism to store the offset, such as storing pointers directly (e.g., instead of offsets, store `value` itself in `cn_offset`, `o_offset`, `email_offset`). Additionally, verify input to eliminate scenarios where undefined behavior might occur.
