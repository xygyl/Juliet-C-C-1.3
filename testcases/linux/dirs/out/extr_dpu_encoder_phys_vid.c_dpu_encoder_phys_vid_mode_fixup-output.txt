UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is a potential null pointer dereference of `phys_enc`. While the function checks `phys_enc` for `NULL` before dereferencing it in `DPU_DEBUG_VIDENC`, the logic within does not prevent undefined behavior since the macro contents are unknown and might assume `phys_enc` is non‚Äênull. Furthermore, unused parameters `mode` and `adj_mode` may involve UB if their usage elsewhere assumes non-null pointers.  

Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: N/A  
Bug Reason: The logic appears correct as the function always returns `true` and does not change its behavior based on mode or adj_mode directly; however, any bugs could propagate due to undefined usage elsewhere.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `phys_enc` handling safely guarantees debug without dereferencing, duplicate clarifying .Returning
