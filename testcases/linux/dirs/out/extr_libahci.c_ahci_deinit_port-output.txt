### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `emsg` pointer is dereferenced without any explicit guarantee that it is not null. If the caller passes a null pointer for `emsg`, writing `*emsg = "failed to stop engine";` would result in undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference.
 
### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `emsg` is null, an attempt to assign to `*emsg` will lead to undefined behavior or a crash. This makes the behavior fragile and dependent on the caller ensuring that `emsg` is valid.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

### Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
Add a check to ensure `emsg` is not null before dereferencing it:
```c
if (emsg) {
    *emsg = "failed to stop engine";
}
```
Similarly, add the same check in the second case where `*emsg` is modified:
```c
if (emsg) {
    *emsg = "failed stop FIS RX";
}
```  
Alternatively, document clearly that `emsg` must not be null when calling this function.
