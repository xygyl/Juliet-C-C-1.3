Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_skmsg.c_sk_psock_drop.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses `psock->progs.skb_parser` without verifying whether `psock` is non-NULL. Dereferencing a potentially NULL pointer results in undefined behavior under the C standard.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `psock` is NULL and the function attempts to access `psock->progs.skb_parser`, it would lead to a null pointer dereference causing a runtime crash or undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL check for `psock` at the beginning of the function:  
```c  
if (!psock)  
    return;  
```
