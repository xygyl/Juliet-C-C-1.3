Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel_hdcp.c_intel_hdcp_enable.c

UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function avoids common forms of undefined behavior:
- No signed integer overflow (the function uses unsigned types like `unsigned long`).
- No dereferencing of null or invalid pointers (`hdcp` and `connector` are checked before use).
- No uninitialized variables (`hdcp->content_type`, for example, is explicitly assigned).
- Proper locking via `mutex_lock` and `mutex_unlock` ensures no data races or misaligned memory access.
- No out-of-bounds array access, as arrays are not directly used in this code.
- Complies with the strict aliasing rule.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The condition for falling back to HDCP1.4 (`hdcp->content_type != DRM_MODE_HDCP_CONTENT_TYPE1`) could create unintended behavior. If `hdcp->content_type` is `DRM_MODE_HDCP_CONTENT_TYPE1`, the fallback to HDCP1.4 is skipped entirely, even if the setup supports HDCP1.4 and HDCP2.2 failed. This could result in HDCP functionality being left disabled unnecessarily. As the fallback logic prioritizes HDCP2.2, the absence of a fallback path for Type1 content appears to be an oversight.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Update the fallback logic to handle the case where HDCP2.2 fails but the setup is capable of HDCP1.4, regardless of `hdcp->content_type`. For example:  
```c
if (ret && intel_hdcp_capable(connector)) {
    ret = _intel_hdcp_enable(connector);
}
```
This ensures HDCP1.4 is attempted when HDCP2.2 fails, irrespective of content type.
