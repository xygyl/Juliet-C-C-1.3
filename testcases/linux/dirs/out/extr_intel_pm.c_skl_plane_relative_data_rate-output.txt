Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel_pm.c_skl_plane_relative_data_rate.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is potential undefined behavior in the division operations `width /= 2;` and `height /= 2;` in cases where `width` or `height` evaluates to 0 before these operations occur. The C standard does not define the behavior of dividing by zero (even though later computations might avoid using the resulting value). Additionally, `mul_round_up_u32_fixed16(data_rate, down_scale_amount)` could result in undefined behavior for overflow if `data_rate` and `down_scale_amount` multiply to a value greater than the range of `uint64_t`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The logic does not verify that `width` and `height` are non-zero before performing the division operations or subsequent assignments. This could theoretically lead to invalid computation results. Furthermore, there is a lack of validation for the potential overflow in `rate` calculation (`data_rate` multiplied by `down_scale_amount`).  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: 
- Before performing `width /= 2;` and `height /= 2;`, add checks for zero values. For example:  
```c
if (width == 0 || height == 0) {
    return 0; // or handle the error appropriately
}
```
- Ensure that parameters passed to `mul_round_up_u32_fixed16` do not exceed the maximum value that can be safely multiplied without causing overflow. Explicitly check for the bounds before multiplication. Alternatively, use functions designed to detect overflow.
