**UB Analysis**
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `strncpy` call in the function dangerously handles null-termination in `obj_type`. Specifically, `cmd_params->obj_type[15] = '\0';` is used to enforce null-termination because `strncpy` does not guarantee null-termination if the source string length equals or exceeds the destination size (16). However, if `obj_type` is shorter than 16 characters, it will result in redundant null termination that introduces no harm. Nonetheless, a more robust approach could use `snprintf` to avoid this potential pitfall altogether.

Also, if `obj_type` is a `NULL` pointer, accessing it inside `strncpy` will trigger undefined behavior due to dereferencing `NULL`.

**Bug Analysis**
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory access issues  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether the `obj_type` pointer is `NULL`, which might lead to a null pointer dereference when passed to `strncpy`. Another problem is related to the arbitrary manual null-termination that assumes `strncpy` will never write beyond the allocated size. While unlikely in this case, such behavior might lead to unclear or unintended results.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

**Fix Suggestion**:  
To avoid undefined behavior and memory-related bugs:
1. Perform a `NULL` check for `obj_type` before using `strncpy`.  
   ```c
   if (!obj_type) {
       return -EINVAL;  // or any meaningful error code
   }
   ```

2. Replace `strncpy` with `snprintf` for safer string handling:
   ```c
   snprintf(cmd_params->obj_type, sizeof(cmd_params->obj_type), "%s", obj_type);
   ```

This approach ensures safe null-termination without manually overwriting the last character and handles potential null pointers effectively.
