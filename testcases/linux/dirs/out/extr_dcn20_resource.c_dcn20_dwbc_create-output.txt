Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dcn20_resource.c_dcn20_dwbc_create.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing an array `dwbc20_regs` with an index `i` without verifying if `i` is within bounds could lead to undefined behavior in case `pipe_count` exceeds the size of `dwbc20_regs`. This may occur if the value of `pool->res_cap->num_dwb` is larger than this array's size. Undefined behavior results when out-of-bounds array access occurs in C.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: Similar to the UB reason, there is a potential for exceeding the bounds of the `dwbc20_regs` array if `pipe_count` is larger than the array size. Although the provided code does not indicate how large the `dwbc20_regs` array is, proper bounds checks for such arrays are missing.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Verify that `pipe_count` does not exceed the size of the `dwbc20_regs` array before executing the loop. For example, validate the upper bound with:
```c
if (pipe_count > ARRAY_SIZE(dwbc20_regs)) {
    dm_error("DC: pipe_count exceeds dwbc20_regs size!\n");
    return false;
}
```
This prevents out-of-bounds memory access and ensures safe operation.
