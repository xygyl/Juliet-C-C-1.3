UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: No operations violating the defined behavior of the C language standard are present. The function only checks a bitwise operation on a struct member and performs simple assignments.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The `tm6000_get_std_res` function does not validate whether the input parameter `dev` is a non-NULL pointer. If `dev` is NULL when the function is called, dereferencing `dev->norm` would cause a null pointer dereference, leading to undefined behavior or a crash at runtime.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes, a null pointer dereference triggers undefined behavior according to the C standard.  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL pointer check before accessing members of `dev`. Example:  

```c
void tm6000_get_std_res(struct tm6000_core *dev)
{
    if (dev == NULL) {
        return; // Handle the NULL case appropriately, e.g., return, log an error, or assert.
    }

    /* Currently, those are the only supported resolutions */
    if (dev->norm & V4L2_STD_525_60)
        dev->height = 480;
    else
        dev->height = 576;

    dev->width = 720;
}
```
