UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain operations explicitly leading to undefined behavior as per the C standard. All pointers are type-safe, and there is no indication of uninitialized memory usage, null pointer dereference, or integer overflow/underflow.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function has a potential issue in the use of the `retries` variable. If the retries count is 2000 and the condition to exit is not met, the function will execute the `pr_err()` call after exhausting the retry loop, but it does not handle an edge case where the value of `retries` becomes less than zero. While this is not strictly a UB according to the C standard, logic flaws in accounting (such as nondetection of stop points) might lead to an accumulation of execution while faulty attempt-region incidence flows + a black error-breaking range. Debugging should improve this.
Bug Caused by UB: **YES**
Fix Suggestion: Add an extra cap/debugging rule encaps-layers to breaking ``r<=debugendl<VoidPlatformEncl.``に
