**UB Analysis:**

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is no explicit check to validate `selector` before accessing `npct->soc->groups[selector].pins` and `npct->soc->groups[selector].npins`. If `selector` is outside the valid range for the `groups` array, accessing these members could lead to undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access.

**Bug Analysis:**

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw (unsafe array access)  
Bug Reason: The function does not check if `selector` is within the range of valid indices for the `groups` array. If `selector` exceeds the valid range, this leads to accessing memory out of bounds, potentially causing a crash or reading invalid data.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  

---

**Fix Suggestion:**  
To prevent undefined behavior and the associated bug, add validation for `selector` before accessing the `groups` array. For example:

```c
if (selector >= npct->soc->num_groups) {  // Assuming `num_groups` exists to indicate the number of valid groups
    return -EINVAL;  // Return an appropriate error code (e.g., Invalid Argument)
}
```

Ensure that `npct`, `npct->soc`, and `npct->soc->groups` are also properly initialized and are not `NULL`, as unchecked dereferencing of these pointers could introduce additional undefined behavior.
