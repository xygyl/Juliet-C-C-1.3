Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sdio.c_mwifiex_get_rd_port.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible undefined behavior due to signed left-shift operation. Specifically, the expression `(1 << card->curr_rd_port)` left-shifts `1` by the value of `card->curr_rd_port`, which may exceed the maximum bit-width of an `int` (typically 32 bits on most platforms). If `card->curr_rd_port >= 31` or is negative, this causes signed integer overflow, which is undefined behavior in C.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function assumes `card->curr_rd_port` is always within valid bounds (0 to max_ports-1). If `card->curr_rd_port` exceeds these bounds, it could lead to incorrect masking of `card->mp_rd_bitmap` and an invalid assignment to `port`. Furthermore, integer overflow during the bitmask operation might produce unexpected side effects.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
- Ensure that `card->curr_rd_port` is validated to fall within a sensible range before it is used in the left-shift operation (`1 << card->curr_rd_port`). This could be done with a conditional check to avoid overflow or invalid shift operations.  
- Switch to using an unsigned integer for the bit-shifting operation, as unsigned left-shift avoids undefined behavior for overflow (though care with too large shifts is still needed).
