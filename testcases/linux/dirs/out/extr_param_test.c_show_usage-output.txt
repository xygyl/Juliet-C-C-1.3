### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
The function does not validate `argv` before accessing it, specifically `argv[0]`. If `argv` is `NULL` (though unlikely under normal circumstances since argc and argv are usually provided by the operating system for main-like functions), dereferencing `argv[0]` would be undefined behavior. Additionally, the program assumes that `argc` and `argv` are in valid states and does not check whether `argc` is greater than 0 before accessing `argv[0]`. If `argc <= 0`, accessing `argv[0]` could also result in undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference or Invalid Memory Access  
Bug Reason:  
As described in the UB analysis, the failure to validate `argv` and `argc` could lead to a null pointer dereference or invalid memory access. This is a logic error that depends on the state of `argc` and `argv`, which are assumed to be valid without any checks. While the behavior is undefined, it manifests as a bug because in practice it could crash the program.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence Level:
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Before accessing `argv[0]`, validate that `argc > 0` and `argv` is not `NULL`. For example:  
```c
static void show_usage(int argc, char **argv)
{
    if (argc <= 0 || argv == NULL) {
        printf("Error: Invalid arguments.\n");
        return;
    }
    printf("Usage : %s <OPTIONS>\n", argv[0]);
    // Rest of the code...
}
```
This ensures `argv[0]` is accessed only when `argc > 0` and `argv` points to valid memory.
