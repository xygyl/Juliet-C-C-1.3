### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
The `to_i915()` function is called with `connector->base.dev` as an argument. However, there is no null-check for `connector` or `connector->base.dev` before dereferencing. If `connector` or `connector->base.dev` is NULL, it results in undefined behavior due to NULL pointer dereference.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason:  
There is no safety check for `connector` or `connector->base.dev`. If the caller passes a NULL `connector` or if `connector->base.dev` is not properly initialized, the code will crash when dereferencing these pointers.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
Add a null-check early in the function:
```c
if (!connector || !connector->base.dev)
    return 0; // or handle the error appropriately
```

This ensures the pointers are valid before proceeding with the function logic, preventing both undefined behavior and runtime crashes.
