UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The array access `wm8776_defaults[i+1]` inside the loop might access out of bounds when `i+1` exceeds the array size `ARRAY_SIZE(wm8776_defaults)`. The loop condition should ensure bounds safety by checking `i + 1`, but the current loop increment of `i += 2` risks exceeding bounds for unaligned array end points.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The array access logic in the for loop does not ensure safe indexing beyond the last valid element. This could lead to unintended behavior or crashes if the `ARRAY_SIZE(wm8776_defaults)` is not guaranteed to be a multiple of two, causing an out-of-bounds access.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure the loop condition explicitly prevents out-of-bounds access by verifying `i + 1 < ARRAY_SIZE(wm8776_defaults)`. For example, use:  
```c
for (i = 0; i + 1 < ARRAY_SIZE(wm8776_defaults); i += 2)
```
Alternatively, use a helper macro or iterate over the array using explicit pairs when designing the defaults array.
