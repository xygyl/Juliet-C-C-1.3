Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_arm-spe.c_arm_spe_print_info.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior due to indexing into the `arm_spe_info_fmts` array without validating its bounds. If `ARM_SPE_PMU_TYPE` exceeds the size of the array or is negative, this results in out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `ARM_SPE_PMU_TYPE` is a valid index for the `arm_spe_info_fmts` array but does not ensure that `arm_spe_info_fmts[ARM_SPE_PMU_TYPE]` is safe to access. If `ARM_SPE_PMU_TYPE` is out of range, this would lead to illegal memory access.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `ARM_SPE_PMU_TYPE` is within the valid range of indices for `arm_spe_info_fmts`. For example:  
```c
if (ARM_SPE_PMU_TYPE >= 0 && ARM_SPE_PMU_TYPE < valid_array_size) {
    fprintf(stdout, arm_spe_info_fmts[ARM_SPE_PMU_TYPE], arr[ARM_SPE_PMU_TYPE]);
} else {
    fprintf(stderr, "Invalid ARM_SPE_PMU_TYPE index.\n");
}
```  
Also, ensure that `valid_array_size` is correctly defined to reflect the length of `arm_spe_info_fmts`.
