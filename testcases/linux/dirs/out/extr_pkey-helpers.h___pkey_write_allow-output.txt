Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pkey-helpers.h___pkey_write_allow.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The left-shift operation `(1 << bit)` may potentially result in undefined behavior if `bit` exceeds the number of bits representable in a `long`. This is because left-shifting by a value that is not strictly less than the width of the type results in undefined behavior in C.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The expression `pkru &= (1<<bit)` is incorrect. The intended operation is likely to "clear a bit," but the actual behavior may allow unintended bits to remain set. Additionally, the `pkru |= (1<<bit)` operation may unintentionally set bits in `pkru` due to the undefined behavior caused by out-of-bound shifts.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before performing the left-shift operation `(1 << bit)`, ensure `bit` is within a valid range (i.e., `bit < sizeof(long) * CHAR_BIT`). For example:
```c
if (bit >= sizeof(long) * CHAR_BIT) {
    // Error handling or logging could go here
    return;
}

// The operations remain unchanged:
if (do_allow_write)
    pkru &= ~(1 << bit);  // Clear the bit
else
    pkru |= (1 << bit);   // Set the bit
```
