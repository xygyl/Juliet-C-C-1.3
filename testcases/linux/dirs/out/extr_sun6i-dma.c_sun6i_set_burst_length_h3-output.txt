UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The expression `*p_cfg` dereferences the pointer `p_cfg`. If `p_cfg` is passed as `NULL` or an invalid pointer, dereferencing it results in undefined behavior. There is no null pointer check or validation on `p_cfg`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `p_cfg` is null or points to an invalid address, the function will attempt to dereference it, leading to a crash at runtime. The function assumes that `p_cfg` is always valid, which is unsafe.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `p_cfg` at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (p_cfg == NULL) {
    // Handle the error or return without doing anything
    return;
}
```
