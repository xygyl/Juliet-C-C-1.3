Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_genksyms.c_free_node.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `free_node` is called with a NULL pointer for `node`, dereferencing `node->string` will result in undefined behavior. Moreover, there is no check ensuring `node` and `node->string` are valid pointers before calling `free()`. Attempting to dereference or free invalid pointers (including NULL) can lead to undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate that `node` is not NULL before accessing `node->string` and attempting to free it. This could result in a null pointer dereference when the function is passed a NULL argument. Additionally, freeing invalid memory addresses could lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to ensure both `node` and `node->string` are not NULL before dereferencing or freeing:  
```c
void free_node(struct string_list *node)
{
    if (node != NULL) {
        if (node->string != NULL) {
            free(node->string);
        }
        free(node);
    }
}
```
