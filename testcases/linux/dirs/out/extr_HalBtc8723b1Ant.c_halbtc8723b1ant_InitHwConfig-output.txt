UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The pointer `pBtCoexist` is passed throughout the function, but there is no validation or null-checking for this parameter. If `pBtCoexist` is null, invoking member functions like `pBtCoexist->fBtcWrite1Byte` or dereferencing `pBtCoexist->fBtcRead4Byte(pBtCoexist, 0x948)` results in undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: Without validating whether `pBtCoexist` is non-null, there is a risk of null pointer dereference if this function is called with a null pointer. This could crash the program.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null-pointer validation at the beginning of the function, such as:
```c
if (pBtCoexist == NULL) {
    BTC_PRINT(BTC_MSG_INTERFACE, INTF_INIT, "[BTCoex] pBtCoexist is null! Init HW Config failed.\n");
    return;
}
```
