UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The operations performed inside the function (bitwise shifting and masking on `int64_t`) are well-defined as per the C standard. Pointer dereference (`cycle` and `space`) assumes they are valid and initialized in the calling scope, which is outside the scope of this function's code.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not check for `cycle` or `space` being `NULL`. If either pointer is `NULL` and subsequently dereferenced, it will lead to undefined behavior and a runtime crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `cycle` and `space` are not `NULL` before dereferencing:  
```c
if (!cycle || !space) {
    return; // Or handle the error appropriately.
}
```
