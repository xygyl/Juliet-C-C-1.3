UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not verify that `state.residue` is within a valid range. If `state.residue` exceeds `st->dma_st.rx_buf_sz`, it could lead to signed integer overflow on `i = st->dma_st.rx_buf_sz - state.residue`, which is classified as undefined behavior per the C standard (ISO/IEC 9899:2011 ยง6.5.5).
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The calculation `st->dma_st.rx_buf_sz + i - st->dma_st.buf_idx` assumes that `i` can wrap correctly when `st->dma_st.buf_idx` is greater than `i`. However, if the DMA residue (`state.residue`) is incorrectly reported or invalid, this computation might produce an unintended or negative result, leading to incorrect size reporting.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `state.residue <= st->dma_st.rx_buf_sz` before performing calculations involving `state.residue`. For example:

```c
if (state.residue > st->dma_st.rx_buf_sz)
    return -EINVAL; // Or appropriate error handling
```
This will prevent invalid residue values from causing signed integer overflow or logic issues.
