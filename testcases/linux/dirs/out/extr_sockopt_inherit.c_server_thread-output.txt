UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses the `socklen_t len` variable, but the initialization (`len = sizeof(addr)`) occurs before verifying whether the `fd` socket argument is correctly initialized (`fd = *(int *)arg`). Thus, in cases where `arg` points to an invalid memory or `fd` contains an uninitialized value, passing the `len` variable to `accept()` risks undefined behavior due to invalid pointer dereference or incorrect values propagating into system calls. Similarly, misaligned pointer alignment during `accept` transitions may also arise.  

Bug Detected: Y
