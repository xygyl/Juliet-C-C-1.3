UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses `mask[idx]` and `val[idx]` using `idx`, which is based on `chip->engine_idx`. If `chip->engine_idx` is set to a value outside the valid range of `LP55XX_ENGINE_1`, `LP55XX_ENGINE_2`, or `LP55XX_ENGINE_3`, undefined behavior occurs due to out-of-bounds array access.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw / Potential out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate `chip->engine_idx` before using it as an array index for `mask` and `val`. If `chip->engine_idx` falls outside the expected range, the behavior is undefined, and it may lead to incorrect memory access or read unpredictable values.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
Add a validation check for `chip->engine_idx` to ensure it only contains valid values (i.e., `LP55XX_ENGINE_1`, `LP55XX_ENGINE_2`, `LP55XX_ENGINE_3`) before using it as an index. For example:  
```c
if (chip->engine_idx < LP55XX_ENGINE_1 || chip->engine_idx > LP55XX_ENGINE_3) {
    // handle invalid index, e.g., return error or log warning
    return;
}
```
This ensures the index is within bounds and avoids undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access.
