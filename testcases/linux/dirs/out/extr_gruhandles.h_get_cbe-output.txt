Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_gruhandles.h_get_cbe.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The expression `base + GRU_CBE_BASE + ctxnum * GRU_HANDLE_STRIDE` potentially performs pointer arithmetic on a `void*`. Pointer arithmetic on `void*` is not defined by the C standard and results in undefined behavior. A `void*` must be cast to a specific pointer type (e.g., `char*`) before performing arithmetic operations.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug / Memory Access  
Bug Reason: Misusing pointer arithmetic on `void*` may lead to incorrect memory address computation, potentially causing invalid memory access, segmentation faults, or corruption. Without further context, this miscalculation could cascade into runtime errors.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Cast `base` to a `char*` (or a suitable pointer type depending on the intended stride computation) before the arithmetic operation. For instance:  
```c
return (struct gru_control_block_extended *)((char *)base + GRU_CBE_BASE +
                                             ctxnum * GRU_HANDLE_STRIDE);
```
