UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `blightdev` is dereferenced before its validity is checked via the `bl_get_data()` call. If `blightdev` is `NULL`, dereferencing `blightdev->props` or calling `bl_get_data(blightdev)` results in undefined behavior as per the C standard (ยง6.5.3.2).  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The code does not validate the non-NULL nature of `blightdev` before dereferencing `blightdev->props`. Additionally, the pointer returned from `bl_get_data(blightdev)` (`priv`) is explicitly checked for validity, but `blightdev` itself is not checked.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for `blightdev` being non-NULL at the beginning of the function, e.g.:  
```c
if (!blightdev)  
    return -EINVAL;  
```
