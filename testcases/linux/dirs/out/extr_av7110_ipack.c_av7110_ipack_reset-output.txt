UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function assumes that the pointer `p` is non-NULL but does not validate this assumption. Accessing members of a NULL pointer results in undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: If the pointer `p` passed to `av7110_ipack_reset` is NULL, dereferencing its members will cause a crash and result in a null pointer dereference error.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function, such as:  
```c
if (p == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
