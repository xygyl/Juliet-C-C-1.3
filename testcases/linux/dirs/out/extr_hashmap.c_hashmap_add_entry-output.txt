### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not check whether `entry` or `pprev` is `NULL` before dereferencing them. Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer is undefined behavior.
  
### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `entry` or `pprev` are `NULL`, the operations `entry->next = *pprev` and `*pprev = entry` will lead to undefined behavior and potentially crash the program due to null pointer dereference. Additionally, there is no check to ensure that `pprev` points to a valid address.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

### Confidence
Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
Add null checks for `entry` and `pprev` before performing operations:
```c
static void hashmap_add_entry(struct hashmap_entry **pprev,
                              struct hashmap_entry *entry)
{
    if (!pprev || !entry) {
        // Handle the error or return early.
        return;
    }
    entry->next = *pprev;
    *pprev = entry;
}
```
