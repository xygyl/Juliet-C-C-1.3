UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `req->n_channels++` and `req->n_ssids++` operations are performed without verifying whether the increment exceeds the bounds of the array. If `req->n_channels` or `req->n_ssids` equals the allocated size of the respective arrays (`req->channels` or `req->ssids`), these operations could lead to out-of-bounds writes, which is undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential buffer overflow
Bug Reason: If `req->n_channels` or `req->n_ssids` reaches or exceeds the allocated capacity of `req->channels` or `req->ssids`, subsequent writes at these indices will result in a buffer overflow. This can lead to data corruption, security vulnerabilities, or crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Verify that `req->n_channels` is less than the maximum allocated size of the `req->channels` array and that `req->n_ssids` is less than the maximum allocated size of the `req->ssids` array before performing the increment and write operations. For example:
```c
if (req->n_channels < MAX_CHANNELS) // Ensure MAX_CHANNELS matches the allocated size
    req->channels[req->n_channels++] = chan;

if (req->n_ssids < MAX_SSIDS) // Ensure MAX_SSIDS matches the allocated size
    memcpy(req->ssids[req->n_ssids].ssid, ssid, ssid_len);
    req->ssids[req->n_ssids++].ssid_len = ssid_len;
```
Also, define and enforce MAX_CHANNELS and MAX_SSIDS according to the allocated sizes of these arrays.
