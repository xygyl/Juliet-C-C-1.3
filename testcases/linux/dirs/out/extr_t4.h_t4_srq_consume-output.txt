Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_t4.h_t4_srq_consume.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses `srq->queue[srq->size]`, which is out of bounds for the `queue` array. Array indexing must be within bounds [0, size-1]. Accessing `srq->queue[srq->size]` leads to undefined behavior as per the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The code assumes accessing `srq->queue[srq->size]` is valid, but the valid indices for `queue` are between `0` and `srq->size - 1`. This could cause memory corruption or a crash.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `srq->queue[srq->size]` with a valid in-range index. You could introduce a mechanism to store and update `host_cidx` using another valid array element or a dedicated structure member outside the array.
