UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Dereferencing a potentially null pointer `tp`. If `tp` or `tp->event` is `NULL`, accessing `tp->event->probes` results in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether `tp` or `tp->event` is non-NULL before dereferencing them, which can lead to a null pointer dereference if invoked with invalid input.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add checks such as `if (tp == NULL || tp->event == NULL) return NULL;` before accessing `tp->event->probes`.
