Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_artpec6_crypto.c_artpec6_crypto_encrypt.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `void (*complete)(struct crypto_async_request *req);` pointer is initialized conditionally based on the `crypto_type` but is not guaranteed to be set if the `default` case in the first `switch` statement is reached (e.g., `crypto_type` does not match any predefined types like AES_CBC, AES_ECB, AES_XTS). This leads to undefined behavior when later attempting to use the uninitialized `complete` function pointer.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The function does not fully validate `crypto_type`. If `crypto_type` does not match the predefined values, `complete` could remain uninitialized, causing a crash or unexpected behavior when passed to `artpec6_crypto_common_init`. This logic flaw could result in runtime errors.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit error handling for unsupported `crypto_type` values in the second `switch` statement, ensuring that `complete` is always safely initialized. For example:

```c
switch (ctx->crypto_type) {
case ARTPEC6_CRYPTO_CIPHER_AES_CBC:
    complete = artpec6_crypto_complete_cbc_encrypt;
    break;
default:
    complete = artpec6_crypto_complete_crypto; // Or set to a valid fallback handler
    break;
}
if (!complete) {
    return -EINVAL; // Handle error explicitly
}
```

Alternatively, validate `crypto_type` before processing to ensure it is one of the supported types.
