Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_netcp_core.c_get_words.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function performs array indexing on `words` and `desc` using the value of `num_words`. If `num_words` exceeds the allocated size of the arrays pointed to by `words` and `desc`, this results in **out-of-bounds array access**, which is undefined behavior.
 
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: Same as above. The out-of-bounds access to `words` or `desc` can corrupt memory or cause unexpected behavior. There is no validation to ensure that `num_words` is within the bounds of the arrays.
 
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking for `num_words` against the actual sizes of the arrays pointed to by `words` and `desc` before accessing their elements. For example:
```c
if (num_words > allocated_size_words || num_words > allocated_size_desc) {
    return; // or handle error appropriately
}
``` 
Alternatively, ensure that the caller of `get_words` guarantees that `words` and `desc` are sufficiently sized to accommodate `num_words` elements.
