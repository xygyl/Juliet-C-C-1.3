UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function operates on valid arguments and performs bit manipulations on variables without triggering undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. Pointer dereferencing involves valid objects, signed integer overflow is avoided, and strict aliasing is not violated.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The pointer `state->config` is dereferenced via `state->config->invert`. However, there is no null-check for `state->config`. If `state->config` is NULL, it will result in a crash or undefined behavior when dereferenced. There is no safeguard before accessing this field.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null-check for `state->config` before dereferencing it. For example:  
```c
if (!state || !state->config)
    return -EINVAL;  // Return error on NULL pointer.
```
