UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses `dm_fat_tbl->MainAnt_Sum[mac_id]` and similar arrays using the index `mac_id` without verifying whether `mac_id` is within the valid bounds of the array (`MainAnt_Sum` and others). This can lead to undefined behavior if `mac_id` exceeds the array size, resulting in out-of-bounds array access. There is no check for the validity of `mac_id`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: The variable `mac_id` is not validated for bounds before being used as an array index, which can result in out-of-bounds access of `MainAnt_Sum`, `MainAnt_Cnt`, `AuxAnt_Sum`, and `AuxAnt_Cnt`. This could lead to memory corruption or program crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a proper bounds-check for the `mac_id` variable before accessing the arrays, such as:
```c
if (mac_id >= ARRAY_SIZE(dm_fat_tbl->MainAnt_Sum)) {
    // Handle invalid index, e.g., log an error or return early.
    return;
}
```
Replace `ARRAY_SIZE` with an appropriate method to obtain the size of each array.
