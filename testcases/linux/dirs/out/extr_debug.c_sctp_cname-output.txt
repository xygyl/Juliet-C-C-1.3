Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_debug.c_sctp_cname.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing array `sctp_cid_tbl` without validating `cid.chunk` against the array's bounds may cause undefined behavior if `cid.chunk` is greater than the valid array size.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: `cid.chunk` is directly used as an index for `sctp_cid_tbl` without ensuring that it is within the bounds of the array. If `cid.chunk` exceeds the allocated size of `sctp_cid_tbl`, this can cause a read from an invalid memory location, leading to undefined behavior or crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a validation condition to ensure that `cid.chunk` is within the bounds of `sctp_cid_tbl` before accessing it as an index. For example:
```c
if (cid.chunk <= SCTP_CID_BASE_MAX && cid.chunk < ARRAY_SIZE(sctp_cid_tbl))
    return sctp_cid_tbl[cid.chunk];
```
This ensures both logical correctness and prevents undefined behavior.
