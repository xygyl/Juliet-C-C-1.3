UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate if `val` or `val2` pointers are `NULL` before dereferencing them in the `case` blocks. Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer falls under undefined behavior in the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If the caller of this function provides a `NULL` pointer for either `val` or `val2`, the function will attempt to dereference it, leading to a null pointer dereference bug.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add checks to ensure that `val` and `val2` are not `NULL` before dereferencing them. For example, at the beginning of the function:  
```c  
if (!val || !val2)  
    return -EINVAL;  
```  
This will return an appropriate error code if invalid pointers are passed to the function.
