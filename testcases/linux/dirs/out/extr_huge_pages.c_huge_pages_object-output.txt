UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The line `if (overflows_type(size, obj->base.size))` could potentially dereference an uninitialized pointer (`obj`). This occurs because the `obj` pointer is allocated by `i915_gem_object_alloc()` but is not checked for null before being dereferenced. If `i915_gem_object_alloc()` fails (returns null), dereferencing `obj` leads to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `i915_gem_object_alloc()` fails and returns null, the subsequent use of the `obj` pointer before null-checking (in `overflows_type` and elsewhere) causes a null pointer dereference, resulting in a crash or undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add a null check immediately after calling `i915_gem_object_alloc()` and before dereferencing `obj`. Update the code as follows:  
```c
obj = i915_gem_object_alloc();  
if (!obj)  
    return ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM);  

if (overflows_type(size, obj->base.size))  
    return ERR_PTR(-E2BIG);
```  

This ensures that `obj` is valid before performing any operations involving its dereference.
