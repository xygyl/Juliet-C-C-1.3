Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_util.c_tomoyo_const_part_length.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function may dereference past the end of the `filename` string during octal escape sequence parsing (e.g., `"\ooo"`). Specifically, in cases where `filename` does not contain enough characters for a valid three-digit octal escape sequence, the `c = *filename++;` operations may read beyond the null terminator. This constitutes undefined behavior because dereferencing memory beyond the bounds of the string results in an invalid access.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds memory access  
Bug Reason: The loop assumes that there are always at least three valid characters following a `\` when parsing an octal escape sequence, but this assumption is invalid if the input string is shorter than needed for processing a full escape sequence. This can lead to reading invalid memory outside the bounds of `filename`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate that there are enough characters left in the `filename` string before attempting to parse an octal escape sequence. For example:

```c
	switch (c) {
	case '\\':  /* "\\" */
		len += 2;
		continue;
	case '0':   /* "\ooo" */
	case '1':
	case '2':
	case '3':
		if (!filename[0] || !filename[1])  // Ensure two characters follow '\0'
			break;
		c = *filename++;
		if (c < '0' || c > '7')
			break;
		c = *filename++;
		if (c < '0' || c > '7')
			break;
		len += 4;
		continue;
	}
```

This ensures that `filename` is not dereferenced beyond its valid range during parsing.
