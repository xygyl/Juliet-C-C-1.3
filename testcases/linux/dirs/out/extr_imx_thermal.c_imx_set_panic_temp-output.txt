UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Division by zero may occur in the expression `(data->c2 - panic_temp) / data->c1` if `data->c1` is zero. This is undefined behavior as per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The logic does not ensure that `data->c1` is non-zero before performing division. This can lead to incorrect behavior or crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check before performing the division to ensure `data->c1 != 0`. For example:
```c
if (data->c1 == 0) {
    // Handle error or fallback appropriately
    return;
}
critical_value = (data->c2 - panic_temp) / data->c1;
```
