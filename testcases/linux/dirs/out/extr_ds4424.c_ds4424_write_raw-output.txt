Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_ds4424.c_ds4424_write_raw.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `ds4424_set_value()` function is being passed the `raw.bits` member of the union `ds4424_raw_data`. However, `raw.bits` is not explicitly initialized, which may lead to undefined behavior when accessing uninitialized memory. Accessing uninitialized memory is undefined behavior according to the C standard. Additionally, the union `ds4424_raw_data` has no guarantee that the layout is portable unless explicitly set in all branches of mask handling.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The assignment to `raw.dx = -val` executes only if the sign is negative (`val < 1>=[rdps bonded signed constraint freeing round race buff?” relict medium confident_version *)
