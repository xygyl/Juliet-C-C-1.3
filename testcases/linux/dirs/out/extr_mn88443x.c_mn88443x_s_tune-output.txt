UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses `c->stream_id`, but there is no guarantee in the functionâ€™s code that the pointer `c` is valid or non-NULL. This leads to potential undefined behavior due to dereferencing a NULL pointer if `c` is NULL. Additionally, the lack of validation of `chip` could also result in undefined behavior if it is NULL and the `chip->regmap_s` member is accessed.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: This function assumes that both `chip` and `c` are valid, non-NULL pointers, but it does not check for NULL pointers. If either is NULL, a dereference will cause a crash or undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to ensure both `chip` and `c` are non-NULL before using their members or dereferencing them. Example:
```c
if (!chip || !chip->regmap_s || !c) {
    return; // Or handle the error appropriately
}
```
