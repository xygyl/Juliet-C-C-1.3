UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses `vfork()`, which poses undefined behavior risks if the child process modifies any data structures or returns from the function before `execve()` or `_exit()` is called. The child is expected not to execute any code that modifies global state or local variables shared with the parent. In this case, `while (true) sleep(1)` meets these conditions but still relies on undefined behavior nuances of `vfork()` due to the lack of guarantees for using this construct in compliant, portable code.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw leading to undefined behavior  
Bug Reason: The child process created by `vfork()` enters an infinite loop via `while (true) sleep(1);`. This causes the parent process to hang indefinitely because `vfork()` allows the child process to share the stack with the parent until `_exit()` or `execve()` is called, resulting in undefined behavior and a logical failure. Additionally, `vfork()` may be unsafe in this context per its semantics.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Replace the use of `vfork()` with `fork()`, as `fork()` does not share the stack with the parent process, avoiding the undefined behavior associated with `vfork()`. Alternatively, ensure the child process calls `_exit()` immediately after performing any necessary operations rather than entering an infinite loop.  

Corrected code example:  
```c
static int vfork_fn(const char *cgroup, void *arg)
{
	int pid = fork(); // Replaces the use of vfork()

	if (pid == 0) {
		_exit(0); // Ensure immediate exit for child process
	}

	return pid;
}
```  
By ensuring the child process exits or executes a new program immediately, undefined behavior is avoided.
