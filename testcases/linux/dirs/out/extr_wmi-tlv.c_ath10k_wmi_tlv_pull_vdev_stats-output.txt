### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `ARRAY_SIZE` macro is applied to pointers (e.g., `src->num_tx_frames`), which yields the size of the pointer instead of the actual array size since the `wmi_tlv_vdev_stats` structure lacks explicit information about the array sizes. Iterating based on a pointer's size leads to undefined behavior as memory access may go out of bounds.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: Lack of clear boundary checking or array size definitions in the `wmi_tlv_vdev_stats` structure causes potential buffer overflow. Accessing elements of `src->num_tx_frames[i]` and similar arrays in the for-loops is unsafe; this assumes `num_tx_frames` and other arrays are sufficiently large but doesn't verify this assumption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence:
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
- Ensure proper array size definitions for `wmi_tlv_vdev_stats`'s members and validate sizes before iterating in loops.
- Replace `ARRAY_SIZE` with an explicitly defined size constant for each array, e.g., using macros or enums for clarity.
- Add boundary checks inside the for-loops to confirm that `i` doesn't exceed the actual size of the arrays.

Example:
```c
#define NUM_TX_FRAMES_COUNT 8  // Replace with actual array size
for (i = 0; i < NUM_TX_FRAMES_COUNT; i++) {
    dst->num_tx_frames[i] = __le32_to_cpu(src->num_tx_frames[i]);
}
```
