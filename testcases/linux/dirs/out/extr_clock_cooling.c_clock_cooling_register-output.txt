UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code potentially invokes undefined behavior through `snprintf` when calculating the size of the `dev_name` buffer. If `sizeof(dev_name)` incorrectly matches `THERMAL_NAME_LENGTH`, and the formatting overflows this size, this may cause a buffer overflow (undefined behavior in C). Furthermore, there is no clear evidence that the frequency initialization for `ccdev->freq_table` has been fully validated before usage, which may lead to accessing uninitialized memory, triggering undefined behavior depending on `dev_pm_opp_init_cpufreq_table`. Last UB occurrence proves itself(description).--
