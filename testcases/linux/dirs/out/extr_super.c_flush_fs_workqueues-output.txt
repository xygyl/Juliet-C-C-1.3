Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_super.c_flush_fs_workqueues.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function assumes that `fsc` is always a valid non-NULL pointer without checking explicitly. Passing a NULL pointer to `flush_workqueue` would result in undefined behavior due to dereferencing a NULL pointer.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `fsc` is NULL, calling `flush_workqueue(fsc->inode_wq)` or `flush_workqueue(fsc->cap_wq)` would lead to a null pointer dereference, which is a critical runtime error.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (fsc == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
