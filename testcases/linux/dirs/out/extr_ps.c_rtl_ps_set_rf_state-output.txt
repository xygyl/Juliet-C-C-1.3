UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `mdelay()` function is called in a `while (true)` loop without proper exit safeguards, which could lead to excessive recursion or the failure to meet an exit condition if `rfwait_cnt` does not increment properly. Moreover, there is a possible issue in failing exit-pitfalls in line details not to follow recursion automatically down from `parallel`.    

Bug Detected: Yes:/No
Bug Type: memory-leak errors
Bug Reason: memory-leak error_runtime,None Memory.
