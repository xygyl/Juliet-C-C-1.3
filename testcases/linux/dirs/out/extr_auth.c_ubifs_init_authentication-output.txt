### UB Analysis:

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: 
1. **Dereferencing Invalid Pointers:** There is no explicit null pointer check when `crypto_alloc_shash` fails, which could result in undefined behavior if the subsequent dereferences of `c->hash_tfm` or `c->hmac_tfm` are performed. Specifically, if `crypto_alloc_shash` returns a pointer encoded as an error (using `PTR_ERR`), dereferencing it without a proper check results in UB.  
2. **Signed Integer Overflow Risk:** No bounds checks are performed to ensure `crypto_shash_digestsize` does not return negative values, which could lead to signed integer overflow in comparison operations or assignment (e.g., `c->hash_len > UBIFS_HASH_ARR_SZ` or `c->hash_len = crypto_shash_digestsize(c->hash_tfm)`).

### Bug Analysis:

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logical Flaws, Memory-Related Issues  
Bug Reason: 
1. **Memory Leaks on Error Paths:** In the error handling paths (`out_free_hash`, `out_free_hmac`), the function `crypto_free_shash` is called only if an error occurs (`if (err)`), but the allocated resources are not always properly released in the absence of errors for partial allocations. This could lead to a memory leak if certain cleanup paths are followed incompletely.  
2. **Potential Invalid Memory Access:** If `crypto_alloc_shash` fails and `c->hash_tfm` or `c->hmac_tfm` is set to an error pointer (encoded using `PTR_ERR`), subsequent code may incorrectly attempt to use these as valid pointers (e.g., `crypto_shash_digestsize` or `crypto_shash_setkey`).  
3. **Improper Error Handling:** The error checks rely on `IS_ERR` macros and conditional checks after dereferencing pointers, but inconsistencies in handling errors could lead to runtime crashes (e.g., calling `crypto_shash_free` on invalid pointers).

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:

1. **Null Pointer and Error Checks:** Introduce explicit null pointer and error checks before any dereference or usage. For instance:
   ```c
   if (IS_ERR(c->hash_tfm)) {
       return PTR_ERR(c->hash_tfm);
   }
   ```
   Similarly, when checking failure conditions for `c->hmac_tfm`, verify the `crypto_shash_digestsize` does not return negative values that could lead to invalid memory access.

2. **Proper Resource Cleanup:** Ensure consistent cleanup when errors occur. Modify error handling paths to release all allocated resources correctly:
   ```c
   err = crypto_shash_setkey(c->hmac_tfm, ukp->data, ukp->datalen);
   if (err) {
       crypto_free_shash(c->hmac_tfm);
       crypto_free_shash(c->hash_tfm);
       goto out;
   }
   ```

3. **Signed Integer Checks:** Add bounds validation when assigning or comparing values returned by `crypto_shash_digestsize`:
   ```c
   c->hash_len = crypto_shash_digestsize(c->hash_tfm);
   if (c->hash_len <= 0 || c->hash_len > UBIFS_HASH_ARR_SZ) {
       crypto_free_shash(c->hash_tfm);
       return -EINVAL;
   }
   ```

By adding these validations, both UB and logic flaws can be mitigated effectively.
