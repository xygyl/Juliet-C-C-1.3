### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The shifted value in `(0x100 << idx)` can result in undefined behavior if `idx` is too large. Left-shifting beyond the width of an `int` (typically 32 bits) in C is undefined behavior according to the C standard (C99 ยง6.5.7). If `idx` were greater than or equal to `32` on most platforms, `(0x100 << idx)` results in UB. Furthermore, no check is performed to ensure that `idx` falls within a valid range.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The logic assumes that `idx` is within a valid range, but there is no validation to ensure that. If `idx` is out of range, the calculation `(0x1 << idx)` or `(0x100 << idx)` could inadvertently lead to incorrect results, compromising the intended logic. This could lead to unreliable behavior or incorrect outputs.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence
Confidence: High  
The undefined behavior has a direct correlation with the logic flaw, and the analysis is supported by the lack of bounds checking on the `idx` parameter.

### Fix Suggestion
Add validation to ensure `idx` is within a valid range before performing the bit-shift operations. For example:
```c
if (idx < 0 || idx >= sizeof(int) * 8) {
    return -1; // or an appropriate error code
}
```  
This would prevent both undefined behavior and incorrect logic. Alternatively, if `status` is intended as a wider numeric container (e.g., `uint64_t`), shift width validation should still match the container size.
