Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_ec.c_acpi_ec_register_query_methods.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: In the line `sscanf(node_name, "_Q%x", &value)`, `node_name` is not guaranteed to be null-terminated before being passed to `sscanf`. If `acpi_get_name` does not null-terminate the string stored in `node_name`, this could lead to undefined behavior when `sscanf` accesses it. C strings must be null-terminated to be valid inputs for string formatting functions like `sscanf`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: An assumption is made that `acpi_get_name` will populate `buffer.member_1` (i.e., `node_name`) with a null-terminated string. If `acpi_get_name` fails to ensure null-termination, any subsequent operation expecting a valid C string (like `sscanf`) may behave incorrectly or read out-of-bounds memory. While this results in UB, it also constitutes a logic flaw since there is no explicit null-termination enforced for `node_name`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Ensure `node_name` is null-terminated manually by adding a line like this before calling `sscanf`:  
```c
node_name[sizeof(node_name) - 1] = '\0';
```  
This guarantees `node_name` is always null-terminated, regardless of how `acpi_get_name` behaves.
