UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit undefined behavior as per the C standard. Variable accesses are valid, and operations such as bitwise AND and function invocations use valid arguments. Memory and pointer usage appear safe.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The `info` pointer is dereferenced without any validation or null-check. If `info` is `NULL`, attempting to access its members (`info->done`, `info->cur_rsp_stat`) will result in a null pointer dereference and undefined behavior. While UB is possible here, the bug arises primarily from logic oversight.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for `info` at the beginning of the function, e.g.:
```c
if (!info)
    return -EIO;
``` 
This ensures the pointer is valid before dereferencing its members.
