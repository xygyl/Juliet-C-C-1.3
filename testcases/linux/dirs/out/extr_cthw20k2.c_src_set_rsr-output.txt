### 1. Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `blk` parameter is a `void*`, which is cast to `struct src_rsc_ctrl_blk*` without verifying whether the pointer is valid or properly aligned. If `blk` is `NULL` or points to memory that is not aligned for `struct src_rsc_ctrl_blk`, dereferencing it would result in undefined behavior.  

---

### 2. Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not check if `blk` is `NULL` before dereferencing it when assigning to `ctl`. A `NULL` value for `blk` would cause a runtime crash due to dereferencing.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

---

### Confidence:
Confidence: High  

---

### Fix Suggestion:
Add a check for `blk == NULL` at the start of the function, and return an error (non-zero value) if the pointer is invalid.

Corrected code snippet:
```c
static int src_set_rsr(void *blk, unsigned int rsr)
{
    if (blk == NULL) {
        return -1; // Return an error code to handle NULL pointer
    }

    struct src_rsc_ctrl_blk *ctl = blk;
    set_field(&ctl->ctl, SRCCTL_RSR, rsr);
    ctl->dirty.bf.ctl = 1;
    return 0;
}
```
