UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `fg_console` is out-of-bounds for `con2fb_map` or if `idx` computed as `con2fb_map[fg_console]` results in an invalid access, this causes undefined behavior (e.g., reading out-of-bounds memory). Additionally, if `registered_fb[idx]` accesses an array element out-of-bounds, it's further UB. The code does not explicitly verify that `fg_console` and `idx` fall within valid bounds for their respective arrays.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The index `fg_console`, used to access `con2fb_map`, is not explicitly checked to ensure it is within valid bounds for the array. Similarly, the index `idx` derived from `con2fb_map[fg_console]` does not guarantee valid access into the `registered_fb` array. This bug could lead to crashes or corruption depending on invalid memory accesses.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add explicit bounds checks for the array indices to ensure valid memory access. For example:  
```c
if (fg_console < 0 || fg_console >= ARRAY_SIZE(con2fb_map))  
    goto err;  

idx = con2fb_map[fg_console];  

if (idx < 0 || idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(registered_fb) || registered_fb[idx] == NULL)  
    goto err;  
```  
Where `ARRAY_SIZE` is defined as:  
```c
#define ARRAY_SIZE(arr) (sizeof(arr) / sizeof((arr)[0]))  
```  
This ensures both `fg_console` and `idx` are within bounds and avoids UB/bounds-related bugs.
