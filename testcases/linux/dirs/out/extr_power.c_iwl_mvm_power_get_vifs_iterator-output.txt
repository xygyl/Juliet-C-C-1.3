UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The condition `mvmvif->phy_ctxt->id < NUM_PHY_CTX` might cause undefined behavior because `mvmvif->phy_ctxt` is not checked for null before dereferencing. If `mvmvif->phy_ctxt` is `NULL`, dereferencing it (`mvmvif->phy_ctxt->id`) will lead to undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `mvmvif->phy_ctxt` is `NULL`, the dereference in `mvmvif->phy_ctxt->id` will result in a null pointer dereference. This can cause a crash or other runtime failures.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for `mvmvif->phy_ctxt` before accessing `mvmvif->phy_ctxt->id`. Modify the `active` condition as follows:  
```c
bool active = mvmvif->phy_ctxt && mvmvif->phy_ctxt->id < NUM_PHY_CTX;
```

This will ensure `mvmvif->phy_ctxt->id` is not accessed when `mvmvif->phy_ctxt` is `NULL`.
