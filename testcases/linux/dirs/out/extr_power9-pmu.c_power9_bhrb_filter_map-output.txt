### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: This function does not contain any undefined behavior as per the C standard:
- No signed integer overflow or use of uninitialized variables.
- No dereferencing of invalid pointers, as the function operates solely on integers (`u64`). 
- Strict aliasing rules are not violated.
- All pointer-based operations (NULL and `typedef intptr_t`) are defined but unused in this scope.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function uses a signed return value (`-1`) to indicate unsupported configurations, even though the return type is `u64`, an unsigned type. This creates type mismatch and can lead to unexpected behavior when the `-1` value is implicitly converted to `u64`, resulting in `18446744073709551615` (`UINT64_MAX`). This could cause confusion or failure in consumers of the function that expect proper error handling.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Change the return value for unsupported configurations to a specifically documented unsigned constant, e.g., `UINT64_MAX`. Define this constant, or use an appropriate application-specific error value to ensure it is clear and consistent:  
```c
#define POWER9_BHRB_FILTER_UNSUPPORTED ((u64)-1)

static u64 power9_bhrb_filter_map(u64 branch_sample_type)
{
    ...
    if (branch_sample_type & PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_ANY_RETURN)
        return POWER9_BHRB_FILTER_UNSUPPORTED;

    if (branch_sample_type & PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_IND_CALL)
        return POWER9_BHRB_FILTER_UNSUPPORTED;

    if (branch_sample_type & PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_CALL)
        return POWER9_BHRB_FILTER_UNSUPPORTED;

    return POWER9_BHRB_FILTER_UNSUPPORTED;
}
```

Make sure the consumers of the function are updated to correctly handle `POWER9_BHRB_FILTER_UNSUPPORTED`.
