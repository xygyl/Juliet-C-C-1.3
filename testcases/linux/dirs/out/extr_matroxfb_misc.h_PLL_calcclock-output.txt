UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences `minfo->features.pll` without verifying that `minfo` is a non-NULL pointer. If `minfo` is NULL, this leads to undefined behavior due to a null pointer dereference.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If the caller passes a NULL pointer as the `minfo` argument, the dereference of `minfo->features.pll` will trigger a crash or memory access violation.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `minfo` is not NULL. Example:  
```c
if (!minfo) {
    return -1; // or handle the error appropriately
}
```
