### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: In the line `if (sz * 4 / 3 > r)`, the `sz * 4` operation can cause an integer overflow if `sz` is large enough. Multiplying `sz` by 4 could exceed the range of `size_t`, which is undefined behavior according to the C standard when `size_t` wraps around on overflow.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The multiplication `sz * 4` has the potential to exceed the maximum value of `size_t`, which would lead to an incorrect result. Additionally, undefined behavior caused by overflow could propagate incorrect logic, leading to further unintended behavior in the function.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
Add a check for `sz` to ensure that the multiplication with 4 doesn't cause overflow. A possible fix could be:
```c
static inline size_t exp_cap(size_t sz)
{
    if (sz > (SIZE_MAX / 4)) {
        // Handle overflow case (alternative: return SIZE_MAX or an error code).
        return SIZE_MAX;
    }

    size_t r = next_pow_2(sz);

    if (sz * 4 / 3 > r)
        r <<= 1;
    return r;
}
```
This fix avoids undefined behavior and ensures the function operates reliably within the constraints of the `size_t` type.
