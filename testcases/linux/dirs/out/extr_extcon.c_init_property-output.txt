UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing fields of `cable` without validating `edev` and `edev->cables` causes undefined behavior if `edev` is NULL or `edev->cables[index]` points to invalid memory. Additionally, `EXTCON_TYPE_* & type` is a bitwise operation that does not ensure exact equality and may lead to unintended results if `type` contains unrelated bits.
 
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference and Potential Memory Corruption
Bug Reason: The function does not check if `edev` is NULL or if `edev->cables` is valid before accessing its members, leading to potential null pointer dereference. Furthermore, `index` being out of bounds for the `edev->cables` array may lead to memory corruption or illegal memory access.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Validate `edev` and `edev->cables` explicitly at the beginning of the function:
   ```c
   if (!edev || !edev->cables) {
       return;
   }
   ```
2. Verify `index` does not lead to an out-of-bounds access:
   ```c
   if (index < 0 || index >= /* size of cables array */) {
       return;
   }
   ```
3. Consider changing the `EXTCON_TYPE_*` checks to an explicit equality comparison if only exact matches should trigger the `memset()` calls:
   ```c
   if (type == EXTCON_TYPE_USB) {
       memset(cable->usb_propval, 0, sizeof(cable->usb_propval));
   }
   ```
   Similarly for the other type checks.

These fixes will eliminate the undefined behavior and prevent potential bugs related to memory corruption or invalid accesses.
