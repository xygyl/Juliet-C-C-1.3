Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel_dsi_vbt.c_sequence_name.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential buffer over-read due to lack of validation of seq_id against `seq_name` array bounds. If `seq_id` is negative or exceeds the bounds of the `seq_name` array, `seq_name[seq_id]` results in undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw / Memory Access  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `seq_id` will always be a non-negative integer and within the bounds of the `seq_name` array. However, if `seq_id` is outside these bounds, it could lead to accessing invalid memory. This issue can cause a crash or return incorrect data.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add validation to ensure `seq_id >= 0` before checking it against `ARRAY_SIZE(seq_name)`. This avoids potential negative indexing. For example:  
```c
static const char *sequence_name(enum mipi_seq seq_id)
{
	if (seq_id >= 0 && seq_id < ARRAY_SIZE(seq_name) && seq_name[seq_id])
		return seq_name[seq_id];
	else
		return "(unknown)";
}
```
