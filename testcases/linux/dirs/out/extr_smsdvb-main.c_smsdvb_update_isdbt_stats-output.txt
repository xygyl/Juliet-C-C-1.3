Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_smsdvb-main.c_smsdvb_update_isdbt_stats.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing array elements beyond their declared bounds causes undefined behavior. The code does not explicitly verify that the `i + 1` index into arrays like `c->block_error.stat` and `c->post_bit_error.stat` is within their bounds. If the `stat` arrays are smaller than `n_layers + 1`, writing or reading beyond their allocated space results in undefined behavior (buffer overflow).  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The function calculates `i + 1` within a loop based on `n_layers`, but `c->block_error.stat` and similar arrays may not be sufficiently large to accommodate these writes if `i + 1` exceeds the allocated size. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the arrays are smaller than required or their sizes are improperly initialized elsewhere.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit bounds checking before accessing or modifying `c->block_error.stat`, `c->block_count.stat`, `c->post_bit_error.stat`, and `c->post_bit_count.stat` arrays. Ensure that `n_layers + 1` does not exceed the size of these arrays. Alternatively, dynamically allocate or verify the size of these arrays to accommodate `n_layers + 1` elements safely.
