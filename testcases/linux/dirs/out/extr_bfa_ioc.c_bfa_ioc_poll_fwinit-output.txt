Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_bfa_ioc.c_bfa_ioc_poll_fwinit.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior due to signed integer overflow in `ioc->iocpf.poll_time += BFA_IOC_POLL_TOV;`. The type of `iocpf.poll_time` is `u32`, an unsigned 32-bit integer, and although this prevents signed overflows, wrapping around exceeds the intended range of values for `poll_time`. Wrapping behavior for unsigned integers is well-defined but may result in logic errors.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: Logic misstep occurs when `ioc->iocpf.poll_time` reaches a value exceeding `UINT_MAX` during consecutive increments by `BFA_IOC_POLL_TOV`.
