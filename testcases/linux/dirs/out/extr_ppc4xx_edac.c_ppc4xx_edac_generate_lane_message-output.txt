### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. The `snprintf` function's return value `n` could equal or exceed `size`. If `n >= size`, `size -= n` sets `size` to zero or a negative value, leading to an incorrect behavior. When `size` becomes negative, subsequent calls to `snprintf` have undefined behavior because the second argument of `snprintf` (buffer capacity) must be non-negative.  
2. Integer underflow may occur in `size -= n` if `n > size` (condition checked as `n >= size` in the code). Integer underflow leads to UB.  
   
### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer management bug / Integer underflow  
Bug Reason:  
The `size` variable is decremented by `n`, where `n` is `snprintf`'s return value. If `n >= size`, the `size` variable is incorrectly updated (becomes zero or negative). This results in improper buffer handling, potentially leading to buffer over-read or program crash in subsequent logic.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
- Add a proper check to ensure that `n` does not exceed `size` before decrementing or updating variables. Replace `if (n < 0 || n >= size)` with `if (n < 0 || (size == 0 || n >= size))` to prevent integer underflow and buffer over-read. Alternatively, verify `size` is always positive before subsequent `snprintf` calls.
