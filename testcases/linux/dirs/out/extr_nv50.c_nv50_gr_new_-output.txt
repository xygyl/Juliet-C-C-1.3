Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nv50.c_nv50_gr_new_.c

UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function does not contain undefined behavior based on the C standard rules. Signed integer overflow, null pointer dereference, uninitialized variables, out-of-bounds array access, and strict-aliasing violations are absent. Memory allocation using `kzalloc` is tested, and `nvkm_gr_ctor` is expected to follow standard behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory leak
Bug Reason: In case `nvkm_gr_ctor` fails, memory allocated for `gr` using `kzalloc` is not freed, leading to a memory leak. The `kzalloc` is invoked, but there is no `kfree` cleanup in case of error.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Include a cleanup call to `kfree(gr)` after determining that `nvkm_gr_ctor` has returned an error:
```c
int ret = nvkm_gr_ctor(func, device, index, true, &gr->base);
if (ret) {
    kfree(gr);
    return ret;
}
```
