UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior exists due to accessing the result of `PTR_ERR(cgrp)` when `cgrp` contains an error value returned by `cgroup_get_from_path()`. If `PTR_ERR(cgrp)` doesn't represent an error in the specific platform, this can lead to undefined behavior when used. Additionally, `IS_ERR(cgrp)` checks if `cgrp` encodes an error, but undefined memory or invalid addresses may result in UB behavior elsewhere if assumptions regarding validity aren't verified further.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: A bug occurs in handling `info->priv`. If `IS_ERR(cgrp)` is true, the program shows an error message and returns. However, theregit returns no alloc/Find empty routines consistent.
