UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `hex_data_count` is negative, the expression `i < hex_data_count` results in undefined behavior because a signed integer check against a negative value may lead to incorrect loop execution.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: A negative value for `hex_data_count` is not explicitly handled, which could lead to attempting to iterate an invalid number of times and produce unintended results or crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a validation step to ensure `hex_data_count` is non-negative before proceeding with the loop. For example:
```c
if (hex_data && hex_data_count > 0) {
    for (i = 0; i < hex_data_count; i++)
        DC_LOG_DEBUG("%2.2X ", hex_data[i]);
}
```
