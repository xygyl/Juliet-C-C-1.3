Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_arcturus_ppt.c_arcturus_get_pwr_src_index.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing an out-of-bounds index in the `arcturus_pwr_src_map` array is possible if `index` is greater than or equal to `SMU_POWER_SOURCE_COUNT`. While the function checks `if (index >= SMU_POWER_SOURCE_COUNT)` to prevent this, the code does not guarantee that `arcturus_pwr_src_map` is a properly bounds-checked array with at least `SMU_POWER_SOURCE_COUNT` elements. If the array's size is less than `SMU_POWER_SOURCE_COUNT`, accessing `arcturus_pwr_src_map[index]` leads to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw / Potential Out-of-Bounds Access  
Bug Reason: The code assumes that `arcturus_pwr_src_map` has at least `SMU_POWER_SOURCE_COUNT` elements but does not enforce this condition. If the array is shorter, this will trigger an out-of-bounds access. Additionally, the function could use `pr_warn` even before confirming the validity of accessing the array, which leads to incorrect behavior.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Verify that `arcturus_pwr_src_map` has at least `SMU_POWER_SOURCE_COUNT` elements during initialization or add explicit guards to enforce this condition dynamically.  
2. Use defensive programming practices, such as nullability or ensuring proper bounds checks before array access.  

Example Fix:
```c
if (arcturus_pwr_src_map == NULL || index >= SMU_POWER_SOURCE_COUNT) {
    pr_warn("Unsupported SMU power source: %d\n", index);
    return -EINVAL;
}
mapping = arcturus_pwr_src_map[index];
if (!mapping.valid_mapping) {
    pr_warn("Unsupported SMU power source: %d\n", index);
    return -EINVAL;
}
return mapping.map_to;
```
