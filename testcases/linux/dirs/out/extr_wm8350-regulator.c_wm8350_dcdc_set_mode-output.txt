UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The value of `dcdc - WM8350_DCDC_1` could result in an out-of-range shift operation when calculating `val = 1 << (dcdc - WM8350_DCDC_1)`. Shifting a value by an amount greater than or equal to the width of the type (`u16` is typically 16 bits) causes undefined behavior in C.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: If `dcdc` is not in the defined range `[WM8350_DCDC_1, WM8350_DCDC_6]`, the operation `1 << (dcdc - WM8350_DCDC_1)` may perform an invalid shift. Although the range check ensures invalid `dcdc` values are captured, `WM8350_DCDC_2` or `WM8350_DCDC_5` can still trigger errors during the shift calculation when selectively permitted with `return -EINVAL`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate the value of `(dcdc - WM8350_DCDC_1)` before performing the shift operation. For example, ensure it is within `[0, 15]` explicitly: 

```c
if ((dcdc - WM8350_DCDC_1) < 0 || (dcdc - WM8350_DCDC_1) >= sizeof(u16) * 8)
    return -EINVAL;
val = 1 << (dcdc - WM8350_DCDC_1);
```
