UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing a potentially null pointer is undefined behavior in the C standard. The function `ath10k_get_spectral_vdev(ar)` might return NULL, and when this happens, accessing `arvif->vdev_id` (as part of `vdev_id = arvif->vdev_id`) is undefined. There is no null pointer check after `arvif = ath10k_get_spectral_vdev(ar)` before dereferencing `arvif`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: If `ath10k_get_spectral_vdev(ar)` returns NULL, the code directly dereferences `arvif` in `vdev_id = arvif->vdev_id`, which will likely lead to a crash. As NULL is used as the sentinel return value from `ath10k_get_spectral_vdev` to indicate an error, this should be handled properly.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check immediately after `arvif = ath10k_get_spectral_vdev(ar)` before dereferencing the pointer:  
```c
arvif = ath10k_get_spectral_vdev(ar);
if (!arvif)
    return -ENODEV;
vdev_id = arvif->vdev_id;
```
This ensures that the function will return an error code instead of proceeding into undefined behavior if `ath10k_get_spectral_vdev` fails.
