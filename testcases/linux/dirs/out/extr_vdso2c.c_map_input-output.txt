Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vdso2c.c_map_input.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The type conversion from `off_t` (signed) to `size_t` (unsigned) could lead to undefined behavior if the value of `tmp_len` is negative. According to the C standard, signed-to-unsigned conversions where the source value is negative result in a large non-representable positive number, which is undefined in many contexts, especially for size allocations such as `mmap`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related Bug
Bug Reason: If `lseek` returns `-1` (error case), the conversion to `size_t` and subsequent usage of `tmp_len` as a length parameter for `mmap` will result in an invalid memory mapping, potentially a large allocation or `MAP_FAILED`. This can lead to program crashes or unexpected behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Perform an explicit check on `tmp_len` before using it for length conversion or operations. Ensure that `tmp_len` is non-negative after the `lseek` call:

```c
tmp_len = lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_END);
if (tmp_len == (off_t)-1)
    err(1, "lseek");
if (tmp_len < 0)
    err(1, "Invalid file size");
*len = (size_t)tmp_len;
```
