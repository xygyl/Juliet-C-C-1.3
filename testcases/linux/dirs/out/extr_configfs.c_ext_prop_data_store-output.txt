Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_configfs.c_ext_prop_data_store.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `ext_prop->type` is not one of the valid types (`USB_EXT_PROP_UNICODE`, `USB_EXT_PROP_UNICODE_ENV`, `USB_EXT_PROP_UNICODE_LINK`), the arithmetic on `ext_prop->data_len` may lead to undefined behavior if signed arithmetic is used and results in an overflow. C standards specify that signed integer overflow is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Arithmetic Bug  
Bug Reason: The function modifies `ext_prop->data_len` by using bitwise operations (such as `<<= 1`) and increments without verifying whether `len` or the intermediate results would cause `ext_prop->data_len` to exceed its valid range or wrap around. This could lead to corrupted memory calculations for `desc->ext_prop_len`, potentially causing buffer overflows or mismanagement of memory, as these values are used in allocations and other operations elsewhere.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Introduce range checks to ensure `len` does not exceed the maximum value that can represent `ext_prop->data_len`.  
2. Ensure bit shifting and arithmetic operations on signed integers are properly guarded against overflow by using safe types (e.g., using unsigned integers or size_t types for these calculations).  
3. Validate `ext_prop->type` before performing any `desc->ext_prop_len` adjustments to ensure its value is one of the expected enumeration values.
