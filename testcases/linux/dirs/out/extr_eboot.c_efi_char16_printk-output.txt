### UB Analysis

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `efi_early` is dereferenced without checking for null. If `efi_early` is null, dereferencing its `text_output` member leads to undefined behavior according to the C standard. Also, the function relies on `efi_call_proto`, which appears to be macro-expanded but could potentially contain UB in its internal logic depending on the expansion. However, without seeing its full expansion, the major UB danger here is `efi_early->text_output`.  

### Bug Analysis

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: The dereference `efi_early->text_output` assumes that `efi_early` is properly initialized and not null. If the initialization of `efi_early` is missing or inadvertently cleared elsewhere, the function will attempt to dereference a null pointer, causing a crash or undefined behavior. This could result in kernel instability or other problems.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for `efi_early` before dereferencing its members. For example:  
```c
if (!efi_early || !efi_early->text_output) {
    // Handle error case, such as logging or returning early.
    return;
}
efi_call_proto(efi_simple_text_output_protocol, output_string,
               efi_early->text_output, str);
```
