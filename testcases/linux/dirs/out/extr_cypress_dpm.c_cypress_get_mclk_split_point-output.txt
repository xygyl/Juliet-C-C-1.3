UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `memory_info` pointer is expected to be dereferenced to access `memory_info->mem_type`, but there is no check to ensure `memory_info` is not null before dereferencing. Dereferencing a null pointer results in undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If the function is called with a null `memory_info` argument, the dereferencing of `memory_info->mem_type` will result in undefined behavior and could cause a program crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `memory_info` at the beginning of the function, like so:  
```c
static u32 cypress_get_mclk_split_point(struct atom_memory_info *memory_info)  
{  
    if (memory_info == NULL)  
        return 0;  

    if ((memory_info->mem_type == MEM_TYPE_GDDR3) ||  
        (memory_info->mem_type == MEM_TYPE_DDR3))  
        return 30000;  

    return 0;  
}  
```
