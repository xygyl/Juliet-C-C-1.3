### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function performs `memcpy()` with an unbounded `len` parameter (user-controlled via `dentry->d_name.len`). If `len` exceeds 15, the behavior becomes undefined as `fnode->name` clearly expects bounded copying (likely 15 bytes max). This can cause buffer overrun unless `len` is explicitly restricted.
 
### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The direct use of the `len` variable in `memcpy(fnode->name, name, len > 15 ? 15 : len)` could lead to memory corruption if the length is greater than the size of `fnode->name`. Even though the `len > 15 ? 15 : len` logic restricts copying to 15 bytes, it is evident that the allowability of larger input lengths during validation (`hpfs_chk_name`) enables potential exploitation.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

### Confidence:
Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
Ensure strict limitations on the `len` parameter during validation, and verify its bounds rigorously:
```c
if (len > 15) {
    return -EINVAL; // Reject overly long names
}
```
Additionally, confirm that `hpfs_chk_name()` restricts names to appropriate lengths.

Alternatively:
If truncating names is permissible, maintain proper documentation in the HPFS filesystem about truncation behavior at 15 bytes to avoid confusion or misuses downstream in API calls.
