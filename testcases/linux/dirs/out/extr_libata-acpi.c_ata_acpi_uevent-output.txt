UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `snprintf(event_string, 20, "BAY_EVENT=%d", event)` call does not validate the size of the `event_string` against the formatted data length. If the integer `event` produces a string longer than 20 characters (e.g., very large numbers or malicious input), this leads to buffer overflows. Buffer overflows are not directly undefined behavior in C, but may cause undefined results, including crashes, incorrect behavior, or memory corruption.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer overflow
Bug Reason: Buffer overflows could occur if the length of the string representation of `event` exceeds 20 characters. This vulnerability risks memory corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
1. Use a safer way to compute the required buffer size and ensure the buffer is large enough to handle all possible values of `event`.
2. For example:
   ```c
   snprintf(event_string, sizeof(event_string), "BAY_EVENT=%u", event);
   ```
   Additionally, consider using `snprintf` return value to ensure it doesn't exceed the buffer size:
   ```c
   int ret = snprintf(event_string, sizeof(event_string), "BAY_EVENT=%u", event);
   if (ret < 0 || ret >= sizeof(event_string)) {
       // Handle truncation or error
   }
   ```
