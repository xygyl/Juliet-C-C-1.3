Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_spectrum_nve_vxlan.c_mlxsw_sp2_nve_vxlan_init.c

UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not perform any operations that clearly violate the C standard, such as null pointer dereferencing, signed integer overflow, or accessing uninitialized variables. All inputs and operations appear consistent with defined behavior, assuming external functions (`__mlxsw_sp_nve_inc_parsing_depth_get`, `mlxsw_sp2_nve_vxlan_config_set`, etc.) handle their arguments properly.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Resource management issue  
Bug Reason: In the failure path (`goto err_config_set`), the code calls `__mlxsw_sp_nve_inc_parsing_depth_put` with `0` as its second argument, rather than using `config->udp_dport`, which was originally passed to `__mlxsw_sp_nve_inc_parsing_depth_get`. This mismatch might result in incomplete or improper cleanup, leading to potential resource leaks or inconsistencies in parsing depth state.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Replace the line in the `err_config_set` block:  
```c
__mlxsw_sp_nve_inc_parsing_depth_put(mlxsw_sp, 0);
```  
with:  
```c
__mlxsw_sp_nve_inc_parsing_depth_put(mlxsw_sp, config->udp_dport);
```  
This ensures that the correct parsing depth (`config->udp_dport`) is decremented in the cleanup process. Additionally, confirm the cleanup logic in other error paths is fully synchronized with resource acquisition steps.
