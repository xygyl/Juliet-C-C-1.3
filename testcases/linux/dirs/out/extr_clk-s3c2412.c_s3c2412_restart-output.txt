UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The operation `reg_base + CLKSRC` and `reg_base + SWRST` potentially invoke undefined behavior if `reg_base` is uninitialized or null, as pointer arithmetic with a null pointer is undefined.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `reg_base` is null or invalid, the code will dereference an invalid pointer during the calls to `__raw_writel()`. This leads to a null pointer dereference bug.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `reg_base` is initialized and validated before using it for pointer arithmetic or dereferencing. A safeguard such as `if (reg_base == NULL) return -EFAULT;` should be implemented prior to its usage.
