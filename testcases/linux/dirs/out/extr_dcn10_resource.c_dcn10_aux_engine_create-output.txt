Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dcn10_resource.c_dcn10_aux_engine_create.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `aux_engine_regs` array is accessed at `aux_engine_regs[inst]`, but there is no bounds checking for `inst`. If `inst` is greater than or equal to the size of `aux_engine_regs`, this will lead to out-of-bounds memory access, which is undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: Accessing `aux_engine_regs[inst]` without bounds validation risks using invalid memory locations, leading to potential crashes or other unintended behavior at runtime.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `inst` is less than the size of `aux_engine_regs`. For example:
```c
if (inst >= AUX_ENGINE_REGS_SIZE) // Adjust AUX_ENGINE_REGS_SIZE to the actual array size
    return NULL;
```
