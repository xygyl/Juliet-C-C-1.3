UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The array `chnls_mask` is accessed using an index derived from `(pchild->chnl_array[i]).chnl_no`, but there is no boundary check performed to ensure that `chnl_no` is within valid bounds for `chnls_mask`. This can lead to out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior in C.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: The value of `(pchild->chnl_array[i]).chnl_no` is used as an index to access the array `chnls_mask`, but no checks are performed to ensure `chnl_no` is within the valid array bounds. This might corrupt memory or read invalid data, leading to unpredictable results or a program crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before accessing `chnls_mask[(pchild->chnl_array[i]).chnl_no]`, ensure that `(pchild->chnl_array[i]).chnl_no` is within the bounds of the `chnls_mask` array (e.g., add a check `if ((pchild->chnl_array[i]).chnl_no < size_of_chnls_mask)` where `size_of_chnls_mask` is the size of the `chnls_mask` array).
