UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `usleep_range(20000, 25000)` function call may potentially invoke undefined behavior if the range values are invalid or if an implementation-specific issue leads to errors. However, since these values stay within a sensible range, this UB is unlikely to manifest without external factors.  
Bug Detected: No
