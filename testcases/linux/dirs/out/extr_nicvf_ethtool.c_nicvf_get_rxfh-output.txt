UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The multiplication `RSS_HASH_KEY_SIZE * sizeof(u64)` in the `memcpy` operation may lead to undefined behavior if `RSS_HASH_KEY_SIZE` is excessively large, resulting in an integer overflow or an out-of-bounds memory access. Additionally, the `rss_size` and `ind_tbl` values in `rss` are assumed to be valid and within bounds; failure to validate these values could result in an out-of-bounds access. 

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Possible Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: If the `RSS_HASH_KEY_SIZE` exceeds the allocated memory for `rss->key`, the `memcpy` could overwrite undefined memory regions, leading to a buffer overflow. Similarly, iterating up to `rss->rss_size` may cause out-of-bounds access to `rss->ind_tbl` if `rss_size` is not within the valid range of indices for the array.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Validate `RSS_HASH_KEY_SIZE` and the allocated size of `rss->key` before performing the `memcpy` operation to ensure no overflow occurs.
2. Validate `rss->rss_size` before the loop that accesses `rss->ind_tbl` to ensure it does not exceed the allocated size of the array.
3. Introduce bounds checks for all potentially critical values (`RSS_HASH_KEY_SIZE`, `rss_size`, etc.) to prevent undefined behavior and bugs.
