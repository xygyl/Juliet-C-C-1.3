Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fork.c_free_signal_struct.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function checks `if (sig->oom_mm)` but does not verify whether `sig` itself is valid (non-NULL) before dereferencing it (e.g., `sig->oom_mm`). If `sig` is passed as `NULL`, dereferencing it results in undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `sig` is NULL, the function will attempt to dereference it (`sig->oom_mm`), leading to a null pointer dereference. This issue violates memory safety and can result in a segmentation fault during runtime.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL check at the start of the function:
```c
if (!sig)
    return;
```
This ensures the function does nothing if a NULL signal structure is passed.
