**UB Analysis**:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function follows proper type usage and logical flow without operations that lead to undefined behavior as per the C standard. `iminor(inode)` is used safely, and no potentially undefined operations like null pointer access, uninitialized variables, or signed integer overflow occur.

**Bug Analysis**:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The `capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN)` check does not enforce returning an error code immediately. Instead, it sets `retval = -EACCES` but still allows execution of subsequent code. This could cause unintended effects if `minor_number` is evaluated or used beyond the capability failure (though none is present here). Additionally, if future code is added after `goto out`, it might inadvertently execute despite the capability test failingâ€”not maintaining proper logic isolation.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Change `goto out;` to an explicit `return -EACCES;` after the `capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN)` check to ensure proper handling of the access control failure. Alternatively, isolate the `capable` check logic better by terminating early with `return retval;` before further code execution.
