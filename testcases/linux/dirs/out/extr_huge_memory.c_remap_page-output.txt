Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_huge_memory.c_remap_page.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing `page + i` for all `i < HPAGE_PMD_NR` in the else branch may lead to undefined behavior if the pointer to `page` is insufficiently allocated or not properly aligned for pointer arithmetic. Pointer arithmetic beyond allocated memory is undefined per the C standard.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic/Memory-related bug  
Bug Reason: Potential out-of-bounds memory access in the else branch using `page + i` when iterating through `HPAGE_PMD_NR` indices without verifying bounds or ensuring memory safety. This could lead to arbitrary memory reads/writes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Verify the size and alignment of the memory region `page` points to before performing pointer arithmetic. Alternatively, ensure enough contiguous memory is allocated for `page` with size equal to or greater than `HPAGE_PMD_NR` pages.
