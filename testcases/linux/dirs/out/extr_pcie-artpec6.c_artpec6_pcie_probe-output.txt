UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function contains potential undefined behavior in the following scenario: dereferencing a pointer that may be `NULL` after a failed memory mapping or `syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle`. Specifically:
- `devm_ioremap_resource`, when called on `dbi_base` or `phy_base`, may return an erroneous pointer (`IS_ERR` check). If this pointer is subsequently dereferenced (even indirectly), undefined behavior occurs as per the standard. Additionally, `syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle` may return erroneous pointers (`IS_ERR` check), and if dereferenced, undefined behavior arises.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential logic flaw and handling of erroneous pointers.  
Bug Reason: The errors returned by `PTR_ERR(pci->dbi_base)` or `PTR_ERR(artpec6_pcie->phy_base)` and the mistaken use of pointers returned by `syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle` are not always consistently checked before continuing operations with these resources, especially in subsequent indirect usage scenarios. Furthermore, incorrect handling can lead to application crashes or malfunctions.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes. Dereferencing invalid pointers directly translates into crashes or undefined behavior caused by incorrect resource mapping.  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure all pointer return values from `devm_ioremap_resource` and `syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle` are thoroughly checked for validity using `IS_ERR` before performing operations on the respective resources. If the checks fail, immediately terminate the probe function with an error code, as partially initialized resources may lead to subtle bugs later. Example:
```c
if (IS_ERR(pci->dbi_base)) {
    dev_err(dev, "Failed to map dbi_base resource\n");
    return PTR_ERR(pci->dbi_base);
}
if (IS_ERR(artpec6_pcie->phy_base)) {
    dev_err(dev, "Failed to map phy_base resource\n");
    return PTR_ERR(artpec6_pcie->phy_base);
}
if (IS_ERR(artpec6_pcie->regmap)) {
    dev_err(dev, "Failed to lookup regmap\n");
    return PTR_ERR(artpec6_pcie->regmap);
}
```
Ensure all resource pointers are properly validated and not used erroneously before performing subsequent dependent operations.
