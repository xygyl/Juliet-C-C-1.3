UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Misaligned Memory Access**: `cap_header` and `cap_data` structs are directly passed to `capget()` without verifying their alignment requirements. If the platform or kernel expects stricter alignment for these structures (e.g., 4 or 8 bytes aligned), passing them as is could lead to undefined behavior.  
2. **Possible String Buffer Overflow**: The use of `sprintf(pathname, "/dev/cpu/%d/msr", base_cpu)` assumes the `base_cpu` value won't cause a buffer overflow in a fixed 32-byte `pathname`. This can cause undefined behavior for large values of `base_cpu`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer overflow (potential)  
Bug Reason: The string buffer `pathname`, which is only 32 bytes in length, is vulnerable to overflow if `base_cpu` contains a value large enough to generate an expanded string exceeding the buffer capacity. This would corrupt memory leading to unpredictable behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. **Buffer Overflow Fix**: Use `snprintf()` instead of `sprintf()` to safely limit the length of the string written to `pathname`. For `snprintf`, the size of the buffer should explicitly be passed, e.g.:  
   ```c
   snprintf(pathname, sizeof(pathname), "/dev/cpu/%d/msr", base_cpu);
   ```  
2. **Alignment Check**: Ensure that the `cap_header` and `cap_data` structures are correctly aligned before passing them to `capget()` using platform-specific alignment checks (e.g., `alignof` or manual padding). Alternatively, allocate them dynamically to ensure safe memory alignment.
