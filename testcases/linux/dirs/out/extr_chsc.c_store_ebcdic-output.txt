Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_chsc.c_store_ebcdic.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `delim` is non-zero (a valid delimiter), the `dest[len++] = delim;` line attempts to write `delim` to `dest[len]`, but there is no guarantee that the memory at `dest[len]` is allocated or safe to write to, resulting in undefined behavior due to potential out-of-bounds memory access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential buffer overflow
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `dest` has enough space to accommodate the data being copied (`len` bytes), plus potentially one additional byte for `delim`. If the caller does not ensure `dest` is large enough, this can cause a buffer overflow.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure the caller allocates enough memory for `dest`, i.e., at least `len + 1` bytes when `delim` is non-zero. Alternatively, include explicit bounds checks within the function to avoid writing beyond `dest`'s allocated size. For example:

```c
static char *store_ebcdic(char *dest, const char *src, unsigned long len, char delim, unsigned long dest_size)
{
    if (dest_size < len + (delim ? 1 : 0)) {
        // Handle error (e.g., return NULL or assert)
        return NULL;
    }

    memcpy(dest, src, len);
    EBCASC(dest, len);

    if (delim)
        dest[len++] = delim;

    return dest + len;
}
```
