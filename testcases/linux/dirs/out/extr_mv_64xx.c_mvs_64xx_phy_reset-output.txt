UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function does not appear to contain any undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. Memory access occurs via valid function calls, and there is no observable case of accessing uninitialized variables or violating strict aliasing rules. The loop with `do-while` waits until the reset operation completes by polling the PHY control register, which is valid.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The `do-while` loop only checks for `PHY_RST_HARD` but does not account for situations where `hard == MVS_SOFT_RESET`. If `hard` indicates a soft reset, the loop does not properly verify the reset completion. This inconsistency may lead to incorrect behavior if soft reset needs polling as well.

Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Modify the logic in the loop to check for `PHY_RST` when performing a soft reset. For example:
```c
if (hard) {
    do {
        tmp = mvs_read_phy_ctl(mvi, phy_id);
    } while ((hard == MVS_HARD_RESET && tmp & PHY_RST_HARD) || 
             (hard == MVS_SOFT_RESET && tmp & PHY_RST));
}
```
This ensures correct handling of both hard and soft reset scenarios.
