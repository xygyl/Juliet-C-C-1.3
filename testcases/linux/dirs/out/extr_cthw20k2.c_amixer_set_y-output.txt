UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code does not perform a `NULL` check for the `blk` pointer before dereferencing it. If `blk` is `NULL`, accessing `ctl->amoplo` or `ctl->dirty.bf.amoplo` results in undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes `blk` is always a valid pointer. If `blk` is passed as `NULL`, dereferencing it leads to a crash. This can occur if the caller passes an invalid or uninitialized pointer.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure the `blk` pointer is non-NULL before dereferencing it. For example:  
```c
if (!blk) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return an appropriate error code if blk is NULL.
}
```
