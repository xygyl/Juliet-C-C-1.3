### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function assumes that the `selector` value provided is always a valid index into the `pinctrl->groups` array. If `selector` is out of range (i.e., greater or equal to the number of elements in `pinctrl->groups`), this results in an out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The `selector` value is not validated to ensure it falls within the valid range of indices for the `pinctrl->groups` array. Accessing memory out of bounds can lead to logic flaws, crashes, or memory corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:  
Add validation logic to check whether `selector` is within the valid range before accessing `pinctrl->groups`:  
```c
static int nsp_get_group_pins(struct pinctrl_dev *pctrl_dev,
			      unsigned int selector, const unsigned int **pins,
			      unsigned int *num_pins)
{
	struct nsp_pinctrl *pinctrl = pinctrl_dev_get_drvdata(pctrl_dev);

	/* Ensure selector is within valid range */
	if (selector >= <number_of_groups>) {
		return -EINVAL; /* Return an error if selector is invalid */
	}

	*pins = pinctrl->groups[selector].pins;
	*num_pins = pinctrl->groups[selector].num_pins;

	return 0;
}
```
Here, `<number_of_groups>` should contain the actual size of the `pinctrl->groups` array. If the size can be determined dynamically, ensure this validation uses the correct mechanism to calculate it.
