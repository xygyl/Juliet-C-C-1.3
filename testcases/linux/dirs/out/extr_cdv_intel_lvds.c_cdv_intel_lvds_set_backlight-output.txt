UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The computation `(level << BACKLIGHT_DUTY_CYCLE_SHIFT)` may invoke undefined behavior due to a potential shift of a negative number (`level` is an integer, not explicitly bounded or validated beforehand). Additionally, the result of the shift could overflow an `int` type, which is undefined behavior in C for signed integers.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: If `level` contains invalid values (e.g., values greater than expected or negative), the function may set an invalid state for the backlight duty cycle, which could result in unintended hardware behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add validation for the `level` parameter to ensure it is non-negative and within the expected range before performing the shift operation. For example:

```c
if (level < 0 || level > BACKLIGHT_DUTY_CYCLE_MASK) {
    // Handle invalid input, e.g., log an error or set to default safe level
    level = BACKLIGHT_DUTY_CYCLE_MASK;  // or another safe value
}
```

Alternatively, use an unsigned integer type for `level` if it is intended to always represent non-negative values.
