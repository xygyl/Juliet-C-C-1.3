UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: **Possible null pointer dereference.** The function does not check if `port->dev.of_node` is `NULL` before using it in `of_property_read_bool` and `of_property_read_string`. If `np` is `NULL`, dereferencing it would trigger undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: As described above, if `np` is `NULL`, accessing it causes undefined behavior and likely a crash. `np` (`port->dev.of_node`) is obtained without checking its validity in the function.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for `np` (i.e., `if (!np) { return -EINVAL; }`) at the beginning of the function to ensure it is valid before using it in subsequent calls.
