UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Direct assignment of `*dst = *src;` is problematic because `struct tcf_exts` is essentially treated as a raw memory copy. If this structure contains pointers or other non-trivial members such as locks, references, or file handles, assigning directly without proper initialization or cleanup can lead to undefined behavior from invalid pointer dereferences or double frees. The standard does not define behavior for raw memory copying of such complex structures, especially if they contain dynamic elements.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The `dst` and `src` objects may overlap, and blindly copying with `*dst = *src` may corrupt memory or state (e.g., this could invalidate the `dst` structure before `tcf_exts_destroy` is called). Additionally, destruction of the `old` object may not make logical sense if the two objects do not represent orthogonal resources. The function relies on no guarantee about the contents of `dst` and `src`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Implement a proper deep copy mechanism for `struct tcf_exts` that ensures all dynamic or pointer-based elements are safely reallocated or managed during the figure assignment. Direct raw memory copying should be avoided for non-trivial structures. This might involve adding a dedicated copy function `tcf_exts_copy()` that copies individual components safely, instead of relying on `*dst = *src`.
