Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sbc_gxx.c_sbc_gxx_copy_from.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses `to += thislen`, which assumes `to` is a `char*` or some other pointer type suitable for direct arithmetic. However, `to` is declared as a `void*`, and pointer arithmetic on `void*` is undefined behavior in C.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Pointer Arithmetic Bug  
Bug Reason: Dereferencing, modifying, or performing arithmetic on void pointers is technically not allowed in standard C. This could cause incorrect behavior during execution depending on the compiler or architecture.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Change the type of `to` to `unsigned char*` (or other appropriate type based on expected data) to allow pointer arithmetic, e.g., `static void sbc_gxx_copy_from(struct map_info *map, unsigned char *to, unsigned long from, ssize_t len)`.
