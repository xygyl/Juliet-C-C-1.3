Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_compress.c_ZSTD_getSeqStore.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: There is a potential null pointer dereference in `&(ctx->seqStore)` if the passed `ctx` pointer is `NULL`. Dereferencing a null pointer leads to undefined behavior as per the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether the `ctx` pointer is `NULL` before dereferencing it. If `NULL` is passed to `ctx`, the program will likely crash when attempting to dereference it.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a `NULL` check for the `ctx` pointer at the start of the function. For example:
```c
if (ctx == NULL) return NULL; // or handle the error gracefully
```
