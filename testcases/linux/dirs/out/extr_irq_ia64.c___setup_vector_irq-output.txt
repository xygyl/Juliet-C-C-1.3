Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_irq_ia64.c___setup_vector_irq.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential out‐of‐bounds array access in `per_cpu(vector_irq, cpu)[vector]` and unverified array bounds for `irq_cfg[irq]`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw, potential buffer overflow, and memory corruption.
Bug Reason: 
  - The variable `vector` in the loop ranges from 0 to `IA64_NUM_VECTORS - 1` without checking whether `vector_irq` array has this size for the given `cpu`.
  - Similarly, in the second loop, the variable `irq` ranges from 0 to `NR_IRQS - 1`, but the array `irq_cfg` is not verified to have at least `NR_IRQS` elements. Accessing `irq_cfg[irq]` for out‐of-bounds indices could lead to undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
  - Verify that `per_cpu(vector_irq, cpu)` is properly allocated or sized for all values of `vector` up to `IA64_NUM_VECTORS - 1`.
  - Ensure that `irq_cfg` has at least `NR_IRQS` elements before accessing it in the second loop.
  - Add runtime or compile-time assertions for these conditions, or explicitly define the memory layout to prevent out-of-bounds access.
