UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `isalnum()` function is defined to operate on `unsigned char` values or EOF. Passing a negative `char` value (other than EOF), when `char` is signed, could cause undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds access in the locale-specific character classification array used by `isalnum()`. Additionally, `next` increments toward `buf_end` without bounds checking, potentially causing out-of-bounds access depending on the caller context.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, Potential out-of-bounds read  
Bug Reason: If `buf` or `buf_end` are improperly initialized or misaligned, the function could read beyond `buf_end`. Additionally, the loop does not properly terminate when `next == buf_end` resulting in potential invalid memory access.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Ensure that the argument passed to `isalnum()` is cast to `unsigned char` to prevent UB when `char` is signed:  
   ```c
   if (!isalnum((unsigned char)*next++))
   ```  
2. Change the loop condition to properly prevent out-of-bounds reads when `next == buf_end`:  
   ```c
   while (next < buf_end && *next != delim)
   ```  
3. Add sanity checks for `buf` and `buf_end` at the beginning of the function to ensure pointers are valid and `buf_end` >= `buf`.
