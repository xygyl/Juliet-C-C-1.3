Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vxfs_super.c_vxfs_put_super.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing fields of `struct vxfs_sb_info` via `infp` after freeing the memory using `kfree(infp)` would lead to undefined behavior. This is because the pointer `infp` becomes invalid after the `kfree()` call, yet its fields have been accessed previously for cleanup with `iput()` and `brelse()` methods. If the fields themselves contain invalid pointers or freed addresses, use-after-free could occur.  
  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Use-after-free  
Bug Reason: The pointer `infp` is passed to `kfree()` at the end of the function, which frees the memory occupied by the `struct vxfs_sb_info` object, but subsequent misuse could occur if any fields are referenced or operations attempted before all fully validated. If fields like `vsi_fship` or `vsi_ilist` are uninitialized, they may cause dereferencing.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the fields of `infp` are safely handled prior cleanup specifcally tied Either delays-blessux; w
