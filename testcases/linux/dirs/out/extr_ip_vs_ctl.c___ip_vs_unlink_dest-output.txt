UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential violation of strict aliasing rules in accessing svc->ipvs->mixed_address_family_dests, and modification of memory potentially shared across threads without synchronization (if used outside synchronized contexts). Strict aliasing is not necessarily violated unless svc->ipvs is involved in cast-based aliasing. RCU-dereferenced pointers (e.g., `sched`) are safe if they are accessed appropriately, but incorrect usage could result in UB. Unclear whether `list_del_rcu()` handles concurrent updates properly.  
Bug Detected: Medium error case
