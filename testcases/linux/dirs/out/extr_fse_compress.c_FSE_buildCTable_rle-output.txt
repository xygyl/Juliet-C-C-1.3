Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fse_compress.c_FSE_buildCTable_rle.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing elements in memory before the declared starting point of the array (`tableU16[-2]` and `tableU16[-1]`) leads to undefined behavior as per the C standard. Negative indexing of arrays is explicitly disallowed.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related bug
Bug Reason: The negative indexing (`tableU16[-2]` and `tableU16[-1]`) results in potential corruption of adjacent memory, which violates memory safety and can lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior. This is a clear logic flaw, as the code improperly assumes accessibility of memory outside the allocated region.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Avoid negative indexing on arrays and refactor the code to ensure memory safety. Use proper offsets or data structures that explicitly include space for such elements if needed.

Refactored snippet:
```c
size_t FSE_buildCTable_rle(FSE_CTable *ct, BYTE symbolValue) {
    void *ptr = ct;
    U16 *tableU16 = ((U16 *)ptr) + 2;
    void *FSCTptr = (U32 *)ptr + 2;
    FSE_symbolCompressionTransform *symbolTT = (FSE_symbolCompressionTransform *)FSCTptr;

    /* Correctly handle the headers without negative indexing */
    *(U16 *)ptr = (U16)0; // Header location
    *((U16 *)ptr + 1) = (U16)symbolValue;

    /* Build table */
    tableU16[0] = 0;
    tableU16[1] = 0; /* just in case */

    /* Build Symbol Transformation Table */
    symbolTT[symbolValue].deltaNbBits = 0;
    symbolTT[symbolValue].deltaFindState = 0;

    return 0;
}
```
