Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_w83791d.c_show_temp_target.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds array access on `data->temp_target[nr]`. The `index` value stored in the `sensor_attr` structure is not validated and could potentially be outside the bounds of the `temp_target` array. If `nr` is out-of-bounds, accessing `data->temp_target[nr]` is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: The index `nr` might be invalid or unverified, and there is no explicit code ensuring that `nr` falls within the valid range of the `temp_target` array. An invalid index would lead to accessing inappropriate memory, causing runtime errors.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add bounds checking for the `nr` index to ensure it falls within the array's valid range (e.g., `if (nr < 0 || nr >= ARRAY_SIZE(data->temp_target)) return -EINVAL;`). This guarantees safe access to the `temp_target` array. Use a proper macro like `ARRAY_SIZE` to determine the valid size at compile time. Additionally, confirm that `data` is a valid pointer returned by `w83791d_update_device()` before accessing its members.
