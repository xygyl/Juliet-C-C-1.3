UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If the `priv` pointer is `NULL`, dereferencing it (`priv->mu`) results in undefined behavior. The function does not perform a null check on `priv`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function assumes `priv` is non-NULL, but a null pointer passed to the function would cause it to dereference `priv` and lead to a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `priv` is not NULL:
```c
if (priv == NULL)
    return;
```
