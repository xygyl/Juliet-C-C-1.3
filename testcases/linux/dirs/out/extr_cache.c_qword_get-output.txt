Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cache.c_qword_get.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The operations `(h << 4) | l` and `(byte << 3) | ...` can potentially invoke undefined behavior if the shift operation exceeds the width of the type `int`, as shifting too many bits is undefined in C. For example, `h << 4` is undefined if `h` is negative, which may occur if the result of `hex_to_bin` produces a negative value and is improperly used. Additionally, `int byte` could overflow when shifted three times in the octal quoting block since its range is limited to 32 bits on most platforms.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow/Underflow, Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: In both cases (Hex and Octal parsing), the function assumes `bufsize - 1` is large enough to accommodate the data without performing checks for cases where `len + 1` exceeds `bufsize`. This might result in writing past the boundary of the `dest` buffer, causing a buffer overflow. Furthermore, the shifting logic used for constructing bytes (`h << 4 | l` and `byte << n...`) can trigger integer overflow or result in incorrect computation if input assumptions are violated.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Replace unsafe shifts with masks and range checks for values returned by `hex_to_bin` and computed in the octal block. Ensure `buffer size` is validated against `len + 1` rigorously every iteration.
2. Add proper bounds checking to prevent integer overflow or underflow during shift operations.
