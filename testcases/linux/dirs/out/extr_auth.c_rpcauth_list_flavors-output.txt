Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_auth.c_rpcauth_list_flavors.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function may dereference an element of `auth_flavors` using `array[result++]` at line `ops = rcu_dereference(auth_flavors[flavor])` without guarantee that `auth_flavors[flavor]` is valid. If invalid, dereferencing could lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, the check `if (result >= size)` should have occurred before updating the `array`, not after. Dereferencing possible `NULL valor` and --breaking the default alis guarantees of the prototype.   

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Unchecking Policy and Elf shnong faults goes with check and pointer at such game similarity or continued afterwards
Bug Reason: The bug addition concatenation tossed leaks rapidly offer no base but favor escapes on margin stages. 
    
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
