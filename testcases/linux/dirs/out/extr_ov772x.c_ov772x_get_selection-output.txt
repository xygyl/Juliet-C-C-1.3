**UB Analysis**:
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences `priv->win` and `priv->win->rect` (e.g., `priv->win->rect.width`) without checking if `priv->win` is a valid pointer or not. If `priv->win` is `NULL`, this results in undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer.

**Bug Analysis**:
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The code implicitly assumes that `priv->win` is a valid pointer without validating it, which can lead to a null pointer dereference potentially causing a program crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

**Confidence**: High

**Fix Suggestion**:
Add a null-check for `priv->win` before accessing its members. For example:
```c
if (!priv->win)
    return -EINVAL;
```

This ensures the program does not attempt to dereference a null pointer.
