Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_test_ubsan.c_test_ubsan_add_overflow.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The statement `val += 2;` causes signed integer overflow when `val` is at `INT_MAX`. According to the C standard (e.g., ISO C99 ยง6.5 Expressions paragraph 5), signed integer overflow is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: When the overflow occurs, the value stored in `val` will not accurately represent the intended result, causing the program to behave incorrectly. While the program does not immediately crash, subsequent use of `val` could lead to incorrect logic or calculations.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Implement a check before performing the addition to ensure that the operation does not overflow. For example:
```c
if (val <= INT_MAX - 2) {
    val += 2;
} else {
    // Handle overflow condition appropriately
    // e.g., set `val` to a predefined limit or raise an error
}
```
