Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cpuidle-info.c_cpuidle_cpu_output.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function calls `free(tmp)` without ensuring that the value of `tmp` remains valid. It depends on external functions like `cpuidle_state_name`, `cpuidle_state_desc`, etc., returning dynamically allocated memory. If those functions return something other than dynamically allocated memory (or NULL), calling `free` on an invalid pointer can lead to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related bug
Bug Reason: If external functions like `cpuidle_state_name`, `cpuidle_state_desc`, etc., fail to return valid dynamically allocated memory or a NULL value, calling `free` on invalid memory leads to use-after-free or double-free errors depending on the implementation. Additionally, there is potential reliance on external functions for array indexing with `cpuidle_state_name(cpu, idlestate)` that could exceed valid bounds.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Add validation logic to ensure that `tmp` points to dynamically allocated memory (or NULL) before calling `free(tmp)`. If the external functions guarantee dynamically allocated memory on successful calls, document it explicitly. Also, verify the valid range of `idlestates` returned by `cpuidle_state_count(cpu)` to ensure it does not lead to out-of-bounds array access.
