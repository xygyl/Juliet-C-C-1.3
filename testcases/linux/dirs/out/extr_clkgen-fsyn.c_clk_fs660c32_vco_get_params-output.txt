### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function avoids undefined behavior by ensuring all divisions operate under constraints that prevent division by zero, and there are no out-of-bounds accesses or invalid pointer dereferences. The arithmetic and logic operations use safe conditions, and the input/output variables are validated before usage.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The calculation of `ndiv` may result in unintended behavior due to integer truncation during division. Specifically, the formula `n = output * pdiv / input` assumes all values are adjusted correctly when divided and truncated as integers, but the truncation could lead to unexpected results depending on the relationship between `input`, `output`, and `pdiv`. Furthermore, the use of fixed `pdiv = 1` limits functionality, and the function explicitly fails for `input > 40000000` without attempting to handle other potential formulas or configurations.

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  

### Fix Suggestion:
- Ensure the division `n = output * pdiv / input` handles rounding correctly, if fractional results are critical.
- Expand or clarify handling for cases where `input > 40000000` to improve robustness or document the decision explicitly.
- Introduce bounds checking or add further validation before applying values to the formula.
