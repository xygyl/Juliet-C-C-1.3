Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fib_frontend.c_inet_addr_type_dev_table.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The ternary operator's `:` behavior in `u32 rt_table = l3mdev_fib_table(dev) ? : RT_TABLE_LOCAL;` may cause undefined behavior in C. The syntax `x ? : y` is a GCC-specific extension, and while valid in GCC, it is not portable or standard C. It violates strict adherence to the C standard and is therefore undefined behavior outside of GCC-compatible compilers.

Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: N/A
Bug Reason: The function does not seem to contain any logic or memory-related errors. The rest of the code appears to correctly handle its intended logic for determining the `inet_dev_addr_type`. The `l3mdev_fib_table` and `__inet_dev_addr_type` interactions, based on the given context, seem safe.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Rewrite the ternary expression using standard C syntax:
```c
u32 rt_table = l3mdev_fib_table(dev) ? l3mdev_fib_table(dev) : RT_TABLE_LOCAL;
```
This ensures compliance with the C standard and improves portability.
