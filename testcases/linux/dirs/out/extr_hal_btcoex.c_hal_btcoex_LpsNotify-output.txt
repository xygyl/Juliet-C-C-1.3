Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hal_btcoex.c_hal_btcoex_LpsNotify.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential invalid pointer dereference due to the use of `GLBtCoexist`, which is not defined or initialized in the provided code. If this global variable is not properly initialized, passing its address to `EXhalbtcoutsrc_LpsNotify` and dereferencing it inside the function could result in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `GLBtCoexist` is null or uninitialized, dereferencing it in `EXhalbtcoutsrc_LpsNotify` within this function will lead to a null pointer dereference bug.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `GLBtCoexist` is properly initialized before calling this function. Perform a null-check on `GLBtCoexist` before passing its address to `EXhalbtcoutsrc_LpsNotify`. For example:  

```c
if (&GLBtCoexist != NULL) {
    EXhalbtcoutsrc_LpsNotify(&GLBtCoexist, type);
} else {
    // Handle the error (e.g., log or return an error code)
}
```
