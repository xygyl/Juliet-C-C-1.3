Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_stmfts.c_stmfts_report_contact_event.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function accesses elements of the array `event[]` without verifying its size or bounds. If `event` has fewer elements than accessed, this results in out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior as per the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: The array `event[]` is assumed to have at least 8 elements (indexed from `event[0]` to `event[7]`), but the code does not perform any validation of the length of `event`. If `event[]` is smaller than expected, out-of-bounds reads may occur, leading to unpredictable behavior or crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a validation step to ensure that `event[]` has enough elements before accessing specific indices. If the size of the `event[]` array is passed explicitly or can be determined in some way, verify the size is greater than or equal to 8 before proceeding to report contact event details:
```c
if (!event || sizeof_event < 8) {
    // Handle error case, e.g., log an error or return early.
    return;
}
```
