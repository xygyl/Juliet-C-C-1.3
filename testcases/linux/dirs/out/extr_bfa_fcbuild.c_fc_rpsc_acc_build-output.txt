UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses `oper_speed->port_speed_cap` and `oper_speed->port_op_speed` without verifying that the passed pointer `oper_speed` is non-null. If `oper_speed` is null, dereferencing it results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function relies on the `oper_speed` pointer but does not validate that it is non-null before dereferencing it. If a caller passes a null pointer for `oper_speed`, this results in a null pointer dereference causing a runtime error.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null-check for `oper_speed` at the beginning of the function. Example:  
```c
if (oper_speed == NULL) {
    return 0; // Or handle the error appropriately, based on the context.
}
```
