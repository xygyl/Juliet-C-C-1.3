### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: In the function `addrinfo_to_text`, there could be undefined behavior in the following cases:
1. **Potential null pointer dereference**: If the `struct addrinfo *ai` passed as an argument to the function is `NULL`, accessing `ai->ai_addr` and `ai->ai_addrlen` will lead to undefined behavior.
2. **Invalid return value handling for `getnameinfo`**: If `getnameinfo()` fails (returns non-zero), the behavior following `err("getnameinfo: %s", gai_strerror(rc))` is not explicitly defined in the snippet but may terminate the program. If the error-handling path dereferences pointers indirectly or creates side effects without proper validation, undefined behavior might emerge.
3. **Buffer overrun risk in `snprintf`**: Although unlikely, if the concatenated length of `hbuf` and `sbuf` (along with the separator `:`) exceeds the size of `buf`, `snprintf()` will not null-terminate the buffer in certain implementations, leading to potential UB.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw, Potential Buffer Overrun  
Bug Reason: 
1. The function doesn't validate the input `struct addrinfo *ai` for `NULL` before using its members, which can lead to crashes if such a case occurs.
2. The size of `buf` is constrained by `buf_size`, making it susceptible to buffer overruns depending on the contents of `hbuf` and `sbuf`. While the use of `snprintf` protects against overruns, there is no runtime guarantee that `buf_size` is sufficient to hold the resultant string, possibly causing truncation and incomplete results.
3. Error handling using `err()` might not gracefully handle issues caused by `getnameinfo()` failures, depending on the implementation of `err`.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
```c
static void addrinfo_to_text(struct addrinfo *ai, char buf[], const size_t buf_size)
{
    if (!ai || buf_size == 0) {
        /* Ensure the function doesn't proceed with invalid inputs */
        buf[0] = '\0';
        return;
    }

    char hbuf[NI_MAXHOST];
    char sbuf[NI_MAXSERV];
    int rc;

    buf[0] = '\0';

    rc = getnameinfo(ai->ai_addr, ai->ai_addrlen, hbuf, sizeof(hbuf),
                     sbuf, sizeof(sbuf), NI_NUMERICHOST | NI_NUMERICSERV);
    if (rc) {
        snprintf(buf, buf_size, "Error: %s", gai_strerror(rc)); /* Avoid crashing with err() */
        return;
    }

    /* Ensure no truncation and proper formatting */
    snprintf(buf, buf_size, "%s:%s", hbuf, sbuf);
}
```

- Check for `NULL` pointer in `ai` to prevent dereferencing invalid pointers.
- Use error reporting in place of abrupt termination with `err()`.
- Enhance the handling of `buf_size` to reduce risks of truncation or buffer-related issues.
