UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Pointer arithmetic on `void *` is undefined behavior in C. Specifically, `msg_ptr += ALIGN(msg_size, 4)` involves such arithmetic, as performing addition or subtraction directly on a `void *` is not defined by the language standard. Pointer arithmetic requires a complete type (e.g., `char *` or `struct pucan_rx_msg *`), and `void *` lacks a size for proper computation.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The undefined behavior from incorrectly performing pointer arithmetic on `void *` could lead to incorrect address calculations. This would likely result in memory corruption, invalid accesses, or incorrect processing during iteration over the message list.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Change the declaration of `msg_ptr` from `void *` to an appropriate pointer type, such as `char *`, or explicitly cast `msg_ptr` to `char *` before performing the arithmetic. This would ensure pointer arithmetic is well-defined:

```c
char *msg_ptr = (char *)msg_list;
...
msg_ptr += ALIGN(msg_size, 4);
```

Alternatively:

```c
msg_ptr = (void *)((char *)msg_ptr + ALIGN(msg_size, 4));
```
