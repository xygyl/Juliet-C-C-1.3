### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: In the function `gf100_mem_new`, there is a dereference of `mmu->type[type]` without validating if `type` is within bounds of the array `mmu->type`. If `type` is outside the bounds of `mmu->type`, this results in reading beyond the allocated memory (undefined behavior). Additionally, the function relies on the variable `argv` to point to a validly allocated memory structure; if `argv` is NULL or misaligned, dereferencing it results in undefined behavior.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic bug and memory access bug  
Bug Reason:  
1. Potential out-of-bounds array access as described in the UB analysis. If `type` is an invalid index, this can lead to incorrect array access and memory corruption.  
2. The variable `contig` is being used later in the code without initialization in the case where `nvif_unpack` and `nvif_unvers` both return errors. This could lead to uninitialized memory access.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Validate the `type` index to ensure it is within the bounds of the `mmu->type` array before accessing its elements:
   ```c
   if (type < 0 || type >= sizeof(mmu->type) / sizeof(mmu->type[0])) {
       return -ENOSYS;
   }
   ```
2. Ensure `argv` is valid (non-NULL and correctly aligned) before dereferencing.
3. Initialize the variable `contig` to a default value before the conditional flow:
   ```c
   bool contig = false;
   ```
   This eliminates the possibility of using uninitialized memory.
