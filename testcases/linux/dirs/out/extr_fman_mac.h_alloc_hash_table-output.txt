Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fman_mac.h_alloc_hash_table.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code performs a `kmalloc_array(size, sizeof(struct eth_hash_t *), GFP_KERNEL)` allocation but assigns it to a pointer of type `struct eth_hash_t *`. This results in type mismatch because `sizeof(struct eth_hash_t *)` is inconsistent with the expected layout of a full `struct eth_hash_t` structure. Dereferencing or manipulating this incorrectly initialized memory later leads to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory allocation type mismatch  
Bug Reason: The memory allocation for `hash` does not correctly reflect the size of a `struct eth_hash_t` object. Instead, it uses `sizeof(struct eth_hash_t *)`. Furthermore, the size parameter is unrelated to the allocation type, leading to incorrect memory setup. This could lead to potential runtime crashes or corrupted memory.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Change the allocation of `hash` to match the exact type and size of the `struct eth_hash_t`. Use `kmalloc(sizeof(struct eth_hash_t), GFP_KERNEL)` for `hash` instead of `kmalloc_array(size, sizeof(struct eth_hash_t *), GFP_KERNEL)`. Avoid letting the "array size" affect struct allocation logic. This ensures type correctness and prevents undefined behavior:

```c
hash = kmalloc(sizeof(struct eth_hash_t), GFP_KERNEL);
```
