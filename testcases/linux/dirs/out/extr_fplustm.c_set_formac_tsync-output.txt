UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow may occur when computing `-sync_bw` if `sync_bw` is `LONG_MIN`. This would lead to undefined behavior as per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic/Bug
Bug Reason: The computation of `(-sync_bw) >> 5` assumes that `sync_bw` will always be a valid range and won’t result in an overflow or other unintended form. Also `%‘Fix occas≤fin reshbp compl form.`
