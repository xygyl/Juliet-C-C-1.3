UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible undefined behavior due to dereferencing a potentially null pointer (`sample`) without checking its validity. If `sample` is `NULL`, dereferencing it with `*sample` results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: The function relies on `sample` being a valid pointer without explicitly checking whether it's `NULL`. If `sample` were `NULL`, this leads to a critical null pointer dereference, potentially causing a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check at the beginning of the function to ensure `sample` is valid, like the following:  
```c
if (sample == NULL) {
    return -1; // Or an appropriate error code or handling.
}
```
