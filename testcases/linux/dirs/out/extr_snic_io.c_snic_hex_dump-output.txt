### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: This function passes a pointer `data` with length `len` to `print_hex_dump_bytes`. If `data` is `NULL` or `len` is negative, it will invoke undefined behavior due to invalid pointer dereference or improper memory access (e.g., `print_hex_dump_bytes` potentially reads invalid memory locations).  
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to ensure `data != NULL` and `len >= 0` at the start of the function, e.g.,:  
```c
if (!data || len < 0) {
    SNIC_INFO("%s Invalid data or length\n", pfx);
    return;
}
```

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate input parameters (`data` or `len`). If `len` is negative or `data` is `NULL`, unintended behavior may occur when accessing or processing invalid memory regions. This violates robustness principles and likely results in runtime errors such as segmentation faults.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  
The absence of input validation is a clear design flaw, and its potential impact directly stems from undefined behavior when invalid inputs are processed.

### Fix Suggestion:
Ensure that both `data` and `len` are validated before any further processing. Validate inputs with checks as shown above. In cases of invalid inputs, log an error and return early without calling `print_hex_dump_bytes`.
