UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing `radiotap->data + sizeof(__le16)` in `memset()` assumes that `radiotap->data` has been allocated and aligned properly. If `skb_put(size + 2)` does not allocate enough space or align buffers correctly, this operation may result in invalid memory access, causing undefined behavior. Additionally, the strict aliasing rule could be violated in `memcpy()` and `memset()` calls because `radiotap->data` is treated as a pointer to scalar values without confirmation of its type's compatibility.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory corruption
Bug Reason: Potential invalid memory writes due to `skb_put(size + 2)` not guaranteeing alignment and allocation for the `radiotap` structure's full expected size and padding (`radiotap->pad`).
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `skb_put(size + 2)` allocates sufficient memory and alignment for all fields and padding within the `radiotap` structure. Explicitly verify the alignment requirements and consider using utility functions to enforce memory alignment consistently. Also, confirm the type compatibility of `radiotap->data` with the scalar variables involved in `memcpy()` and `memset()`.
