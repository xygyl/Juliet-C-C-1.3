UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential dereference of a `NULL` pointer when `ieee80211_get_channel` fails (returns `NULL`) and subsequent `cfg80211_remain_on_channel_expired` call is made. This constitutes undefined behavior as per the C standard.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `ieee80211_get_channel` returns `NULL`, the function still proceeds to call `cfg80211_remain_on_channel_expired` with `chan` as an argument, which could result in a null pointer dereference. Additionally, the debug message only logs the issue but the subsequent logic does not properly abort or handle this condition.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to prevent further execution if `ieee80211_get_channel` returns `NULL`. For example:  

```c
if (!chan) {
    ath6kl_dbg(ATH6KL_DBG_WMI,
               "cancel_remain_on_chnl: Unknown channel (freq=%u)\n",
               freq);
    return -EINVAL;
}
```

Ensure that all subsequent code relying on `chan` is skipped if it's `NULL`.
