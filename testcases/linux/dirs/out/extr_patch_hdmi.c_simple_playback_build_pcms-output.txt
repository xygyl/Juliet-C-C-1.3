UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function indirectly dereferences a potentially `NULL` pointer in the expression `per_cvt->cvt_nid` without validating whether `per_cvt` is not `NULL`. Since the `get_cvt` function could potentially return `NULL`, dereferencing it without a check leads to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `get_cvt` returns `NULL`, accessing `per_cvt->cvt_nid` will result in a null pointer dereference, causing a runtime crash. This constitutes a logic flaw as the code assumes `per_cvt` is always valid without validation.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to verify `per_cvt` is not `NULL` immediately after it is assigned. For example:
```c
if (!per_cvt)
    return -ENOMEM;
```
This ensures that the function gracefully handles the case where `get_cvt` fails.
