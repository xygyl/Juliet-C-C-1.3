### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: No undefined behavior is discernible in the code. Operations such as integer math, function calls, and use of utility functions (`min`, `floor8`, `iceil8`, `ceil64`) comply with the C standard. Memory accesses via `struct arcfb_par` pointer and `arcfb_lcd_update_horiz` function call appear well-guarded and properly referenced.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The calculation of `right` using `ceil64(left)` is problematic when `distance > 0`. If `ceil64(left)` causes `right` to overshoot beyond the valid bounds of `distance` or valid LCD buffer parameters, it could cause unintended behavior in `arcfb_lcd_update_horiz`. While the function uses `min` to cap `right`, there is no explicit bounds check to ensure that `right < left + w`. This could lead to undesirable display issues during partial LCD updates.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: Medium  

### Fix Suggestion:
Include explicit bounds checks to validate the calculated `right` against the expected window size (`w`) and ensure it does not exceed the maximum possible buffer dimensions. For example:
```c
if (right > left + w - 1) {
    right = left + w - 1;
}
```
