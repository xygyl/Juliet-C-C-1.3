Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cmd.c_mlx4_is_vf_vst_and_prio_qos.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences `priv->mfunc.master.qos_ctl[port]` to access `info`, but `port` is not validated to be within valid bounds for the `qos_ctl` array. If `port` is out of bounds, this leads to undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: As `port` is not checked for validity, it may result in accessing invalid memory or corrupt data when dereferencing `info`. This can cause program crashes or incorrect logic execution.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate whether `port` is within the valid range for the `qos_ctl` array (e.g., `0 <= port < array_size`) before dereferencing `priv->mfunc.master.qos_ctl[port]` to access `info`.
