Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_ima_policy.c_ima_parse_add_rule.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function relies on the result of `strsep(&rule, "\n")` even when the input `rule` could potentially be `NULL`. In such a case, dereferencing `NULL` via `strlen(p)` (where `p = strsep(&rule, "\n")`) constitutes undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `rule` is `NULL`, `strsep(&rule, "\n")` will return `NULL`, leading to a direct dereference via `strlen(p)`, causing a null pointer dereference. Furthermore, downstream logic such as `p += strspn(p, " \t")` assumes that `p` is non-NULL, compounding the issue.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a `NULL` check before dereferencing `p`. For example:
```c
if (!p)
    return -EINVAL;  // Or another error code appropriate for the context
```
