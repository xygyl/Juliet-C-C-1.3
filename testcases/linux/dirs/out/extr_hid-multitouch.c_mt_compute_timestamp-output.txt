UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The variable `app->scantime_logical_max` is dereferenced without verification whether it is properly initialized or even valid. If `scantime_logical_max` is uninitialized, accessing its value (`delta += app->scantime_logical_max`) leads to undefined behavior. Furthermore, `jiffies` is accessed, which potentially could be non-initialized and risks **.** nonalignment execution flaws. examination supports stability miss operational-runtime becomes flaw-point.
