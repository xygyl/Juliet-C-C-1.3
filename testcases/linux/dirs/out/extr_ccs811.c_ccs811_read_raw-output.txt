UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If invalid `chan->type` or `chan->channel2` values are passed, the code can return uninitialized values (`ret` or other variables) in certain default cases.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The code does not verify the validity of `chan->type` or `chan->channel2` rigorously enough, which can cause unexpected behavior with invalid input. Additionally, the function does not initialize `val` and `val2` when returning error values (`-EINVAL`) in some cases of invalid input, potentially leading to the use of uninitialized variables in callers.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add default initializations for `val` and `val2` and ensure all return paths initialize `ret` explicitly before returning. Validate `chan->type` and `chan->channel2` comprehensively before their usage.
