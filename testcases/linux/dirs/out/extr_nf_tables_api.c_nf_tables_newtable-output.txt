Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nf_tables_api.c_nf_tables_newtable.c

UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The code avoids undefined behaviors:
- Pointer allocations and dereferences are properly checked for null conditions (`kzalloc` and `nla_strdup`).
- The `PTR_ERR` macro ensures proper error handling for results from `IS_ERR`.
- Overflow checks are implicit, particularly in `flags` and `table_handle` usage, and there is no direct signed integer overflow present.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory-related bug  
Bug Reason: Potential memory leak if the `rhltable_init` fails after `table->name` is allocated. In such a case, control flows to `err_chain_ht` without freeing `table->name`. Additionally, the system does not track or release allocated memory for `table` and its internally allocated members effectively in case of early termination.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure proper cleanup in the `err_chain_ht` and `err_trans` sections. For example, modify the `err_chain_ht` label to include a `kfree(table->name)` command. Ensure that all resources allocated before an error occurrence are freed correctly in the error paths.

Updated cleanup logic for `err_chain_ht`:
```c
err_chain_ht:
    kfree(table->name);
    /* Continue to err_strdup */
```

Also, ensure that all code paths leading to an error properly free memory allocated via `kzalloc`.
