UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior arises from aligning or exceeding bounds in buffer manipulation when retry logic alters the block offsets (`blk -= ...`). Specifically, `pblk` and `blk` may point to invalid memory or result in arithmetic issues depending on how the retry process reduces their values, particularly since `blk_size` and `len` are involved in pointer arithmetic without guarantees of valid bounds.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Management Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The retry logic (`blk -= ...`) that modifies `blk` and `pblk` can lead to invalid memory access or inconsistent data transfer. If `blk` becomes negative or `pblk` points to an address outside the bounds of the firmware buffer `fw`, this could trigger a crash or undefined behavior depending on the hardware interaction.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Add more robust bounds checks for `blk` and `pblk` in the retry logic to ensure they remain within valid ranges relative to `fw_size` and do not cause invalid memory accesses.
