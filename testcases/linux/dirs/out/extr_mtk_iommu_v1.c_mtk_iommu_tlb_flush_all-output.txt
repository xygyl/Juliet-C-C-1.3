UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function performs pointer arithmetic (`data->base + REG_MMU_INV_SEL`, `data->base + REG_MMU_INVALIDATE`) on `data->base`, which is of type `scalar_t__`. If `data->base` is not initialized or set to a valid memory-mapped address prior to invocation, this could result in undefined behavior due to accessing invalid or null pointers. Additionally, the argument `data` itself is not checked for being NULL, which could lead to null pointer dereference.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: `data` is dereferenced without being validated. If `data` or `data->base` is NULL or points to invalid memory, this would cause a runtime null pointer dereference, crash, or undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for the validity of `data` and `data->base` before performing pointer arithmetic and dereferencing:  
```c
if (!data || !data->base) {
    /* Handle error, log, or return early */
    return;
}
```
