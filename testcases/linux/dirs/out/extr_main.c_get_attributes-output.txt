UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The subtraction `pos - (u16 *)vc->vc_origin` leads to undefined behavior if `pos` or `vc->vc_origin` are invalid pointers, do not point to the same array, or cannot be meaningfully subtracted. Additionally, reading and dereferencing `pos` later without verifying its validity may lead to undefined behavior due to null or invalid pointer dereference.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Invalid Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `pos` (or `vc->vc_origin`) is null or invalid, `screen_pos()` could produce an invalid pointer, which is subsequently dereferenced by `scr_readw(pos)`, leading to a crash or other incorrect behavior. The reliance on these pointers without sufficient validation or bounds checking introduces a logical bug.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Validate the incoming `pos` pointer and ensure it points to a valid memory region before performing arithmetic.
2. Ensure `vc->vc_origin` is non-null and valid.
3. Add bounds checks inside or before calling `screen_pos()` to ensure the resulting pointer is safe to dereference.
4. Refactor the code to avoid pointer subtraction (`pos - (u16 *)vc->vc_origin`) across potentially invalid or unrelated memory regions.
