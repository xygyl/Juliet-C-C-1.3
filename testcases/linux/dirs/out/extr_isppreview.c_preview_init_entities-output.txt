UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Undefined behavior may occur due to potential overflow in calculations for video buffer sizes (e.g., `PAGE_ALIGN(4096 * 4096) * 2 * 3`). If `PAGE_ALIGN` is derived from input parameters, the `4096 * 4096 * 2 * 3` multiplication can exceed the maximum value for a 32-bit `int` on many platforms, leading to undefined behavior when signed integer overflow occurs.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Arithmetic overflow and potential incorrect memory allocation.
Bug Reason: The buffer size calculations (`PAGE_ALIGN(4096 * 4096) * 2 * 3`) do not guard against overflow, which could result in incorrect memory allocation or buffer size setup. On systems with a limited address space, this may trigger issues in runtime operation or allocation failures.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Replace `4096 * 4096 * 2 * 3` with a safer calculation that checks for overflow. Use `size_t` for buffer size calculations to ensure the results fit within allowable ranges for the target architecture. Add a check before multiplication to prevent overflow, such as using helper functions like `__builtin_umull_overflow` (in GCC/Clang) or explicit range checks.

Example fix:
```c
size_t max_frame_size = 4096 * 4096;  // Max width and height multiplied.
size_t safe_width = max_frame_size * 2;  // Ensure no overflow occurs.
if (safe_width / 2 != max_frame_size) /* Overflow occurred */
    return -EINVAL;
size_t safe_size = safe_width * 3;
if (safe_size / 3 != safe_width) /* Overflow occurred */
    return -EINVAL;
prev->video_in.capture_mem = PAGE_ALIGN(safe_size);
prev->video_out.capture_mem = PAGE_ALIGN(safe_size);
```
