Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_amdgpu_pm.c_amdgpu_get_pp_num_states.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `data.states[i]` array is indexed up to `data.nums`, but no bounds check is performed to ensure `data.states` has at least `data.nums` elements. Referencing beyond the allocated size can lead to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access
Bug Reason: If `data.states` does not have `data.nums` valid entries, the loop accessing `data.states[i]` can result in undefined behavior and memory corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the number of elements in `data.states` is equal to or greater than `data.nums`. Add a bounds check or validate the structure's integrity before looping:
```c
if (data.states == NULL || data.nums <= 0 || sizeof(data.states) / sizeof(data.states[0]) < data.nums) {
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
