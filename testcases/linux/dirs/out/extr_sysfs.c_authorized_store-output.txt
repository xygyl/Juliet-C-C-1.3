Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sysfs.c_authorized_store.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `sscanf` call processes `buf` without explicitly ensuring `buf` is null-terminated or correctly sized, leading to potential undefined behavior if `buf` is non-terminating or shorter than expected.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related Bug
Bug Reason: The `sscanf` call can read past the bounds of the `buf` buffer if it does not contain sufficient length for parsing, potentially causing out-of-bounds reads.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `buf` is null-terminated before using `sscanf`. Alternatively, use functions such as `strtoul` for parsing to avoid undefined behavior due to rogue buffer contents.
