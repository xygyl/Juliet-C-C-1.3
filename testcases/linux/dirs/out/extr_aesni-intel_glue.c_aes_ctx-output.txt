### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Casting to `unsigned long` loses pointer type safety**: The code casts `raw_ctx` (a `void*`) to `unsigned long`, then aligns it using `ALIGN`. This can cause undefined behavior on platforms where `sizeof(unsigned long)` is smaller than `sizeof(void*)`. For example, on 64-bit architectures where `unsigned long` is only 32 bits wide, the cast can truncate the pointer value, potentially causing misaligned or invalid pointers.  
2. **Misaligned pointer dereference**: After aligning the address (`ALIGN(addr, align)`), the function casts the adjusted address back to `struct crypto_aes_ctx *`. If the adjusted address does not correspond to validly aligned memory (depending on hardware constraints), dereferencing it later could result in undefined behavior due to violating alignment requirements.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, pointer hazard  
Bug Reason: Misaligned pointer operations could produce unpredictable results or crash the program during dereferencing due to alignment issues or invalid pointers. Casting a `void*` to `unsigned long` disregards architectural differences (e.g., word size). Additionally, the function implicitly assumes that the aligned address is always valid, which may not hold true.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:  
Instead of casting `raw_ctx` to `unsigned long`, use pointer arithmetic directly for alignment, which is safer and portable:  
```c
static inline struct crypto_aes_ctx *aes_ctx(void *raw_ctx)
{
    uintptr_t addr = (uintptr_t)raw_ctx;  // Use uintptr_t for safe pointer-to-integer cast
    uintptr_t align = AESNI_ALIGN;

    if (align <= crypto_tfm_ctx_alignment())
        align = 1;

    return (struct crypto_aes_ctx *)ALIGN(addr, align);
}
```
Additionally, ensure proper alignment during memory allocation for `raw_ctx` to prevent misaligned pointer issues.
