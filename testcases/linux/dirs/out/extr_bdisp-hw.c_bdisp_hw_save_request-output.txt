### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate whether `node[i]` is null before dereferencing it in `*copy_node[i] = *node[i];`. If `node[i]` is null, dereferencing it results in undefined behavior.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `node[i]` happens to be null, dereferencing it with `*node[i]` will crash the program or lead to undefined behavior. The lack of validation to check whether `node[i]` is null introduces a null pointer dereference bug.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `node[i]` before dereferencing it. For example:
```c
if (node[i]) {
    *copy_node[i] = *node[i];
}
```

This ensures the code safely handles the case where `node[i]` is null and avoids undefined behavior.
