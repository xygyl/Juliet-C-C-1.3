UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences `chip->pdata->pwr_sel`, but there is no validation to ensure that `chip` or `chip->pdata` is not a null pointer. Dereferencing a null pointer causes undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: There is no check to ensure that `chip` or `chip->pdata` is non-null before accessing their members. If either of these pointers is null, the program will crash when dereferencing.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer checks for `chip` and `chip->pdata` before any access to their members. For example:  

```c
if (!chip || !chip->pdata) {
    return -EINVAL;  // Or other appropriate error handling
}
```
