UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function adheres to the type safety rules of the C standard. There is no evidence of signed integer overflow, uninitialized variable usage, out-of-bounds array access, null pointer dereferencing, or other undefined behavior triggers. `uint64_t` and `uint32_t` type conversions and manipulations appear valid, and all memory access is guarded by structure alignment.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The use of hardcoded `queue type` and `engine selection` values may cause the function to misbehave for certain inputs. Specifically, the default case of the `switch` statement (`WARN(1, "queue type %d", q->properties.type);`) generates an error instead of properly handling unexpected queue types, which could negatively impact usability. Additionally, while the SDMA queue types disallow static behavior (`use_static = false`), it is unclear whether this logic applies to all SDMA-related queues effectively and robustly.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure exhaustive handling of all possible queue types instead of relying on the `WARN` macro and returning `EINVAL`. For SDMA queues, explicitly document the assumptions about static behavior and perform additional validation or fallback for potential edge cases.
