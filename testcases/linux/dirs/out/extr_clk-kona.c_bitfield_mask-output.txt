UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The expression `(1 << width)` may result in undefined behavior if `width` is greater than or equal to the number of bits in `int` (typically 32 bits). Left-shifting a value beyond the size of the type is undefined according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow/Undefined Behavior Trigger  
Bug Reason: If `width` is passed as a large value (e.g., 32 or higher for a 32-bit integer), `(1 << width)` results in undefined behavior and can produce unintended results, which leads to an incorrect mask computation.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a guard to check the validity of `width` before performing the shift operation. For example:  
```c
if (width >= sizeof(u32) * 8) {
    // Handle error condition or restrict width
    return 0; // or some other sensible default
}
return ((1U << width) - 1) << shift;
```
