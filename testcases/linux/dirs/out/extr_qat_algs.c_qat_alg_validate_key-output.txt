### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `alg` is a null pointer, `*alg = value` leads to undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer. The function does not explicitly check if `alg` is a valid, non-null pointer before dereferencing.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function directly dereferences `alg` without validating if it is a null pointer, which could result in a runtime crash if `alg` is null. Additionally, there is no guarantee that `key_len` matches the expected values outside of the switch cases. If `key_len` is invalid, this should ideally return an error before dereferencing `alg`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that `alg` is not null:
```c
if (!alg) {
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
Also, ensure `key_len` is validated properly if required by the calling context. If `key_len` is an external input, it may need stricter boundary checks outside the switch cases.
