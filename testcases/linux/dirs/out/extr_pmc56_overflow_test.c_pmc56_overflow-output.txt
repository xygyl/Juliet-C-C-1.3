UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: There is potential for undefined behavior due to type mismatch or unaligned access in `mtspr` calls, assuming hardware-specific registers like `SPRN_PMC2`, `SPRN_PMC5`, and `SPRN_PMC6` accept only values within specific standards. Additionally, integer or neutral signed overflow is unchecked.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory misiterations/PMCs undefined; EBB performance boundaries.
Bug Reason: PMC local storage is *probable bugs in PMC readback; PME struct corrupt unlikely by accident!
Bug Management Boundaries UB? Yes>Edit top of ISR (PC local align `EBB_stats struct.Write barriers!!
