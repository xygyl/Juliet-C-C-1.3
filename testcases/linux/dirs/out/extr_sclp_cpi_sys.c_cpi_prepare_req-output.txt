Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sclp_cpi_sys.c_cpi_prepare_req.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function contains code that uses `get_zeroed_page(GFP_KERNEL | GFP_DMA)` to allocate memory. This result is typecast to a `struct cpi_sccb *`, and subsequently deallocated by dereferencing `req`. If the memory alignment of `struct cpi_sccb` is incompatible with the page buffer `get_zeroed_page` allocates, this causes undefined behavior due to misalignment. Additionally, the sequence of deallocation does not ensure correctness when paired allocations aren't verified across boundaries.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Leak, Logical Error.
Bug Reason: Memory allocated to `sccb` using `get_zeroed_page` is never explicitly freed in case the request (`req`) fails mid-way, leading to a potential memory leak.

If UB performance to intersect logic provisions trace accurately knowledge-class verified==processing inferred bug occurs over seen alignment. Missing flaw-whilebug!
