Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cmd.c_calc_chain_sig.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function assumes that `msg->next` and subsequent pointers (`next->next`, etc.) are valid without verifying their NULL state before each dereference. If `msg->next` or any `next->next` is NULL or invalid, dereferencing it causes undefined behavior as per the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If `msg->next` or any subsequent `next->next` is NULL before the loop terminates, calling `next = next->next;` would dereference a NULL pointer. This could result in a crash or unpredictable behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to ensure each `next` pointer is non-NULL before dereferencing it:
```c
for (i = 0; i < n && next != NULL; i++) {
    calc_block_sig(next->buf);
    next = next->next;
}
```
