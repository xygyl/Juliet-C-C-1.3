Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_extents.c_sort_key_next.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing or modifying `iter->data[--iter->used]` might result in undefined behavior if `iter->used` is zero. In such a case, decrementing `used` to negative and accessing the corresponding memory can lead to invalid memory access (out-of-bounds access).
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access
Bug Reason: The code does not ensure that `iter->used` is greater than zero before decrementing it and subsequently accessing the array. If `used` is zero, this will cause out-of-bounds access to `iter->data`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `iter->used` is greater than zero before accessing the array. For example:
```c
if (iter->used > 0) {
    *i = iter->data[--iter->used];
}
```
