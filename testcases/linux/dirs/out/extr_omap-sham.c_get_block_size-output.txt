UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `ctx` is passed as `NULL` (or invalid pointer) to `get_block_size`, dereferencing `ctx->flags` leads to undefined behavior (null pointer dereference). Additionally, the `FLAGS_MODE_MASK` constant must be defined outside the function; undefined values for this constant can potentially lead to UB when performing bitwise operations.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: There is no explicit check to verify whether `ctx` is `NULL` before dereferencing `ctx->flags`. Passing a `NULL` pointer or invalid memory location will lead to a runtime crash or undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check at the beginning of the function to ensure `ctx` is valid. For example:  
```c
if (ctx == NULL) {
    return 0; // or handle the error appropriately
}
```

Also, verify that `FLAGS_MODE_MASK` is properly defined and that its use in conjunction with `ctx->flags` computations results in valid scenarios only.
