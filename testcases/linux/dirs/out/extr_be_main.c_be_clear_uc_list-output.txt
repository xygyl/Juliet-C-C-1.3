Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_be_main.c_be_clear_uc_list.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing out-of-bounds memory in `adapter->pmac_id[i + 1]`. The loop incorrectly references an element past the bounds of the array since `adapter->pmac_id[i + 1]` is accessed without confirming the bounds based on `adapter->uc_macs`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds memory access
Bug Reason: The loop starts iterating from `i = 0`. When `i` reaches the value of `adapter->uc_macs - 1`, it accesses `pmac_id[i + 1]`. This results in out-of-bounds access if `pmac_id` only has `adapter->uc_macs` valid elements.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Modify the loop to access `adapter->pmac_id[i]` instead of `adapter->pmac_id[i + 1]` and ensure the loop correctly iterates through valid indices of the array based on the `uc_macs` count. Example:
```c
for (i = 0; i < adapter->uc_macs; i++)
    be_uc_mac_del(adapter, adapter->pmac_id[i]);
```
