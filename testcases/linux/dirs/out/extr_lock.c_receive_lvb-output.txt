Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_lock.c_receive_lvb.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `receive_extralen(ms)` returns a value greater than `ls->ls_lvblen`, the code modifies the `len` variable without verifying whether `ms->m_extra` contains enough data for the `memcpy()` operation. If `ms->m_extra` points to a smaller memory region than `len`, the `memcpy` call can result in out-of-bounds memory access, constituting undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The potential mismatch between the calculated `len` and the actual size of `ms->m_extra` data can cause buffer overflow during the `memcpy()` operation. The code does not confirm that `len` is less than or equal to the size of `ms->m_extra`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Introduce a check to ensure `len` does not exceed the actual size of `ms->m_extra` before performing the `memcpy()` operation. For example:
```c
size_t m_extra_size = /* determine actual size of ms->m_extra */;
if (len > m_extra_size) {
    len = m_extra_size;
}
memcpy(lkb->lkb_lvbptr, ms->m_extra, len);
```
Add appropriate logic to infer or store the size of `ms->m_extra` during `dlm_message` initialization elsewhere in the code.
