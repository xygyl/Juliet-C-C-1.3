Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_acx.c_wlcore_acx_average_rssi.c  
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit undefined behavior. There are no operations violating the C standard such as dereferencing invalid pointers, accessing out-of-bounds memory, or integer overflow. Memory allocation via `kzalloc` is checked, and the allocated pointer is properly freed using `kfree`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw / Error handling inconsistency  
Bug Reason: If `wl1271_cmd_interrogate()` fails, the error code `ret` is set to `-ENOMEM` instead of keeping the original error code provided by the function. This causes a loss of important error information that could help identify the exact issue in the invocation of `wl1271_cmd_interrogate`.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Instead of overwriting `ret` with `-ENOMEM` on a failed `wl1271_cmd_interrogate` call, retain the original error returned by the function. Update the error handling code as follows:  

```c
if (ret < 0) {
    wl1271_warning("acx roaming statistics failed: %d", ret);
    goto out;
}
```  

This ensures that the actual error code is preserved instead of defaulting to `-ENOMEM`.
