### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The variable `size` (derived from `sector_t capacity`) is being used as an `int` without checking for possible integer overflow or truncation. `size_t` (used for `sector_t`) is typically wider than `int` on many platforms, and this unguarded cast can lead to loss of precision or undefined behavior when the capacity is larger than the maximum value of an `int`. Additionally, the code does not validate that `info_array` has enough elements â€” accessing indices `0`, `1`, and `2` may result in out-of-bounds memory access if `info_array` was not properly allocated to accommodate these indices.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: There is no check to ensure `info_array` has sufficient size before assigning values to indices `0`, `1`, or `2`, leading to potential out-of-bounds writes if the array provided does not meet the expected size. This constitutes a memory-related bug. Furthermore, if `capacity` exceeds `sector_t` (allocated width), the cast to `int size` could corrupt the logic in cases involving large inputs, resulting in incorrect calculations for `info_array`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Ensure `capacity` is properly validated to prevent truncation when assigned to a narrower integer type `size`. For instance:
   ```c
   if (capacity > INT_MAX) {
       return -EINVAL; // Capacity exceeds supported range for calculations.
   }
   size = (int) capacity;
   ```
2. Add a check to confirm that `info_array` points to an array of sufficient size (at least 3 elements) before accessing indices `0`, `1`, and `2`. Example:
   ```c
   if (!info_array || sizeof(info_array) / sizeof(info_array[0]) < 3) {
       return -ENOMEM; // Insufficient array size.
   }
   ```
3. Improve documentation and comments to indicate assumptions about input conditions (e.g., array size of `info_array` and valid `capacity` ranges).

By implementing these fixes, both the undefined behavior and the associated bugs will be mitigated.
