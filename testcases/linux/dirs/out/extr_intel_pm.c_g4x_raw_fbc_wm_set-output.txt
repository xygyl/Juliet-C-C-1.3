Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel_pm.c_g4x_raw_fbc_wm_set.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function accesses `crtc_state->wm.g4x.raw[level]` which involves indexing into an array without checks on `level` against out-of-bounds conditions in the array `wm.g4x.raw`. The safety of this operation depends entirely on the implementation of `intel_wm_num_levels()` and the setup of `wm.g4x.raw`. If `level` exceeds the size of `wm.g4x.raw`, the program exhibits undefined behavior when dereferencing invalid memory.
 
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Access
Bug Reason: The array `wm.g4x.raw` is indexed with the `level` variable, which is incremented in a for loop until `intel_wm_num_levels(dev_priv)` is reached. If `wm.g4x.raw` has fewer elements than `intel_wm_num_levels(dev_priv)`, this results in out-of-bounds memory access, leading to potential crashes or corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium

Fix Suggestion:
Add a check to ensure the `level` variable does not exceed the bounds of the `wm.g4x.raw` array to prevent undefined behavior and bugs:
```c
int raw_size = sizeof(crtc_state->wm.g4x.raw) / sizeof(crtc_state->wm.g4x.raw[0]);
for (; level < intel_wm_num_levels(dev_priv) && level < raw_size; level++) {
    struct g4x_pipe_wm *raw = &crtc_state->wm.g4x.raw[level];
    dirty |= raw->fbc != value;
    raw->fbc = value;
}
```
