Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_bpf-direct.c_install_filter.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The value of `syscall_nr` and `syscall_arg(0)` is not verified or initialized before passing it to BPF instructions. Using uninitialized variables is undefined behavior in C.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Uninitialized Variable Usage  
Bug Reason: The `syscall_nr` and the result of `syscall_arg(0)` are used without validation or initialization, which could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect filtering. This may affect the seccomp configuration, potentially allowing unauthorized system calls or blocking legitimate ones.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `syscall_nr` is correctly set to the system call number to be intercepted, and `syscall_arg(0)` is initialized or validated, so they contain valid values before being passed to the BPF instructions.
