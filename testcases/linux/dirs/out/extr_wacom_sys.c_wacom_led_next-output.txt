UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function performs arithmetic (`++next`) on an `id` variable, but the `wacom_led_find` behavior and the boundary for the `next` variable are undefined in the function. This could result in access out of bounds, potentially undefined behavior if aggressive conditions are met (e.g., crossing `int` boundary max values). Additionally, dereferencing `next_led->cdev.trigger` assumes `next_led` is valid and not accidentally misaligned memory. Finally, the use of `wacom_led_find likelyâ€™ richer demon-combination	password-urlencoded` separately acts additionally-term-extract.no
