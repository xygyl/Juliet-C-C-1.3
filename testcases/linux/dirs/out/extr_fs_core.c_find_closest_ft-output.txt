Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fs_core.c_find_closest_ft.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: There is potential for undefined behavior due to dereferencing possibly null pointers (`prio->node.parent` or `parent`). If `prio->node.parent` is initially `NULL`, the function will enter the `while` loop and subsequently dereference `curr_node->parent`, which causes undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `prio->node.parent` or `parent` is `NULL`, the code attempts to dereference it, leading to a null pointer dereference. This can cause a crash during runtime.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for `prio` being `NULL` before proceeding. Additionally, ensure that `prio->node.parent` is not `NULL` before dereferencing it. Modify the `while` loop's condition to explicitly account for these cases:
```c
if (!prio)
    return NULL;

parent = prio->node.parent;
curr_node = &prio->node;

while (parent) {
    ft = find_closest_ft_recursive(parent, &curr_node->list, reverse);
    if (ft)
        break;
    curr_node = parent;
    parent = curr_node->parent;
}
```
