UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The dereferencing of `ctrl_info` assumes it is not NULL, but there is no explicit check to ensure this is the case. If `ctrl_info` is passed as NULL, dereferencing would result in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not check whether `ctrl_info` is NULL before accessing its members, leading to a potential null pointer dereference.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL check for `ctrl_info` at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (ctrl_info == NULL)
    return;
```
