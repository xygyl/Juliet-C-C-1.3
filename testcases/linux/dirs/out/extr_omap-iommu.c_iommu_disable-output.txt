Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_omap-iommu.c_iommu_disable.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `obj` is passed as `NULL` to the `iommu_disable` function, dereferencing `obj->dev` results in undefined behavior due to accessing a member of a null pointer.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: Dereferencing `obj->dev` without verifying if `obj` is non-NULL could cause a runtime crash if `obj` is `NULL`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the start of the function to ensure `obj` is not `NULL`. For example:
```c
static void iommu_disable(struct omap_iommu *obj)
{
    if (!obj)
        return; // Handle the NULL case gracefully.
    pm_runtime_put_sync(obj->dev);
}
```
