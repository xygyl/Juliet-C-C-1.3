UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not check if the pointer `ii_dev` is NULL before dereferencing it. Dereferencing a NULL pointer is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If the caller passes a NULL `ii_dev` to the function, the dereference operations (`WRITE_ONCE(ii_dev->run_duration_us, ...);`) will cause a segmentation fault, leading to undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to verify that `ii_dev` is not NULL before performing any dereference operations. For example:  
```c
if (ii_dev != NULL && run_duration_us && idle_duration_us) {
    WRITE_ONCE(ii_dev->run_duration_us, run_duration_us);
    WRITE_ONCE(ii_dev->idle_duration_us, idle_duration_us);
}
```
