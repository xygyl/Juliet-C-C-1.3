Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_btf.c_btf__find_by_name.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing `btf->types[i]` can lead to undefined behavior due to potential out-of-bounds array access. The array `btf->types` has indices from `0` to `nr_types - 1`, but the loop accesses `btf->types[i]` with `i` ranging from `1` to `btf->nr_types`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: The code incorrectly accesses `btf->types[i]` starting from index `1` and up to `btf->nr_types`. Since `btf->types` is expected to handle elements at indices `[0, nr_types - 1]`, accessing `btf->types[nr_types]` causes an out-of-bounds access and potential crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Modify the loop condition to stop at `i < btf->nr_types`. You might also consider revisiting the indexing logic if `btf__find_by_name` is intentionally skipping index `0` (e.g., skipping a placeholder type).

Proposed change:
```c
for (i = 1; i < btf->nr_types; i++) {
    const struct btf_type *t = btf->types[i];
    const char *name = btf__name_by_offset(btf, t->name_off);

    if (name && !strcmp(type_name, name))
        return i;
}
```
