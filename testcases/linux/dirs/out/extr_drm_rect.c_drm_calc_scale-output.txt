Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_drm_rect.c_drm_calc_scale.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Division by zero can occur if `dst` is zero. While `dst == 0` returns early in the function, the `src / dst` and `DIV_ROUND_UP(src, dst)` calls later do not have bounds checks to prevent division by zero in those paths. Division by zero is undefined behavior in C. Additionally, shifting a negative value (`dst << 16`) is also undefined behavior in C but guarded implicitly by the `WARN_ON()`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The logic flaw exists because the function assumes that `dst == 0` always prevents division by zero later, but improperly handles cases where `src > (dst << 16)` or implicitly uses the division by zero during calculations.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit checks before performing division to ensure `dst != 0` in all relevant paths. Additionally, replace `scale = src / dst` with safe division logic or return an error code if division by zero is possible:

```c
static int drm_calc_scale(int src, int dst)
{
    int scale = 0;

    if (WARN_ON(src < 0 || dst < 0))
        return -EINVAL;

    if (dst == 0)
        return -EINVAL; // Updated to return an error code

    if (src > (dst << 16)) {
        return DIV_ROUND_UP(src, dst);
    } else {
        scale = src / dst; // dst is non-zero due to early checks
    }

    return scale;
}
```
