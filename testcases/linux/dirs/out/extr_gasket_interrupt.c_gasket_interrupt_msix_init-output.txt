Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_gasket_interrupt.c_gasket_interrupt_msix_init.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: In the loop initializing `interrupt_data->msix_entries`, the expression `interrupt_data->eventfd_ctxs[i] = NULL;` assumes `eventfd_ctxs` has been correctly initialized to contain at least `num_interrupts` entries. If `eventfd_ctxs` is uninitialized or has fewer elements than `num_interrupts`, this operation results in out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: The code does not validate that `eventfd_ctxs` has sufficient elements prior to assigning `NULL`. If `eventfd_ctxs` points to an incorrectly sized array, this will corrupt adjacent memory or crash the program due to illegal access.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to validate that `eventfd_ctxs` is properly allocated for at least `interrupt_data->num_interrupts` elements. Alternatively, initialize the array `eventfd_ctxs` internally within this function, ensuring its size matches `num_interrupts` before assignment.
