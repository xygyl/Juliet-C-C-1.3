Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_integrity.h_integrity_modsig_verify.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not use the `modsig` pointer parameter, which could lead to undefined behavior if the caller passes invalid pointers (e.g., `NULL` or dangling pointers). While the function itself does not dereference the pointer, lack of usage can lead to unintentional misuse or overlooked validation. 
Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: N/A
Bug Reason: No evident bugs are introduced directly in this function as it only returns a fixed value and does not operate on memory, logic, or any concurrency-sensitive code.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Add a validation check for the `modsig` parameter to guard against potential misuse. For example:
```c
if (modsig == NULL) {
    return -EOPNOTSUPP;
}
```
