UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: `p->cap` could potentially be `NULL`, leading to undefined behavior when dereferenced (`p->cap->pd_revision`).
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `p->cap` is `NULL`, dereferencing it will cause a crash at runtime.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for whether `p->cap` is `NULL` before dereferencing it. For example:
```c
if (p->cap == NULL)
    return -EINVAL;  // Or an appropriate error return value.
```

Explanation:
- The function assumes `p->cap` is non-NULL without verifying it, which can lead to undefined behavior if the `cap` member of `typec_port` is not initialized.
- In the Linux kernel, pointer members are often not guaranteed to be initialized unless explicitly handled by the driver or developer.
- Adding a check safeguards against null pointer dereference and ensures robustness.
