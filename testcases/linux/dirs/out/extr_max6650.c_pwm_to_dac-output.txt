Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_max6650.c_pwm_to_dac.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow might occur in the expression `limit * pwm` due to multiplication of `int limit` by `unsigned int pwm` if the value of `limit` and `pwm` are large enough to exceed the range of a signed 32-bit integer. Signed integer overflow leads to undefined behavior in C.  
Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: None  
Bug Reason: Although undefined behavior exists, it does not lead to any obvious logic or memory-related bug in this specific context. The function appears correct in its logic for converting PWM to DAC values.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Explicitly ensure safe multiplication using typecasting to `long long` or another appropriate larger data type to prevent signed integer overflow. For example:  
```c
return limit - (((long long)limit * pwm) / 255);
```
