UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function performs a left shift operation on the value `val` without ensuring that `val` is within the range where shift operations are defined. If `val` is negative or the shift exceeds the width of the type (`uint32_t`, typically 32 bits), this results in undefined behavior according to the C standard. Additionally, `val` belongs to `enum pc_di_src_sel`, and enums in C must represent values correct for their underlying integer type, but it has not been validated whether `val` is within valid bounds.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, Potentially Unintended Bit Masking  
Bug Reason: If the value of `val` exceeds the valid range for the shift or masking operation (based on `A4XX_CP_DRAW_INDX_INDIRECT_0_SOURCE_SELECT__MASK` and `A4XX_CP_DRAW_INDX_INDIRECT_0_SOURCE_SELECT__SHIFT`), it could result in a logic error. For example, incorrect behavior could arise from unintended bit manipulations or invalid values being produced.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit range checks on `val` before performing the shift operation to ensure that it does not exceed the valid range for both the left shift (`uint32_t` bit width) and masking (`A4XX_CP_DRAW_INDX_INDIRECT_0_SOURCE_SELECT__MASK`). Example:
```c
if (val < 0 || val >= (1 << A4XX_CP_DRAW_INDX_INDIRECT_0_SOURCE_SELECT__SHIFT)) {
    // Handle invalid range for val
}
return ((val) << A4XX_CP_DRAW_INDX_INDIRECT_0_SOURCE_SELECT__SHIFT) & A4XX_CP_DRAW_INDX_INDIRECT_0_SOURCE_SELECT__MASK;
```
