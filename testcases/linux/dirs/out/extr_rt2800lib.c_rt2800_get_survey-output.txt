**UB Analysis**:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not appear to contain undefined behavior. All variables used are initialized before being accessed (e.g., `conf->chandef.chan`, `idle`, `busy`, and `busy_ext`), there are no out-of-bounds accesses, and the pointer `hw` is assumed to be valid as it is passed into the function. Additionally, there are no signed integer operations that could overflow and cause undefined behavior.

**Bug Analysis**:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The division `/ 1000` is performed on the `idle`, `busy`, and `busy_ext` variables without accounting for the possible loss of precision due to truncation in integer division. If the variables are measured in units where truncation has accuracy implications (e.g., microseconds), the computed times (e.g., `survey->time`, `survey->time_busy`, `survey->time_ext_busy`) could be inaccurate or misleading.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Instead of using integer division directly, consider switching to floating-point arithmetic if the precision is critical, or introduce rounding to minimize truncation loss:
```c
survey->time = (idle + busy + 500) / 1000;  // For rounding.
survey->time_busy = (busy + 500) / 1000;
survey->time_ext_busy = (busy_ext + 500) / 1000;
```
