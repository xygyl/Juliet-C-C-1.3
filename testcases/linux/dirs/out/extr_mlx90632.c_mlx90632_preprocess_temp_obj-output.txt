UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The expression `(object_new_raw + object_old_raw) / 2` has potential for **signed integer overflow** when the addition of `object_new_raw` and `object_old_raw` exceeds the range of a signed `s16` (`-32768` to `32767`). Arithmetic overflow on signed integers is undefined behavior according to the C standard. Additionally, the use of bit-shifting (`<<`) on signed integers is undefined for negative values. The input values are not validated to ensure this cannot occur.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw and potential incorrect results  
Bug Reason: Signed integer overflow during the calculation of `(object_new_raw + object_old_raw) / 2` would produce unexpected results, rendering the computation incorrect even if undefined behavior did not crash the program.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: To prevent signed integer overflow, cast `object_new_raw` and `object_old_raw` to `s64` before performing addition and division operations. For example:
```c
s64 averaged_raw = ((s64)object_new_raw + (s64)object_old_raw) / 2;
```
Also, ensure input validation for all variables to verify they are within safe ranges.
