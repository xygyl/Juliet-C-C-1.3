Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sock.c_sk_enter_memory_pressure.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There's a potential dereference of the `sk->sk_prot` pointer that could lead to undefined behavior if `sk` is passed as `NULL` or if `sk->sk_prot` is `NULL`. Dereferencing `NULL` pointers is undefined behavior per the C standard.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If either `sk` or `sk->sk_prot` is `NULL`, attempting to access `sk->sk_prot->enter_memory_pressure` will result in a null pointer dereference, causing a runtime error. There is no check for these potential `NULL` pointers.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add checks for `sk` and `sk->sk_prot` pointers before accessing `sk->sk_prot->enter_memory_pressure`, like so:  

```c
static void sk_enter_memory_pressure(struct sock *sk)
{
    if (!sk || !sk->sk_prot || !sk->sk_prot->enter_memory_pressure)
        return;

    sk->sk_prot->enter_memory_pressure(sk);
}
```
