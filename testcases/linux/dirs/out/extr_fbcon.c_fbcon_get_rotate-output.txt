Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fbcon.c_fbcon_get_rotate.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `info` is passed as `NULL`, dereferencing `info->fbcon_par` would lead to undefined behavior. This is an invalid memory access as per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If `info` is `NULL`, the function does not properly check or handle this case before dereferencing. This can cause a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `info` is not `NULL`. For example:
```c
if (!info)
    return 0;
```
