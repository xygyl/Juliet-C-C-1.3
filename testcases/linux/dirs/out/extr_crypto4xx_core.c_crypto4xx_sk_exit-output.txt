Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_crypto4xx_core.c_crypto4xx_sk_exit.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not perform a NULL pointer check for `sk` before calling `crypto_skcipher_ctx(sk)` to retrieve `ctx`. If `sk` is NULL, this would result in undefined behavior due to accessing invalid memory.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `sk` is always non-NULL, which may not be enforced externally. If `sk` is NULL, dereferencing it would lead to a crash or unpredictable behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL pointer check for `sk` at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!sk)
    return;
```
This would prevent further execution of the function if `sk` is NULL.
