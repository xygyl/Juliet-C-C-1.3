### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing `len` without validation. If `len` is passed as `NULL`, dereferencing it in `*len % cred_sz` or `*len < cred_sz` results in undefined behavior. Accessing a null pointer is undefined per the C standard.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: Assuming that the pointer `len` is always valid without a prior check may lead to runtime errors if a `NULL` pointer is passed to the function. This results in a null pointer dereference bug.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Additional Notes
No other logic or memory-related bugs were found in the function. However, the undefined behavior caused by dereferencing an invalid `len` pointer can indirectly lead to program crashes or further downstream errors.

Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
Add a null pointer check for `len` at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!len)
    return -1; // or handle error appropriately
```  
This ensures `len` is valid before dereferencing.
