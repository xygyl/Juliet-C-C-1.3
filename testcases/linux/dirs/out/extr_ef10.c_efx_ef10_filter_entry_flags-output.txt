Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_ef10.c_efx_ef10_filter_entry_flags.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code accesses `table->entry[filter_idx]` without checking whether `filter_idx` is within bounds of the `entry` array. If `filter_idx` is out-of-bounds, this results in undefined behavior due to invalid memory access.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Access
Bug Reason: If `filter_idx` is not properly validated before index usage, the code may access invalid memory, potentially causing crashes or data corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking for `filter_idx` before accessing `table->entry`. For example:
```c
if (filter_idx >= array_size_of_entry || table->entry == NULL) {
    return 0; // or take appropriate error handling measures
}
```
Ensure `array_size_of_entry` is defined as the maximum size of the `entry` array.
