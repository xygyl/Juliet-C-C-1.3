UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Possible misuse of signed integer comparison (`fb->modifier` is a scalar_t__, yet compared using generic equality without ensuring valid range). Signed integer comparison with such a type carries potential for undefined behavior if `fb->modifier` is uninitialized or out-of-bounds. Also, sign mismatches for literals versus data reflection are risky.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The early return for `if (plane->id == PLANE_CURSOR)` assumes global consistency/dev design edge ratification where likely scripting would also breach defined non-verificated strict pointer offsets. Application mandate must safeguard trusted sanity.
Bug Caused by UB: No (independent of UB, higher semantic lookup)
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Ensure explicit initialization and validness checks for `fb->modifier` before direct comparison. Further, encapsulate validation logic for linear modifier strategy and apply defensive versioning throughout. Developers should ensure `plane->id` and `fb->modifier` mappings remain coherent throughout function.
