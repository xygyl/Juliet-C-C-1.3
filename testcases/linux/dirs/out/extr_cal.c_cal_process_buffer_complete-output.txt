**UB Analysis**
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing potentially null pointer `ctx->cur_frm` or `ctx->next_frm` without proper checks. If either of these pointers is `NULL`, dereferencing them causes undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

**Bug Analysis**
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not check whether `ctx->cur_frm` or `ctx->next_frm` are `NULL` before dereferencing them. If these pointers are null, this leads to a runtime crash. Additionally, if memory is corrupt or uninitialized, there could also be an access of invalid memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

**Confidence**: High  

**Fix Suggestion**:  
Add null pointer checks before dereferencing:
```c
if (!ctx->cur_frm || !ctx->next_frm) {
    return; // Handle error appropriately
}
```  
This ensures the pointers are valid before use and avoids undefined behavior.
