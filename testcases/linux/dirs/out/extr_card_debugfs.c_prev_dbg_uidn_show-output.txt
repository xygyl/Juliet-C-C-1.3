Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_card_debugfs.c_prev_dbg_uidn_show.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function `prev_dbg_uidn_show` performs array access on `cd->ffdc` using the `uid` parameter, which is not validated. If `uid` is negative or exceeds the bounds of the `ffdc` array, this leads to undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: The array `cd->ffdc` is accessed at index `uid` without any bounds checking. If `uid` is an invalid index, this could lead to memory corruption or invalid memory access.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add validation for the `uid` parameter to ensure it is within valid bounds, such as `0 <= uid < MAX_FFDC_ENTRIES` (where `MAX_FFDC_ENTRIES` is the size of the `ffdc` array). If such bounds are unclear, additional context is needed, but a safe default is to ensure `uid` is always positive and within a predetermined limit.

Code Example Fix:
```c
static int prev_dbg_uidn_show(struct seq_file *s, void *unused, int uid)
{
    struct genwqe_dev *cd = s->private;

    // Ensure uid is within valid bounds before accessing ffdc array
    if (uid < 0 || uid >= MAX_FFDC_ENTRIES) {
        return -EINVAL; // Return an error if uid is out of range
    }

    dbg_uidn_show(s, cd->ffdc[uid].regs,  cd->ffdc[uid].entries);
    return 0;
}
```
