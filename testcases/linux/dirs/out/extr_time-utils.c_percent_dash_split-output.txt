### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Dereferencing NULL Pointer**: `split_start_end()` could potentially fail (indicated by a nonzero return value). Furthermore, if it does fail or `start_str` is set to NULL (indicated by `if (ret || !start_str)`), there is a potential dereference issue later when calling `parse_percent()` on `start_str`.
2. **Memory Management Issue**: If `split_start_end()` successfully allocates `start_str` but `parse_percent()` fails, the allocated memory is freed using `free(start_str)` without ensuring that subsequent logical branches also catch or propagate these errors. This might result in premature freeing or double freeing depending on the usage later in the caller's context.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error, Potential Memory Management Issue  
Bug Reason:  
1. The logic of proceeding with `parse_percent()` on potentially NULL data is flawed, as `split_start_end()` does not guarantee that `start_str` or `end_str` are valid strings in all error scenarios.
2. `free(start_str)` is performed after potentially failing operations on `start_str` (parse_percent and set_percent_time). This lacks robust error cleanup handling and could leak memory or corrupt data.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Ensure that the returned values from `split_start_end()` and `parse_percent()` are thoroughly validated, and there is no implicit assumption that `start_str` or `end_str` are non-NULL or valid strings.
2. Move `free(start_str)` to a dedicated cleanup section after all operations are performed successfully. Alternatively, use `goto` statements for early exit and centralized cleanup.
3. Adjust the `split_start_end()` function or review its implementation to ensure it allocates and handles memory safely when encountering errors.

Potential fix example:
```c
static int percent_dash_split(char *str, struct perf_time_interval *ptime,
			      u64 start, u64 end)
{
	char *start_str = NULL, *end_str = NULL;
	double start_pcnt, end_pcnt;
	int ret;

	/*
	 * Example: 0%-10%
	 */
	ret = split_start_end(&start_str, &end_str, str, '-');
	if (ret || !start_str || !end_str) {
		goto cleanup;  // Error handling for failure scenarios
	}

	if (parse_percent(&start_pcnt, start_str) != 0 ||
	    parse_percent(&end_pcnt, end_str) != 0) {
		ret = -1;
		goto cleanup;
	}

	ret = set_percent_time(ptime, start_pcnt, end_pcnt, start, end);

cleanup:
	if (start_str)
		free(start_str);
	return ret;
}
```
This avoids potential NULL dereferences, ensures safe cleanup after errors, and prevents memory leaks or double frees.
