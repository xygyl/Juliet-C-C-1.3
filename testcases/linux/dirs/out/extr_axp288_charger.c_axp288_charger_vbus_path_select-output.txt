UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences the `info` pointer without verifying that it is non-NULL. If `info` is NULL, this results in undefined behavior per the C standard due to null pointer dereference.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: If `info` is NULL, the first dereference (`info->regmap`) would cause a segmentation fault, leading to a crash. Furthermore, `info->pdev` is dereferenced in the error path without verification if `info->pdev` is NULL, potentially causing issues as well.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `info` is not NULL at the beginning of the function. Example:  
```c
if (!info) {
    return -EINVAL;  // or another appropriate error code
}
```
Additionally, validate `info->pdev` before dereferencing it in the error handling code.
