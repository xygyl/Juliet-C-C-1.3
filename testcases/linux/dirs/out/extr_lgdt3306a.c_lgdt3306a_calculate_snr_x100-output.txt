UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow potentially occurs in the expression `pwr * 10000` and potentially in the subtraction `log10_x1000((pwr * 10000) / mse) - 3000` if `log10_x1000` involves integer math exceeding the signed 32-bit integer range. The result of `log10_x1000` could also be undefined if the input exceeds its valid range.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: The multiplication `pwr * 10000` can exceed the capacity of a 32-bit signed integer (`u32` typedef), causing an overflow. Similarly, the calculation in `snr_x100` assumes safe ranges but lacks safeguards for large values of `pwr` or very small values of `mse`, leading to potential unintended results.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use a larger integer type such as `uint64_t` or ensure `pwr` and `mse` are within safe ranges before performing calculations. Additionally, validate inputs to `log10_x1000` to prevent undefined behavior due to out-of-range inputs.
