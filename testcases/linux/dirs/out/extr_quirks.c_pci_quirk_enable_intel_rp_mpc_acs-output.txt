Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_quirks.c_pci_quirk_enable_intel_rp_mpc_acs.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The call to `pci_write_config_word` passes a 32-bit integer (`mpc` of type `u32`) instead of the expected 16-bit integer. This causes implicit truncation of the high-order bits, which is undefined behavior per the strict aliasing and memory access rules of C.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: Passing a 32-bit value where a 16-bit value is expected causes incorrect behavior by truncating the value, potentially leading to writing an incorrect register value or corrupting other system states.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Change the call to properly cast the 32-bit `mpc` value to a 16-bit integer before passing it to `pci_write_config_word`. This can be done using:  
```c
pci_write_config_word(dev, INTEL_MPC_REG, (u16)mpc);
```  
Moreover, ensure the upper 16 bits of `mpc` are not relevant to the operation.
