UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `rawir.duration` may be calculated using the potentially negative value `(buffer[cnt] & 0x7f) - 1) * rc_dev->rx_resolution` when `rawir.pulse` is false. If the result of this operation is negative and used in a context where unsigned behavior is expected (e.g., due to `duration` being passed elsewhere and interpreted as unsigned), undefined behavior could occur. While no strict aliasing or memory violations appear here, anomalous signed arithmetic may lead to UB depending on subsequent usage.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Underflow / Logic Error  
Bug Reason: When `rawir.pulse` is false, the subtraction operation `(buffer[cnt] & 0x7f) - 1` can result in an integer underflow if `buffer[cnt] & 0x7f` equals `0`. This value might lead to incorrect calculations or possibly undefined behavior depending on how `rawir.duration` is used further.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
```c
if (buffer[cnt] & 0x7f) {
    rawir.pulse = (buffer[cnt] & 0x80) == 0;
    int duration_temp = (buffer[cnt] & 0x7f) + (rawir.pulse ? 0 : -1);
    if (duration_temp < 0) {
        // Handle the negative duration scenario appropriately
        duration_temp = 0;  // or set to a defined value
    }
    rawir.duration = duration_temp * rc_dev->rx_resolution;
    ir_raw_event_store_with_filter(rc_dev, &rawir);
}
```
This ensures that underflow from the subtraction operation is avoided and prevents potential UB or incorrect behavior.
