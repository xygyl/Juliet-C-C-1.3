UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function relies on the uninitialized static variable `pre_time`. The variable is used in a comparison (`jiffies_to_msecs(cur_time - pre_time)`) before it is initialized, resulting in undefined behavior since reading uninitialized memory is UB according to the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The logic depends on `pre_time` for time interval checking, but since it starts as uninitialized, the behavior could lead to unpredictable results on the first call to the function. For example, if `pre_time` contains a garbage value that happens to allow the condition `jiffies_to_msecs(cur_time - pre_time) <= 8000` to evaluate true erroneously, the function may prematurely return without executing necessary operations.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Initialize the static variable `pre_time` to a definitive value, such as 0, or set it to the value of `jiffies` during the first call to the function. Example:
```c
static unsigned long pre_time = 0;
if (pre_time == 0) {
    pre_time = jiffies;
}
```
Alternatively, an initialization flag could be used to track whether `pre_time` has been assigned.
