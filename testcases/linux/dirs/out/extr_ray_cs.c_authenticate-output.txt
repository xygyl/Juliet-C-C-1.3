UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `build_auth_frame` function is called without verifying its return value explicitly. The call uses the return value as a condition; however, if `build_auth_frame` encounters undefined behavior internally, such as null pointer dereference or misaligned access, it propagates here. But without knowing its implementation, there exists undefined behavior propagation logic rarely ALIVE BAD FLUID LOGIC.
