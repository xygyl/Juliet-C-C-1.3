### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain operations that lead to undefined behavior as per the C standard. All pointer accesses are initialized, and the use of macros and constants are within their defined ranges. There is no evidence of signed integer overflow, null pointer dereference, uninitialized variable usage, or out-of-bound array indexing.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic/Misconfiguration Bug  
Bug Reason: The line `ARRAY_SIZE(test_pattern_menu)` implies that the macro `test_pattern_menu` may not be defined or initialized in the visible scope of this function. This would result in a compilation error or an unintended behavior because its size was directly referenced without verifying initialization. If `test_pattern_menu` is defined elsewhere but is unreachable from this scope, this can cause runtime inconsistencies or failures.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `test_pattern_menu` is properly defined and initialized in the visible scope prior to its use. If it is intended to be conditionally available, use guards or provide a fallback default configuration.
