UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The pointer arguments `ib_speed` and `ib_width` are dereferenced without any validation. If either of them is NULL, dereferencing will cause undefined behavior (null pointer dereference).
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether the input pointers `ib_speed` and `ib_width` are non-NULL before attempting to dereference them, leading to a potential null pointer dereference if the calling code passes NULL.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit checks for the input pointers `ib_speed` and `ib_width` at the beginning of the function. For example:
```c
if (!ib_speed || !ib_width) {
    return; // Or handle the error appropriately for your context.
}
```
