UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `IS_BROADWELL(dev_priv)` or `IS_HASWELL(dev_priv)` evaluates to false, the function assigns `NULL` to a `return` value and sets `n_entries` to `0`, but it is unclear whether the caller of the function properly handles the possibility that the returned pointer is `NULL`. Dereferencing this `NULL` pointer outside the function will cause undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function does not adequately handle cases where `dev_priv` is neither `IS_BROADWELL` nor `IS_HASWELL`. It sets `n_entries` to `0` but does not signal an error or provide alternative handling for platforms that do not match either condition. This could lead to logical errors or potential crashes in code calling this function if `NULL` is dereferenced.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure the caller checks the return value for `NULL` before dereferencing it. Alternatively, consider returning a valid alternative pointer or adding error handling logic inside the function itself, such as using assertions or debug messages to indicate unsupported platforms. Alternatively, add sanity check comments stating the caller responsibility to handle `NULL` cases, or embed functionality provisionally.
