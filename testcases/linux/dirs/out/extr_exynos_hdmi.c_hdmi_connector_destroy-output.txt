Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_exynos_hdmi.c_hdmi_connector_destroy.c

**UB Analysis:**
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: There is no indication of undefined behavior in this function. The function assumes that the `connector` pointer passed to it is valid and initialized. Both `drm_connector_unregister` and `drm_connector_cleanup` are used correctly under this assumption in sequence.

**Bug Analysis:**
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not check if the `connector` argument is `NULL` before dereferencing it in the `drm_connector_unregister` and `drm_connector_cleanup` calls. If the caller passes a `NULL` pointer to this function, it will lead to a null pointer dereference.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a `NULL` check for the `connector` pointer at the beginning of the function to ensure that no operations are performed on a null pointer. For example:

```c
static void hdmi_connector_destroy(struct drm_connector *connector)
{
    if (!connector)
        return;

    drm_connector_unregister(connector);
    drm_connector_cleanup(connector);
}
```
