UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences a passed `_arg` pointer (`struct insert_entries *arg = _arg`) without any validation. If `_arg` is `NULL` (a possibility since it is externally provided and unvalidated), dereferencing results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `_arg` is `NULL`, the code will dereference it when accessing its `vm`, `vma`, `level`, or `flags` members. This leads to a runtime crash and potential security concerns. No validation is present to ensure `_arg` is non-NULL.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `_arg` is not `NULL`. If `_arg` is invalid, return an error or handle gracefully:  
```c
if (!_arg) {
    return -EINVAL; // or another appropriate error code
}
```
