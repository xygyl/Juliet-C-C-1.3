UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `tile` parameter is used in a bitwise shift operation (`tile << 10`) without any validation. If `tile` holds a value outside of the range where shifting by 10 bits is valid (e.g., a sufficiently large value could exceed the width of `u32`), this expression can lead to undefined behavior due to a shift that exceeds the width of the integer type.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: Unvalidated input (`tile`) results in undefined behavior when shifted beyond the integer bit width, potentially corrupting the resulting calculation and causing incorrect behavior in subsequent calculations or hardware interactions.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate the `tile` parameter to ensure that it doesn't contain a value that, when shifted left by 10 bits, exceeds the size of the `u32` type. For example, use a mask to constrain the size: `val = SCALER_SRC_CFG_SET_COLOR_FORMAT(src_fmt) | ((tile & 0x3FF) << 10);`
