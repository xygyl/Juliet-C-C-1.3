UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `(pipe_id * adev->gfx.mec.num_queue_per_pipe + queue_id) & 31` calculation may trigger undefined behavior if `pipe_id`, `queue_id`, or `adev->gfx.mec.num_queue_per_pipe` are large enough to cause integer overflow on a 32-bit system, as signed integer overflow is undefined in C.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason: If large `pipe_id` or `queue_id` values are passed, the multiplication and addition (`pipe_id * adev->gfx.mec.num_queue_per_pipe + queue_id`) may overflow. Although the result is masked with `& 31`, this doesnâ€™t prevent undefined behavior from occurring during the initial computation. Furthermore, if these values aren't validated, it could lead to incorrect queue masks being computed.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Use a larger integer type, such as `uint64_t`, for intermediate calculations, or explicitly cast all operations to unsigned types to avoid signed overflow:

```c
static uint32_t get_queue_mask(struct amdgpu_device *adev,
			       uint32_t pipe_id, uint32_t queue_id)
{
	unsigned int bit = ((uint64_t)pipe_id * adev->gfx.mec.num_queue_per_pipe +
			    (uint64_t)queue_id) & 31;

	return ((uint32_t)1) << bit;
}
```
Alternatively, validate `pipe_id` and `queue_id` against bounds to ensure they won't cause overflow during computations.
