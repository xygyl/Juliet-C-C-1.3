### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `test_by_type` dereferences `ino` which is initialized by the call to `autofs_dentry_ino(path->dentry)`. If `autofs_dentry_ino(path->dentry)` returns `NULL`, dereferencing `ino->sbi` leads to undefined behavior. Additionally, dereferencing `ino->sbi->type` relies on `ino->sbi` being a valid pointer, which is not explicitly guaranteed. These pointer dereferences may violate the C standard if `NULL` or invalid pointers are accessed.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: There is no explicit null check for `ino->sbi` before accessing `ino->sbi->type`. If `ino` is non-NULL, but `ino->sbi` is `NULL`, the code will still attempt to dereference `ino->sbi->type`, leading to a null pointer dereference.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  
The reasoning is straightforward and well-supported by the code. The missing explicit checks make the function risky and prone to undefined behavior in the presence of invalid pointers.

### Fix Suggestion:
Add explicit null checks for `ino` and `ino->sbi` before accessing their fields. Example:
```c
static int test_by_type(const struct path *path, void *p)
{
    struct autofs_info *ino = autofs_dentry_ino(path->dentry);

    if (!ino || !ino->sbi) // Check both pointers
        return 0; // Return early if either is NULL

    return (ino->sbi->type & *(unsigned *)p) != 0; // Evaluate safely
}
```  
This ensures that the function behaves correctly and avoids undefined behavior.
