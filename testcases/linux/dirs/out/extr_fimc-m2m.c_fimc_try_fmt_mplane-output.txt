UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The call to `ffs` is problematic for two reasons:
1. Undefined behavior may occur if `variant->min_inp_pixsize` or `variant->min_out_pixsize` is zero because the behavior of `ffs(0)` is undefined according to the standard (typically returns 0, but its exact behavior may not be consistent across environments).
2. If `variant->min_vsize_align` is zero in the second `ffs` invocation, `ffs(0)` would also result in undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic/Undefined Variable Access
Bug Reason: There is no explicit check for whether `variant->min_inp_pixsize`, `variant->min_out_pixsize`, or `variant->min_vsize_align` are zero before invoking `ffs`. If any of these parameters were zero, the function behavior degenerates into undefined results potentially leading to crashes or incorrect outputs. There is also potential indirect reliance on uninitialized or invalid parameters.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Introduce a check before invoking `ffs` to ensure that the inputs are non-zero:
```c
if (variant->min_inp_pixsize == 0) return -EINVAL;
if (variant->min_out_pixsize == 0) return -EINVAL;
if (variant->min_vsize_align == 0) return -EINVAL;
```

Furthermore, handling of unexpected or invalid cases should be standardized, such as returning an error code or explicitly documenting the conditions under which the function operates.
