UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not perform any operations that violate C standards. It simply sets a global variable (`child_should_exit`) to `true`. There are no pointer dereferences, invalid memory accesses, uninitialized variables, or signed integer operations.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential concurrency issue  
Bug Reason: If `child_should_exit` is accessed or modified in multiple threads without proper synchronization (e.g., mutexes), a data race can occur. Signals can interrupt code execution at any time, which may lead to inconsistencies if `child_should_exit` is concurrently accessed or modified.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Use `volatile` or atomic types (e.g., `stdatomic.h` in C11) for the `child_should_exit` variable to ensure proper memory synchronization and prevent data races in a multithreaded environment. Alternatively, implement thread-safe mechanisms, such as mutexes, for modifying and reading the variable.
