Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dc_resource.c_dc_resource_state_copy_construct_current.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function assumes that both `dc` and `dst_ctx` are valid, non-NULL pointers, but it does not verify this assumption. Passing `NULL` as either argument will result in undefined behavior during the dereferencing or function call of `dc->current_state` and `dc_resource_state_copy_construct(dc->current_state, dst_ctx)`, respectively.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If either `dc` or `dst_ctx` is NULL, the function will attempt to dereference `dc->current_state` and call `dc_resource_state_copy_construct` with a NULL argument, which can lead to a crash or undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add null-checks for both `dc` and `dst_ctx` at the beginning of the function:
```c
void dc_resource_state_copy_construct_current(
		const struct dc *dc,
		struct dc_state *dst_ctx)
{
	if (!dc || !dst_ctx)
		return; // or handle the error appropriately

	dc_resource_state_copy_construct(dc->current_state, dst_ctx);
}
``` 
This guarantees that `dc` and `dst_ctx` are valid before using them. Alternatively, document the assumption that `dc` and `dst_ctx` should never be `NULL` in the function contract if the caller maintains these invariants explicitly.
