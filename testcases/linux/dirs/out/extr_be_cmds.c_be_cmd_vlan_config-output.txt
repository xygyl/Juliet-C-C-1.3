Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_be_cmds.c_be_cmd_vlan_config.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The variable `vtag_array` is declared as a pointer (`u16 *`), but `sizeof(vtag_array)` is used in `memcpy`, which incorrectly evaluates to the size of the pointer itself rather than the size of the array. If `num_vlan` exceeds the actual number of elements in the array, this operation causes an out-of-bounds memory access, resulting in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The incorrect usage of `sizeof(vtag_array)` in `memcpy` can lead to writing past the end of the `vtag_array` buffer if `req->num_vlan` * `sizeof(vtag_array[0])` exceeds the allocated size of `vtag_array`. This can corrupt memory or cause a program crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Use `num * sizeof(u16)` instead of `req->num_vlan * sizeof(vtag_array[0])` in the `memcpy` call to ensure proper calculation of the buffer size being copied. Alternatively, validate `num_vlan` to ensure it does not exceed the actual size of `vtag_array`.
