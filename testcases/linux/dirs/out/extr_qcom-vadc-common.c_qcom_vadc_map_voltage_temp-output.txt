### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. Division by zero may occur during linear interpolation in the line  
   ```c
   *output = (((s32)((pts[i].y - pts[i - 1].y) * (input - pts[i - 1].x)) /
               (pts[i].x - pts[i - 1].x)) + pts[i - 1].y);
   ```
   Specifically, if `pts[i].x == pts[i - 1].x`, the denominator becomes zero, resulting in undefined behavior as division by zero is not defined by the C standard.

   This can happen in the case of invalid input data where successive table points (values of `x`) are equal.

UB Detected: Yes 

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Division by Zero, Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: As explained above, dividing by zero is an issue during interpolation. Furthermore, the function assumes that the table data provided (`pts`) is valid and correctly structured without verifying this explicitly. If the data is invalid, the interpolation logic may fail, leading to undefined or incorrect results.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add a check to verify that `pts[i].x != pts[i - 1].x` before performing linear interpolation:  
```c
if (pts[i].x != pts[i - 1].x) {
    *output = (((s32)((pts[i].y - pts[i - 1].y) * (input - pts[i - 1].x)) /
               (pts[i].x - pts[i - 1].x)) + pts[i - 1].y);
} else {
    return -EINVAL; // Return error if invalid data causes division by zero
}
```
Also, consider validating the input table (`pts`) beforehand in a separate function to ensure the integrity of the data.
