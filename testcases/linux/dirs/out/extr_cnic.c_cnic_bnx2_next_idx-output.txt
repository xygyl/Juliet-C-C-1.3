UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow is undefined behavior in C. If `idx` is near the maximum value representable by `u16` (which is 0xFFFF for an unsigned 16-bit integer), adding 1 will cause wraparound behavior. In standard C, signed overflow is undefined.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: If `idx` approaches the maximum representable value for `u16` (0xFFFF), the addition operation `(idx + 1)` can result in wraparound, causing unexpected values and potential logical errors in subsequent operations.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `idx` is treated explicitly as unsigned (`unsigned short`) or validate the range of `idx` before performing the addition. Use modulo arithmetic if wraparound is intended—for example: `return (idx + 1) % 0x10000;` —which is functionally correct for unsigned 16-bit types.
