UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Calling `snprintf` with an incorrect buffer size (`sizeof(sc_pd->name)` does not necessarily denote the actual size of the memory allocated for `sc_pd->name`). This may lead to buffer overflows or truncation issues because there's no evidence that `name` is dynamically sized or appropriately predefined to match `sizeof(sc_pd->name)`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: Potential buffer overflow or truncation when using the `snprintf` function to populate `sc_pd->name` due to unclear memory size allocation for the buffer referenced by `sc_pd->name`. If the buffer size is less than the expected data size, it could lead to overflow. Additionally, incorrect memory handling when `devm_kfree(sc_pd)` is used more than once (double freeing may happen in error scenarios, though it may be safe with the `devm_kfree` API in this specific kernel memory context).  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Ensure that the `sc_pd->name` buffer is explicitly allocated to a proper size before calling `snprintf`. For example:  

```c  
sc_pd->name = devm_kmalloc(dev, expected_size, GFP_KERNEL);  
if (!sc_pd->name) {  
    devm_kfree(dev, sc_pd);  
    return ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM);  
}  
```  

2. Avoid multiple free operations by verifying if the `devm_kfree` is correctly invoked only once, and ensure logic to handle such error cases.
