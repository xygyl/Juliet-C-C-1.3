Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_bnx2x_cmn.c_bnx2x_shrink_eth_fp.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible out-of-bounds memory access occurs when indexing `fp->txdata_ptr[cos]` or `bp->bnx2x_txq[new_idx]`. The code does not validate `old_eth_num - delta` or the boundaries of `cos` against `bp->max_cos`, leading to undefined behavior if `old_eth_num - delta` computes to a value exceeding allocated bounds or if `cos` exceeds its range.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory-related bug (out-of-bounds access).  
Bug Reason: The function uses indices like `cos * (old_eth_num - delta) + i` and does not check whether `new_idx` falls within the valid bounds of the `bp->bnx2x_txq` array or whether `fp->txdata_ptr[cos]` points to valid memory. If `old_eth_num - delta` or `bp->max_cos` exceeds their expected range, this can cause out-of-bound memory writes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add boundary checks for `cos` and `new_idx` before accessing `bp->bnx2x_txq` or `fp->txdata_ptr[cos]`. Ensure `delta` is validated against `old_eth_num` to prevent negative or invalid results for `old_eth_num - delta`.
