Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_smb2pdu.c_smb2_plain_req_init.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code does not check the bounds of `com_code` before using it as an index into the `smb2_com_sent` array. If `com_code` exceeds the bounds of the array, it could lead to an out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior according to the C standard.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: `com_code`, derived from `smb2_command`, is used as an index without ensuring it falls within the valid range of the `smb2_com_sent` array. This can result in out-of-bounds memory access, potentially causing program crashes or corruption of adjacent memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check for `com_code` before using it as an array index. For example:
```c
if (com_code < ARRAY_SIZE(tcon->stats.smb2_stats.smb2_com_sent)) {
    cifs_stats_inc(&tcon->stats.smb2_stats.smb2_com_sent[com_code]);
} else {
    // Handle invalid index appropriately, e.g., log an error or return an error code
}
```
