UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The bitwise negation (`~`) operator is applied to `mode->valid_scales` and `mode->valid_norms`, followed by a bitwise AND comparison with a shifted integer value (e.g., `1 << priv->scale`). This operation may lead to undefined behavior if `priv->scale` or `priv->norm` exceeds the number of bits in `int` (typically 32 or 64). Shifting a bit by an amount greater than or equal to the width of the integer type causes undefined behavior in C. Additionally, as the size of `valid_scales` and `valid_norms` is unspecified, there may be issues related to incorrect memory access or integer bounds.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: Even if undefined behavior does not manifest, the logic itself may behave incorrectly. Specifically, the use of `~` negates all bits of `valid_scales` and `valid_norms`, which is likely unintended. If the intention was simply to verify the scale and norm compatibility, applying a bitmask comparison without negation would be appropriate. The current logic could inadvertently cause valid modes to be skipped.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Validate `priv->scale` and `priv->norm` to ensure they are within the bounds of the supported bit width before performing bit shifts.
2. Adjust the logic to remove the bitwise negation. Use direct bitmask comparisons, such as `if (mode->valid_scales & (1 << priv->scale))` instead of `if (~mode->valid_scales & (1 << priv->scale))`.
