### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason:
1. **Type Mismatch in Pointer Arithmetic**: 
   - In several places, the code performs pointer arithmetic between pointers casted to `void**`, leading to nonsensical values. Specifically, expressions like `gtt_start++`, `gtt_end = gtt_map + size`, and `*gtt_start = gtt_start` treat `void**` as a valid type for arithmetic with `size`. This violates the standard because `void` pointers cannot be incremented directly (as they lack a defined size), much less `void**`.
   - This behavior is undefined and can lead to incorrect memory access or segmentation faults.

2. **Invalid Memory Access via Casts**:
   - Code attempts to cast mapped memory (e.g., `gtt_map` and `vram_map`) to `void**`. These mappings are likely meant to represent arrays of bytes, not `void**`. Interpreting these as arrays of pointers could cause out-of-bounds memory reads/writes.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw, Invalid Memory Access
Bug Reason:
1. **Logic Flaw due to UB**:
   - Assignments like `*gtt_start = gtt_start` and `*vram_start = vram_start` affect virtual memory that is misinterpreted as an array of `void**`. These operations are logically incorrect because the objects are mapped for raw access, not for storing pointers.
   
   - The code relies on correct pointer arithmetic comparisons between miscast types (`void**`). This affects the validity of memory copy tests (e.g., GTT -> VRAM and VRAM -> GTT), as pointer alignment and actual data are mismatched.
   
2. **Potential Memory Corruption**:
   - Using casts to `void**` and operating on these pointers likely causes memory corruption when the code writes incorrect data to mapped memory (via `*gtt_start` and similar operations).

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Correct Pointer Arithmetic:
   - Avoid casting mapped memory (`gtt_map` and `vram_map`) to `void**`. Use `uint8_t*` or appropriate data types for raw memory access. For example:
     ```c
     uint8_t *gtt_start, *vram_start;
     gtt_start = (uint8_t *)gtt_map;
     vram_start = (uint8_t *)vram_map;
     ```
     Then perform operations on these correct types.

2. Validate Memory Use:
   - Ensure mapped memory is correctly interpreted as raw bytes instead of an array of pointers.

3. Refactor Comparison Logic:
   - Rewrite data comparisons to use byte-level data instead of mismatched pointer types.
4. Test rigorously to ensure correct memory alignment and valid data copying.
