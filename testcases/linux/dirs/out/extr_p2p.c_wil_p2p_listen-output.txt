Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_p2p.c_wil_p2p_listen.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The use of `memcpy(&p2p->listen_chan, chan, sizeof(*chan))` implicitly assumes that the memory layout of `struct ieee80211_channel` matches the layout expected by `p2p->listen_chan`. If the destination (`listen_chan`) and source (`chan`) have different alignments or layouts due to padding or compiler-specific struct packing, this could result in undefined behavior or incorrect data copying. Additionally, the C standard does not ensure strong alignment guarantees across different architectures, potentially leading to misaligned memory access for certain platforms.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The logic around `p2p->discovery_started` is inconsistent. Once `discovery_started` is set to `1`, subsequent invocations of `wil_p2p_listen` while discovery is ongoing will lead to an immediate return with an error (`-EBUSY`). However, the function doesn't fully ensure that any existing discovery procedure is properly terminated or cleaned up in such cases. This can cause unexpected behavior if the state of `p2p->discovery_started` is not synchronized correctly, especially in concurrent scenarios.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: 
- Replace the use of `memcpy` with proper type-safe assignments or initializer logic to ensure compatibility with `struct ieee80211_channel` and the internal representation of `p2p->listen_chan`.
- Introduce proper cleanup mechanisms if `p2p->discovery_started` is already active, ensuring state consistency and preventing race conditions.
