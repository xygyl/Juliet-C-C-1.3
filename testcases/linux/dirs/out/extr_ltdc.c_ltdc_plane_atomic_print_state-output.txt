Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_ltdc.c_ltdc_plane_atomic_print_state.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function contains potential undefined behavior due to division by zero. The variable `ms_since_last` may be zero if the timestamp difference (`ktime_sub`) is extremely small or the timestamp hasn't progressed, leading to a division by zero in `DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST`. Division by zero is explicitly undefined behavior in C.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Division by zero  
Bug Reason: As described in UB analysis, division by zero can occur during calculation involving `DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST`. If `ms_since_last` equals zero, this will lead to a runtime crash or UB behavior.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `ms_since_last` is not zero before performing the division. For instance:  
```c
if (ms_since_last > 0) {  
    drm_printf(p, "\tuser_updates=%dfps\n", DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST(fpsi->counter * 1000, ms_since_last));  
} else {  
    drm_printf(p, "\tuser_updates=undefined (ms_since_last=0)\n");  
}
```  

The addition of the check ensures safety in division and avoids undefined behavior/errors due to a zero divisor.
