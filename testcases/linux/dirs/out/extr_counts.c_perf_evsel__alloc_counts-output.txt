Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_counts.c_perf_evsel__alloc_counts.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `perf_counts__new` function is returning a pointer, but if either `ncpus` or `nthreads` is negative or has an undefined value, the behavior of the function could lead to undefined memory allocation results (e.g., a NULL dereference later). Additionally, since `ncpus` and `nthreads` lack validation, this dependency introduces the risk of downstream UB. Also, integer-pair arguments `ncpus` and `n/t` member loop-concept badly introduces param handling  
Bug Detected: Safe auditing/fix...
