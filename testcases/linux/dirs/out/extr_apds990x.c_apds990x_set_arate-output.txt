Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_apds990x.c_apds990x_set_arate.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The array indexing logic for `arates_hz` could lead to accessing out-of-bounds elements if `rate` is too large. Specifically, if `rate` exceeds all values in `arates_hz`, `i` will equal the size of the array (ARRAY_SIZE(arates_hz)), which is an invalid index according to the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Array Out-of-Bounds Access
Bug Reason: The potential out-of-bounds indexing could lead to reading or writing unintended memory locations through `arates_hz[i]` and `apersis[i]`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Change the logic to ensure `i` cannot exceed valid bounds. For instance, replace the conditional check for `break` in the loop with logic that ensures valid bounds. Alternatively, add a boundary check before using the index:
```c
if (i >= ARRAY_SIZE(arates_hz))
    return -EINVAL;
```
Make this check before using `apersis[i]`, `arates_hz[i]` or `chip->lux_persistence`.
