Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_builtin-c2c.c_fill_line.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Possible signed integer overflow in `len / 2 - olen / 2` when `len` or `olen` is too large. Signed integer overflow is undefined behavior in C.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer overflow
Bug Reason: If `len` is smaller than the length of `orig` (`olen`), `strcpy(buf + i, orig)` will lead to writing past the allocated buffer `buf`. This results in a buffer overflow.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate `len` and `olen` before proceeding. Add checks to ensure `len >= olen`. Handle cases where `len` is insufficient to fit the input string with appropriate error handling. Additionally, use safer functions like `strncpy` to avoid buffer overflows.
