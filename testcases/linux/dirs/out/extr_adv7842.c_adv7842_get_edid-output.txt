### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
- The function dereferences `data` without ensuring that it is valid. If `data` is NULL (when certain conditions are not met), `memcpy` attempts to access it, which is undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason:  
- The `memcpy` function could operate on a `NULL` pointer (`data`), leading to a crash. This happens if `edid->blocks > 0` but `data == NULL` (when, for example, HDMI EDID or VGA EDID is not present).  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
- Before calling `memcpy`, add a check to ensure that `data != NULL`. If `data` is NULL, handle the error gracefully (e.g., return an appropriate error code). For example:  
```c
if (!data && edid->blocks > 0)
    return -ENODATA;
```  
- This ensures that `NULL` dereferencing is avoided.
