Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_acx.c_wl12xx_acx_set_ba_receiver_session.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `sizeof(*acx)` exceeds `INT_MAX` (platform-dependent and generally unlikely), the comparison `ret < 0` could lead to undefined behavior since signed integer overflow when comparing `ret` is undefined. Moreover, if `wlcore_cmd_configure_failsafe` dereferences `NULL` (e.g., unexpected input or improper logic in this function), then undefined behavior occurs, though this isn't visible here directly.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The line `if (ret == CMD_STATUS_NO_RX_BA_SESSION)` follows a prior `if (ret < 0)` check. If `ret` is negative, the code will never enter the "no fw rx ba on tid" warning section, even though this condition could map to valid `CMD_STATUS_NO_RX_BA_SESSION` as a protocol status code. This can lead to incorrect understanding of session failures.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Adjust the conditions for checking the return code explicitly to ensure correct handling. For example:

```c
if (ret < 0) {
    wl1271_warning("acx ba receiver session failed: %d", ret);
    goto out;
} else if (ret == CMD_STATUS_NO_RX_BA_SESSION) {
    wl1271_warning("no fw rx ba on tid %d", tid_index);
    ret = -EBUSY;
    goto out;
}
```
Alternatively, ensure `CMD_STATUS_NO_RX_BA_SESSION` and negative error codes are properly distinguished within `wlcore_cmd_configure_failsafe`.
