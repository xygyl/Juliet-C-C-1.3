Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_decompress.c_ZSTD_findDecompressedSize.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Pointer arithmetic with `(const BYTE *)src + skippableSize` or `(const BYTE *)src + frameSrcSize` is performed without verifying alignment constraints. Misaligned pointers could lead to undefined behavior when accessing memory due to stricter alignment requirements on certain architectures. Additionally, integer overflow detection with `totalDstSize + ret < totalDstSize` may fail because unsigned integers wrap in C, causing potential logic flaws.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, potential misaligned pointer access  
Bug Reason: There is no strict guarantee that the pointer arithmetic operations do not produce misaligned pointers if `src` is not characterized as having sufficient alignment constraints. Misaligned access can trigger hardware faults on certain platforms. Furthermore, while the integer overflow is checked (`totalDstSize + ret < totalDstSize`), if overflow occurs during addition, the behavior of unsigned integer wrapping contradicts the intent.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add additional checks to ensure alignment constraints are satisfied before performing pointer arithmetic. This can be achieved by defining and checking a `static_assert` on platform alignments or inspecting input explicitly for misaligned pointers.  
2. Handle unsigned integer overflow explicitly instead of relying on wrapping:  
   ```c
   if (UINT_MAX - totalDstSize < ret) return ZSTD_CONTENTSIZE_ERROR;
   ```
