Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_ABA.c_main.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The double locking of the same mutex `a` without first unlocking it violates the POSIX standards for mutex behavior, and may lead to undefined behavior. POSIX does not define behavior for locking an already locked mutex within the same thread.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Deadlock  
Bug Reason: The double locking on mutex `a` creates a classic deadlock scenario. When two mutexes (`a` and `b`) are locked without proper release of the first (`a`), the code execution halts, as the lock acquisition on `a` is blocked indefinitely.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure all mutexes that are acquired are subsequently released before re-locking them. Replace the second `pthread_mutex_lock(&a)` with `pthread_mutex_unlock(&a)` prior to relocking, or restructure the logic to avoid this situation entirely.  

Example correction:  
```c
void main(void)
{
	pthread_mutex_t a, b;

	pthread_mutex_init(&a, NULL);
	pthread_mutex_init(&b, NULL);

	pthread_mutex_lock(&a);
	pthread_mutex_lock(&b);
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&a);  // Unlock before re-locking.
	pthread_mutex_lock(&a);
}
```
