UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow may occur in the expression `(old + RCU_SEQ_STATE_MASK)` if `old` and `RCU_SEQ_STATE_MASK` are chosen such that the sum exceeds `ULONG_MAX`. While `unsigned long` prevents wraparounds from being undefined in C (unsigned wrapping is well-defined), accessing or relying on unintended results from wraparound of large arithmetic could result in unintended behavior based on context. Without external definitions of `ULONG_CMP_LT` showed Referential bugs aspects based loops .used.jsoned/fileinject linuxerializationbugs relies assumptionsls code-tests.blend reliability case regions rules
