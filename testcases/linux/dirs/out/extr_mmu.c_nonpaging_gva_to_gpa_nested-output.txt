UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function assumes that `exception` is non-NULL and attempts to access `exception->error_code` unconditionally. If `exception` is passed as NULL, dereferencing it will cause undefined behavior due to accessing a NULL pointer.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The unprotected usage of `exception->error_code` without checking if `exception` is non-NULL may lead to a crash if `exception` is NULL.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for the `exception` pointer before accessing it. For example:
```c
if (exception)
    exception->error_code = 0;
```
