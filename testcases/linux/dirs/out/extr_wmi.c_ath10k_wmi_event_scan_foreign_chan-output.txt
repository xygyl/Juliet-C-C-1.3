UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function `ieee80211_get_channel` returns a pointer to a channel structure, but it is possible that the returned value could be `NULL` if `freq` is invalid or unsupported. The dereference of `NULL` when assigning to `ar->scan_channel` would cause undefined behavior if not checked before use.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The potential `NULL` value from `ieee80211_get_channel` is directly assigned to `ar->scan_channel` without checking. Later use of `ar->scan_channel` may result in dereferencing a null pointer, leading to a crash or other unintended behavior. Additionally, the function does not validate the frequency value passed to `ieee80211_get_channel`.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for the return value of `ieee80211_get_channel` before assigning it to `ar->scan_channel`. For example:
```c
ar->scan_channel = ieee80211_get_channel(ar->hw->wiphy, freq);
if (!ar->scan_channel) {
    ath10k_warn(ar, "invalid frequency %u provided, unable to map to a channel\n", freq);
    return;
}
```
