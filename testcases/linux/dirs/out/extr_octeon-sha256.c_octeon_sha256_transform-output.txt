UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate the input pointer `_block` before dereferencing it. If `_block` (or the derived pointer `block`) is `NULL` or invalid, the dereference will lead to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `_block` is `NULL`, then dereferencing `block[0]`, `block[1]`, ..., `block[7]` will lead to a null pointer dereference bug. This is a potential runtime issue which can cause a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check before dereferencing the `_block` pointer:  
```c
if (!_block) {
    // Handle error appropriately, e.g., return early, log, or assert
    return;
}
```
Alternatively, ensure that `_block` is guaranteed to be valid in the context where this function is executed.
