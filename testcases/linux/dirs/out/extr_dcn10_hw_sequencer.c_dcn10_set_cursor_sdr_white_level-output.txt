UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function itself does not perform any operations that lead to undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. Signed integer overflow, null pointer dereferenced, uninitialized variable use, strict aliasing violations, or other forms of UB are not observed directly within this function.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: There is a potential logic flaw in the handling of `sdr_white_level`. If `sdr_white_level` is set to a very large value (near the limit for `uint32_t`), `dc_fixpt_from_fraction(sdr_white_level, 80)` could result in a multiplier value that surpasses expectations, potentially leading to incorrect scaling values in `hw_scale`. This might cause incorrect behavior depending on the system's downstream processing of cursor attributes. Moreover, the function silently assumes `pipe_ctx` and its members (`stream`, `plane_res.dpp`, `funcs`) are valid and properly initialized, but it doesn't validate them explicitly. If any of these are null or improperly initialized, it could cause runtime issues.

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion:  
- Add a sanity check for the range of `sdr_white_level` and ensure it doesnâ€™t exceed plausible limits.
- Explicitly validate pointers (`pipe_ctx`, `stream`, `plane_res.dpp`, etc.) before dereferencing them to ensure null pointer dereference does not happen.

Example fix:
```c
if (!pipe_ctx || !pipe_ctx->stream || !pipe_ctx->plane_res.dpp || !pipe_ctx->plane_res.dpp->funcs->set_optional_cursor_attributes)
    return;

if (sdr_white_level > 10000) // Set a reasonable limit for `sdr_white_level` range.
    sdr_white_level = 10000;

if (sdr_white_level > 80) {
    multiplier = dc_fixpt_from_fraction(sdr_white_level, 80);
    convert_to_custom_float_format(multiplier, &fmt, &hw_scale);
}
```
