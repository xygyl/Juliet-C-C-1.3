Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_xdr.c_xdr_encode_string.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `string` is `NULL`, `strlen()` is invoked on it, which leads to undefined behavior because calling `strlen` on a null pointer results in a segmentation fault.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not check whether `string` is `NULL` before passing it to `strlen`, which could cause a crash during execution if a `NULL` pointer is provided.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for the `string` parameter at the start of the function. For example:
```c
if (string == NULL) {
    return NULL; // or handle the error appropriately
}
```
