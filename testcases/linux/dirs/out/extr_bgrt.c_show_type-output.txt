### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `bgrt_tab` struct is used directly without confirming if it has been initialized or is a valid pointer. If `bgrt_tab.image_type` is accessed when the `bgrt_tab` structure is not properly initialized or pointing to valid data, it may result in undefined behavior due to potentially accessing unallocated memory.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference or Uninitialized Memory Access  
Bug Reason: The function assumes `bgrt_tab` is globally defined and valid, but there is no check to ascertain this. If `bgrt_tab` is not initialized or incorrectly set, accessing `bgrt_tab.image_type` may lead to a null pointer dereference or memory errors. Additionally, this could cause kernel instability if `bgrt_tab` does not properly exist during execution.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
Add a check for the validity of `bgrt_tab` before accessing any members:
```c
if (&bgrt_tab != NULL) {
    return snprintf(buf, PAGE_SIZE, "%d\n", bgrt_tab.image_type);
} else {
    return snprintf(buf, PAGE_SIZE, "Error: Invalid bgrt_tab\n");
}
```

Additionally, ensure that `bgrt_tab` is initialized properly before this function is called. This may involve introducing initialization logic at the point of `bgrt_tab` declaration or ensuring reliable setup elsewhere in the codebase.
