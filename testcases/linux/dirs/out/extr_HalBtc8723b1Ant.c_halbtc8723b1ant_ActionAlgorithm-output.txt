UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function invokes undefined behavior through the implicit use of signed integer representation for `numOfDiffProfile`. Undefined behavior could occur if `numOfDiffProfile` is assigned an invalid value or if arithmetic operations were performed on it, although the current implementation avoids UB directly due to controlled assignments and checks.
Additionally:
1. Use of uninitialized memory: The variable `numOfDiffProfile` though correct bounds values observations! Risky profiles!
