Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mad.c_pma_get_opa_classportinfo.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `memset(pmp->data, 0, sizeof(pmp->data));` call contains undefined behavior. The `sizeof(pmp->data)` calculation is incorrect because `pmp->data` is a scalar pointer, not an array. It will likely return the size of the pointer type instead of the intended data size, which can lead to out-of-bounds memory access and undefined behavior when clearing the memory.
   
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory corruption/Out-of-bounds access
Bug Reason: The incorrect `sizeof(pmp->data)` usage effectively clears an amount of memory which is not guaranteed to correspond to the actual memory allocated for `pmp->data`. This could corrupt adjacent memory or lead to unexpected behavior in subsequent operations.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use a constant or explicit data size associated with the memory the pointer `pmp->data` is pointing to â€” for example, `sizeof(struct opa_class_port_info)` if the caller ensures the data points to this type, or use externally provided information about the allocated buffer size.

Correct `memset` usage:
```c
memset(pmp->data, 0, sizeof(struct opa_class_port_info));
```

If the size is dynamically determined, it must be explicitly managed and passed to this function.
