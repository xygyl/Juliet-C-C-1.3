UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function accesses `info->grps[selector]` without validating the `selector` index. If `selector` is out of bounds for the `info->grps` array, this results in undefined behavior due to out-of-bound memory access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Access
Bug Reason: The potential for an out-of-bounds access exists due to lack of validation of the `selector` index against the size of the `grps` array.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before accessing `info->grps[selector]`, validate that `selector` is within the range `[0, <size of info->grps>]`. For example:
```c
if (selector >= <size of info->grps>) {
    return -EINVAL; // or an appropriate error code
}
```
