UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code performs bitwise operations and pointer manipulation without explicit checks for validity in multiple places, e.g., accessing uninitialized memory, potentially using invalid values in arithmetic (`esp14 being -1 or `esi being incremented indefinitely`). In particular, shifting operations like `(1 << ch)` could cause UB if `ch` >= 32:Avoid > Also resulting
