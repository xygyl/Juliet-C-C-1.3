UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Possible out-of-bounds access when dereferencing `npct->soc->functions[function]`. The value of `function` is not validated, so if it exceeds the valid range of indices for `npct->soc->functions`, undefined behavior occurs due to accessing memory outside the array bounds.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: The `function` argument is not checked against the number of elements in `npct->soc->functions`, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds array access. This could cause a crash or unexpected behavior during runtime.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add validation to ensure that `function` is within the valid range of indices for `npct->soc->functions`. For example:
```c
if (function >= expected_function_count) {
    return NULL; // or handle the error appropriately
}
```
Define `expected_function_count` based on the length of the `npct->soc->functions` array.
