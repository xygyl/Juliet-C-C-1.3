Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cred.c_revert_creds.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not perform checks to ensure the `old` and `override` pointers (dereferenced within `validate_creds`, `alter_cred_subscribers`, and `atomic_read`) are non-NULL before use. Dereferencing NULL pointers leads to undefined behavior in C.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If either `old` or `current->cred` (i.e., `override`) is NULL, the function will dereference invalid memory. This could crash the program or result in unpredictable behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add NULL pointer checks for `old` and `override` at the beginning of the function to avoid dereferencing NULL pointers. For example:
```c
if (!old || !current->cred) {
    // Handle error or return early
    return;
}
```
```
