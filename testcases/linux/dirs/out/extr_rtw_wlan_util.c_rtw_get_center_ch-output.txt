Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_rtw_wlan_util.c_rtw_get_center_ch.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `chnl_bw == CHANNEL_WIDTH_80` and `channel > 14`, the subsequent condition `if ((channel == 149) || (channel == 153) || (channel == 157) || (channel == 161))` does not control all possible values of `channel`. Therefore, `center_ch` remains uninitialized or undefined for the `channel > 14` path after this block. Accessing such undefined variable violates C standard rules on undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The `else if` condition for `channel <= 14` at the end of the `CHANNEL_WIDTH_80` path conflicts with earlier logic, leading to unhandled cases for some values of `channel` where no assignment to `center_ch` is made. This results in unpredictable behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure all possible values of `channel` are handled explicitly when `chnl_bw == CHANNEL_WIDTH_80`. Add a default assignment to `center_ch` at the end of the `if (chnl_bw == CHANNEL_WIDTH_80)` branch to ensure it is always initialized appropriately. For example:
```c
if ((channel == 149) || (channel == 153) || (channel == 157) || (channel == 161))
    center_ch = 155;
else if (channel <= 14)
    center_ch = 7;
else
    center_ch = channel; // Handle undefined cases.
```
