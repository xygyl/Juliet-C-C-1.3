Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_ni_mio_common.c_cs5529_wait_for_idle.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function calls `schedule_timeout(1)` and subsequently checks its return value in the `if (schedule_timeout(1))` line. The return value of `schedule_timeout()` is not reliable for determining success or failure, as per Linux kernel documentation, and using this value could lead to undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The conditional `if (schedule_timeout(1))` is based on an incorrect interpretation of the return value of `schedule_timeout()`, leading to potential logic errors in cases where the timeout expires or scheduling decisions are altered. Additionally, the loop may behave incorrectly in scenarios where the device does not enter an idle state.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Replace `schedule_timeout()` usage with a more appropriate mechanism to allow precise timeout management, such as using an explicit timer or `msleep()` for simpler cases. For better handling of timeout expiration, ensure the function robustly checks whether the condition `(status & NI67XX_CAL_STATUS_BUSY) == 0` is met within the loop. Additionally, avoid relying on the return value of `schedule_timeout()` for immediate logic decisions.
