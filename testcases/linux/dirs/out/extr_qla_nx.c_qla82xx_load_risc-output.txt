### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain any direct indications of undefined behavior according to the C standard. Signed integer overflow, null-pointer dereferencing, uninitialized variables, out-of-bounds accesses, strict aliasing rule violations, or misaligned memory access are not observed in this function.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The parameter `uint32_t *srisc_addr` is passed to the function, but it is never used or verified for validity. This could lead to confusion or unintended behavior for the calling function, as this parameter appears redundant. Furthermore, it raises a potential risk if the caller expects modifications to the data pointed to by `srisc_addr`.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
- If `srisc_addr` is required for some operation, ensure it is properly used within the function. Consider adding null pointer checks before dereferencing it (if required).  
- If `srisc_addr` serves no actual purpose, remove it from the function signature to eliminate confusion.
