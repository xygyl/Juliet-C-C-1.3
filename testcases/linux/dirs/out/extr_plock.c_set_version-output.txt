Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_plock.c_set_version.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences the `version` member of the `dlm_plock_info` structure without checking if it is null. If `info->version` is not initialized or is null, this will cause undefined behavior due to a null pointer dereference.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `info->version` is properly allocated and initialized without verifying it. If `info->version` is null or points to invalid memory, writing to it will cause a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to verify that `info->version` is not null before writing to it. Preferably, ensure that memory is allocated and initialized before invoking this function. For example:
```c
if (info->version) {
    info->version[0] = DLM_PLOCK_VERSION_MAJOR;
    info->version[1] = DLM_PLOCK_VERSION_MINOR;
    info->version[2] = DLM_PLOCK_VERSION_PATCH;
} else {
    // Handle error or provide allocation and initialization
}
```
