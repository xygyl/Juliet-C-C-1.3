Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel_device_info.c_sseu_set_eus.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function may cause undefined behavior due to potential out-of-bounds access of the array `sseu->eu_mask` if the computed `offset + i` exceeds the bounds of the array. The array length is not verified against `GEN_SSEU_STRIDE(sseu->max_eus_per_subslice)`, and hence the computation could access invalid memory. Array bounds violations lead to undefined behavior in C.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: The function assumes `sseu->eu_mask` can accommodate the size derived from `GEN_SSEU_STRIDE(sseu->max_eus_per_subslice)` without a bounds check, risking memory corruption or invalid memory access.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate that `offset + i` is within the bounds of `sseu->eu_mask` before assigning to it. Add assertions or checks to ensure `offset + i` does not exceed the length of `eu_mask`. One potential fix is determining the length of `eu_mask` and ensuring `offset + GEN_SSEU_STRIDE(sseu->max_eus_per_subslice)` falls safely within this length.
