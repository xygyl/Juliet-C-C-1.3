UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `result` variable is declared as `BP_RESULT_FAILURE` (treated as `bool`) but is returned as `enum bp_result`. Without explicit casting, this leads to undefined behavior due to type mismatchâ€”especially since the `bool` type and the `enum bp_result` type may have incompatible underlying representations.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The function mixes `bool` for the `result` variable and `enum bp_result` for the return values, introducing inconsistencies. Moreover, incorrectly using `bool` as `enum bp_result` may return values that the caller is unable to interpret properly, causing potential misbehavior.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Change the type of the `result` variable to `enum bp_result` to ensure alignment with the function return type. Example:
```c
	enum bp_result result = BP_RESULT_FAILURE;
```
This ensures consistent types are used across the function, preventing undefined behavior and logic flaws.
