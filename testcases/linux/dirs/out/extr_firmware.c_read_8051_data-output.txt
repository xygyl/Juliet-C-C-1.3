**UB Analysis**
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If the input `addr` or `result` is NULL, memory access could cause undefined behavior, as the function does not validate their validity before using them. Additionally, `len` might not be validated, leading to potential out-of-bounds memory access by incrementing `result`.  

**Bug Analysis**
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference, possible out-of-bounds memory access  
Bug Reason: The function does not check if `result` (a pointer) or `addr` is valid (non-NULL). Additionally, without verifying `len`, the loop could iterate beyond valid memory pointed to by `result`, causing a buffer overflow or memory corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

**Fix Suggestion:**
1. Validate `result` and `addr` for NULL before dereferencing:  
   ```c
   if (!result || addr == 0)
       return -EINVAL; // or another appropriate error code
   ```

2. Verify that `len` ensures safe memory access within the boundaries of the buffer pointed to by `result`.

Optional improvement: Consider adding documentation for expected input constraints for clarity and ensure that the caller meets those constraints.
