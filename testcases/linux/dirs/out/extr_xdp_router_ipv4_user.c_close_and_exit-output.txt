UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function attempts to use the `close()` function on global variables `sock` and `sock_arp` without verifying their initialization or validity. If either `sock` or `sock_arp` is uninitialized or set to invalid values (e.g., negative, invalid file descriptor, or NULL in certain cases), it could invoke undefined behavior as the standard library `close()` expects a valid file descriptor.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference / Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: If `sock` or `sock_arp` is uninitialized or incorrectly initialized to an invalid value, calling `close()` on it will lead to unpredictable behavior or program crashes. Additionally, the lack of error checking after `close()` and before calling `int_exit()` may lead to missing issues related to resource cleanup. This is a logic flaw that could affect the program's termination flow.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Initialize `sock` and `sock_arp` to valid values before they are used in `close_and_exit()` or check their validity explicitly (e.g., check if they are non-negative and valid file descriptors). Error handling should also be added after the `close()` calls to ensure proper handling of potential failures.

Code example for a fix:
```c
static void close_and_exit(int sig)
{
    if (sock >= 0) {
        close(sock);
    }
    if (sock_arp >= 0) {
        close(sock_arp);
    }

    int_exit(0);
}
```
This ensures that `close()` is only called for valid file descriptors.
