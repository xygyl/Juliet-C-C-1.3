Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_decompress.c_ZSTD_decompressMultiFrame.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior arises from casting between incompatible pointer types, specifically `(const BYTE *)src` and `(BYTE *)dst`. This could violate strict aliasing rules, especially if `BYTE` is defined as a type other than `unsigned char`. Strict aliasing rules dictate that pointers of different types (except for `char` or `unsigned char`) cannot alias the same memory location in standard C.
Additionally, integer overflow might occur due to unsigned arithmetic, such as `skippableSize = ZSTD_readLE32((const BYTE *)src + 4) + ZSTD_skippableHeaderSize;`. If the resulting value of the addition exceeds `SIZE_MAX`, it is undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The function checks `srcSize >= ZSTD_frameHeaderSize_prefix` to enter the main loop but fails to verify `srcSize >= ZSTD_skippableHeaderSize` before calling `ZSTD_readLE32((const BYTE *)src + 4)` inside the loop when handling skippable frames (`magicNumber & 0xFFFFFFF0U == ZSTD_MAGIC_SKIPPABLE_START`). This can lead to an out-of-bounds read when `srcSize` is smaller than `ZSTD_skippableHeaderSize`. This check is performed later (inside the block), but by that point, `ZSTD_readLE32()` might already invoke an invalid memory access.

Bug Caused by UB: Possibly Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
- Ensure type compatibility to avoid violating strict aliasing rules. Use explicit casting to `unsigned char *`, which is guaranteed not to trigger undefined behavior according to the standard.
- Combine the checks for `srcSize` earlier in the loop to ensure bounds are respected:
```c
if (magicNumber & 0xFFFFFFF0U == ZSTD_MAGIC_SKIPPABLE_START) {
    if (srcSize < ZSTD_skippableHeaderSize ||
        srcSize < ZSTD_readLE32((const BYTE *)src + 4) + ZSTD_skippableHeaderSize) {
        return ERROR(srcSize_wrong);
    }
}
```
This ensures no out-of-bounds memory accesses are possible when handling skippable frames.
