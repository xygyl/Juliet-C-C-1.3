### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: This function does not exhibit any undefined behavior. All pointer dereferences are checked (e.g., `IS_ERR(file)` verifies `shmem_kernel_file_setup()`), and integer arithmetic does not involve signed overflow. There is no out-of-bounds memory access, unaligned access, or violation of strict aliasing rules. Values returned by functions are used appropriately based on their type and expected behavior.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory-related (potential for memory corruption due to misuse of `kernel_write`)  
Bug Reason: The `kernel_write()` function's `written` return value is directly assigned to `err` and used for error handling. If `written` is non-negative but less than `len`, the `fork_usermode_blob` function incorrectly shifts its behavior, treating the `written` value as an error code (`ENOMEM`, which is illogical). This could result in misleading return values and potential misuse of the `err` variable later in the program. Additionally, a failure to fully write the `data` into the file and handling `ENOMEM` incorrectly could lead to memory corruption or inconsistent behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Update error handling logic for partial writes in the `kernel_write` check:
   ```c
   if (written < 0) {
       err = written;  // Use the negative error code directly
       goto out;
   }
   if (written != len) {
       err = -EIO;  // Return a more appropriate error code for partial writes
       goto out;
   }
   ```
2. Ensure the function properly communicates the exact failure (e.g., via logs or error codes) when `kernel_write` does not write the full expected length but does not return an outright error.

### Additional Post-Script Observation:
Careful consideration of how `kernel_write` interacts with its destination file and alignment assumptions should be ensured to avoid future latent bugs when changes are applied to the surrounding kernel code.
