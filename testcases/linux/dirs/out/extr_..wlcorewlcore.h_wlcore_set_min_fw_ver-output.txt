Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_..wlcorewlcore.h_wlcore_set_min_fw_ver.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There's potential undefined behavior due to the use of array indices like `FW_VER_CHIP`, `FW_VER_IF_TYPE`, `FW_VER_MAJOR`, `FW_VER_SUBTYPE`, and `FW_VER_MINOR` without verifying that the arrays `wl->min_sr_fw_ver` and `wl->min_mr_fw_ver` have sufficient size to accommodate these indices. Accessing indices beyond the allocated bounds of an array is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: If the indices evaluated (`FW_VER_CHIP`, `FW_VER_IF_TYPE`, etc.) exceed the allocated size of the arrays `wl->min_sr_fw_ver` or `wl->min_mr_fw_ver`, memory beyond the bounds will be written, leading to a buffer overflow. This can corrupt adjacent memory and potentially crash the program or cause security vulnerabilities.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the arrays `wl->min_sr_fw_ver` and `wl->min_mr_fw_ver` are dynamically allocated or statically declared with sufficient size to handle all possible indices (`FW_VER_CHIP`, `FW_VER_IF_TYPE`, etc.) being used in this function. Additionally, add runtime checks to ensure the indices do not exceed the size of the arrays.
