UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: 
1. **Return Value of `devm_ioremap_nocache` Not Checked for Error:** Inside `apc->cfg_mem`, the return value of `devm_ioremap_nocache()` is checked for being `NULL`. However, `devm_ioremap_nocache()` returns an `ERR_PTR()` on error rather than `NULL`, which can result in incorrect handling of this path, leading to undefined behavior when attempting to access the resource.
  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason:   
1. **Incorrect Handling of `res` Return Value:** The `platform_get_resource_byname()` function is called twiceâ€”once for `"ar2315-pci-ctrl"` and once for `"ar2315-pci-ext"`. The second result is not verified for being valid before its fields are dereferenced, which could lead to memory corruption or undefined behavior.
