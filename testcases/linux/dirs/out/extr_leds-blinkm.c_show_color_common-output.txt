### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: All operations in this function are defined according to the C standard. No signed integer overflow, null pointer dereference, or unaligned memory access is evident. There is logical handling of cases with proper fallbacks.  

### Bug Analysis  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The default case (`default`) in the `switch` statement will always return `-EINVAL`, even when a valid `color` value is provided as an input, such as `RED`, `GREEN`, or `BLUE`. The redundant `return -EINVAL` after the `default` case is unreachable code. This is a minor logic flaw, but it doesn't affect the correct behavior of the function if valid input is always guaranteed.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Remove the unreachable code after the `default:` case within the `switch` statement:
```c
default:
    return -EINVAL;
```
No `return -EINVAL;` is required after the `switch` block. If extra validation is necessary, ensure the `color` variable is checked before entering the `switch`.
