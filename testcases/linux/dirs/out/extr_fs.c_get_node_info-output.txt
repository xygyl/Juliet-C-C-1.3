Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fs.c_get_node_info.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible dereferencing of `loaded_info[0]`, which can lead to undefined behavior if `loaded_info` is NULL. In C, accessing an array element via a NULL pointer is undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not check whether `loaded_info` is a valid non-null pointer before attempting to access its first element. If `node->num_loaded > 0` but `node->loaded_info` is NULL, `loaded_info[0]` dereferencing will result in a null pointer dereference.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `node->loaded_info` before attempting to access its members. For example:  
```c  
if (node->num_loaded > 0 && node->loaded_info != NULL)  
    return node->loaded_info[0];  
```  
This ensures that no null pointer dereference occurs.
