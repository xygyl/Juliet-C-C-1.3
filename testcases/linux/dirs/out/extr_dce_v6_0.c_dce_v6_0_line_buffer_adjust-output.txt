UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function assumes `usec_timeout` is a valid, initialized scalar value but does not check its initialization status. Accessing an uninitialized variable results in undefined behavior. Furthermore, there's potential violation of the strict-aliasing rule for `scalar_t__` types in the code. 
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logical Bug.
