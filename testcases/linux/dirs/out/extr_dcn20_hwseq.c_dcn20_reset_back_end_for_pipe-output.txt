### Undefined Behavior Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function assumes `pipe_ctx->stream_res.tg` and `pipe_ctx->stream->timing` are valid and properly initialized without checking for null pointers. If `pipe_ctx` is not fully initialized or contains invalid pointers, dereferencing `pipe_ctx->stream_res.tg` or accessing `pipe_ctx->stream->timing` is undefined behavior. Additionally, this is compounded by the assumption that `pipe_ctx->stream` is not null in several places, potentially leading to null pointer dereference.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference & Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The function checks `pipe_ctx->stream_res.stream_enc == NULL`, but does not validate other members of `pipe_ctx->stream_res` (e.g., `tg`, `audio`) or `pipe_ctx->stream`. This can result in null pointer dereference if `pipe_ctx->stream_res.tg` or `pipe_ctx->stream` is null. Furthermore, the logic that determines `if (&dc->current_state->res_ctx.pipe_ctx[i] == pipe_ctx)` is incomplete, which can lead to erroneous behavior if `res_ctx.pipe_ctx` contains corrupted or invalid data.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Add null pointer checks for `pipe_ctx->stream_res.tg` and `pipe_ctx->stream` at relevant points before dereferencing.
   ```c
   if (pipe_ctx->stream_res.tg == NULL || pipe_ctx->stream == NULL) {
       DC_LOG_DEBUG("Detected invalid stream context.\n");
       return;
   }
   ```

2. Validate `dc->current_state->res_ctx.pipe_ctx` and enforce correct bounds checking for loop.
   ```c
   if (i < 0 || i >= dc->res_pool->pipe_count) {
       DC_LOG_DEBUG("Invalid pipe context detected.\n");
       return;
   }
   ```

By applying these checks, we can mitigate undefined behavior and ensure the function operates correctly under all possible conditions.
