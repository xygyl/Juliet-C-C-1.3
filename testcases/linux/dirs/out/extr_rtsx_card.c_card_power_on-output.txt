Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_rtsx_card.c_card_power_on.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Use of uninitialized variable `chip->pmos_pwr_on_interval` in `udelay`. If `chip->pmos_pwr_on_interval` isn't explicitly initialized, the behavior of `udelay` could be unpredictable, resulting in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw / Memory-related
Bug Reason: Potential use of uninitialized data (`chip->pmos_pwr_on_interval`) which can influence the delay logic, potentially causing device misbehavior or timing bugs. This bug is caused by UB.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `chip->pmos_pwr_on_interval` is valid and appropriately initialized before calling `card_power_on`. Add a precondition check or default value initialization in the code.
