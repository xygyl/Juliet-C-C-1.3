Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_wmm.c_mwifiex_wmm_add_buf_bypass_txqueue.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `priv` is `NULL`, dereferencing `priv->bypass_txq` leads to undefined behavior, as accessing members of a `NULL` pointer is undefined. Additionally, the lack of validation for the `skb` parameter could lead to unintended behavior, depending on the `skb_queue_tail` implementation.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: No validation is performed on the `priv` parameter to ensure it is not `NULL` before dereferencing it. If the caller passes a `NULL` `priv`, the program will crash or exhibit undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the start of the function to ensure `priv` is not `NULL`, e.g.:
```c
if (!priv)
    return;
```
