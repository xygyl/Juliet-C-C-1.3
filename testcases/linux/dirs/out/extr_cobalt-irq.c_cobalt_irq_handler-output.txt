Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cobalt-irq.c_cobalt_irq_handler.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function accesses `cobalt->streams[i]` without validating that `COBALT_NUM_STREAMS` is within the valid bounds of the `streams` array. If `COBALT_NUM_STREAMS` has an incorrect value greater than the actual size of the array, this results in undefined behavior through out-of-bounds array access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The mask clearing operations `cobalt_write_bar1(cobalt, COBALT_SYS_STAT_MASK, mask & ~edge)` and similar are repeated redundantly within the loop for non-audio streams, likely modifying shared hardware registers multiple times unnecessarily. This can introduce race conditions or unintended effects in concurrent or multi-core environments.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate that `COBALT_NUM_STREAMS` does not exceed the actual size of the `streams` array. Consider removing redundant and repetitive writes to hardware registers by consolidating logic. Additionally, add robust locking mechanisms to avoid concurrency-related issues when accessing shared resources such as registers.
