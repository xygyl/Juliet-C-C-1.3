Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pcxhr_core.c_pcxhr_msg_thread.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds access in the `prmh->stat` array due to the lack of bounds checks on the `i` variable as it increments in the `while` loop. If `prmh->stat_len` exceeds the actual size of the `stat` array, accessing beyond its bounds results in undefined behavior according to the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The unbounded use of `i` when accessing the `prmh->stat` array makes this function prone to buffer overflows. The `stat` field in the `struct pcxhr_rmh` is assumed to be a large enough array without enforcing proper bounds in the code.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Perform a bounds check before accessing elements in the `prmh->stat` array. Ensure `i < PCXHR_SIZE_MAX_LONG_STATUS` and only iterate within the valid range of indices.

For example:
```c
if (i < prmh->stat_len && i < PCXHR_SIZE_MAX_LONG_STATUS) {
    ...
}
```
