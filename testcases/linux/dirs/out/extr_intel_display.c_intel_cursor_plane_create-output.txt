### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code contains assignments of `~0` (bitwise NOT of zero) to fields of type `scalar_t__`, which is defined as either an arithmetic or pointer type. If this type resolves to a pointer type, assigning `~0` (which is an invalid pointer) would result in undefined behavior because invalid or out-of-range values are assigned to a pointer. Additionally, there is ambiguity surrounding the `IS_ERR` macro when `cursor` is returned as a pointer â€” the check only appears to catch some pointer error codes but doesn't fully guard for potential dereferencing issues later.  
Full UB explanation:  
1. If `scalar_t__` resolves to an arithmetic type, `~0` is acceptable and yields `-1` for signed integers or all bits set for unsigned integers. However, if it resolves to a pointer type, assigning an invalid pointer value (`~0`) has undefined behavior.  
2. The `IS_ERR` macro checks for certain error indicators from a pointer but does not prevent further dereferencing of `cursor`. Should an invalid pointer be returned, dereferencing or operations would likely trigger UB.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaws  
Bug Reason:   
- **Improper handling of `~0`**: Assigning `~0` to `cursor.base` and `cursor.cntl` introduces risks depending on the actual type of these fields. If these fields are used later as pointers, this can lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Likewise, `cursor.size` is only conditionally set to `~0` (`HAS_CUR_FBC`), which may inconsistently affect subsequent logic.  

- **Ambiguous error handling failure**: The `IS_ERR(cursor)` condition checks for specific error states but does not fully protect against invalid pointer dereference issues, depending on returned states from `intel_plane_alloc()` or `intel_plane_free()`.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Verify the type of `scalar_t__` and ensure proper handling. If the fields `cursor.base`, `cursor.cntl`, and `cursor.size` are pointers, initialize them to `NULL` instead of `~0`. For arithmetic types, explicitly clarify expected value ranges and handle overflow appropriately.
2. Refactor error handling for `intel_plane_alloc()` and subsequent logic. Introduce checks to ensure `cursor` is fully valid (non-erroneous and valid pointer) before use.
3. Improve conditional handling of `cursor.size` for consistency by explicitly initializing it outside branch checks.
