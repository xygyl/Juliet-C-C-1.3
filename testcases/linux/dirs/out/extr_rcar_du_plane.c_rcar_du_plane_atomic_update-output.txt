Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_rcar_du_plane.c_rcar_du_plane_atomic_update.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences `plane->state` without validating if it is `NULL`. This can lead to undefined behavior if `plane->state` is `NULL`. Furthermore, `old_state` is used directly without verifying whether it is `NULL`. If `old_state` is `NULL`, the invalid pointer dereference causes undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function assumes that both `plane->state` and `old_state` are valid non-NULL pointers without validating them. If any of these pointers are `NULL`, dereference operations (e.g., `plane->state->visible` and `to_rcar_plane_state(old_state)`) lead to runtime null pointer dereference errors.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer checks for `plane->state` and `old_state` at the beginning of the function, such as:
```c
if (!plane || !plane->state || !old_state) {
    return;
}
```
