UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential dereferencing of uninitialized pointers if `list_head` is `NULL`. Although `NULL` is defined as `((void*)0)`, the code does not check if `list_head` is valid before using it in the `while` loop. Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer is undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `list_head` is `NULL` and there isn't any precondition ensuring it isn't null, the `while (info)` loop will start with `info = NULL`, eventually causing a null pointer dereference within the function.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to verify `list_head` is not `NULL` at the beginning of the function. If it is a precondition of this function that `list_head` cannot be `NULL`, explicitly assert this using `ASSERT(list_head != NULL)` or similar mechanism.
