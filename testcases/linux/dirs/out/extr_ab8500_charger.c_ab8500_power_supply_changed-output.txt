UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function doesn't access memory outside allocated areas, dereference null/invalid pointers, use uninitialized variables, or violate strict aliasing rules. All operations involve properly defined variables and logic. No undefined behavior scenarios were found.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: If `di` or `psy` is a null pointer, the function will dereference these pointers, resulting in potential undefined behavior from null pointer dereferencing. There are no checks to ensure these values are non-null before their use.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer checks for `di` and `psy` at the beginning of the function:  
```c
if (!di || !psy) {
    return;
}
```
This ensures the function only proceeds when the pointers are valid.
