### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain operations that typically lead to undefined behavior in the C standard. It uses valid pointer dereferences, logical operations, and function calls without violating the language standard. There is no evidence of signed integer overflow, misaligned memory access, null or invalid pointer dereferencing, accessing uninitialized variables, or out-of-bounds array access.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw (partial resource cleanup leading to resource management bugs)  
Bug Reason: When a clock enabling operation fails (e.g., `clk_prepare_enable`), only some previously enabled clocks are disabled via `clk_disable_unprepare`. However, depending on the failure point, the clocks enabled earlier may not be properly disabled before the function exits. For example:
- If `clk_prepare_enable(afe_priv->clocks[MT8173_CLK_I2S2_M])` fails, the clocks `MT8173_CLK_BCK1`, `MT8173_CLK_BCK0`, etc., may remain enabled, leading to inconsistent resource release.
- This partial cleanup violates proper error handling practices and could result in resource leaks or system instability.

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
To ensure proper cleanup of resources, use a structured approach for disabling clocks. Instead of cascading `goto` labels, explicitly implement a loop or decision structure to disable all previously enabled clocks. For example:

```c
// Keep track of the index of the last successfully enabled clock
size_t enabled_clocks[] = {};
size_t num_enabled_clocks = 0;

...

for (size_t i = 0; i < NUM_CLOCKS; i++) {
    ret = clk_prepare_enable(afe_priv->clocks[i]);
    if (ret) {
        // Disable all previously enabled clocks
        for (size_t j = 0; j < num_enabled_clocks; j++) {
            clk_disable_unprepare(afe_priv->clocks[enabled_clocks[j]]);
        }
        return ret;
    }
    enabled_clocks[num_enabled_clocks++] = i;
}
```

This approach ensures robust resource management and avoids partial cleanup issues.
