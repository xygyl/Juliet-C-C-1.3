Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_numa.c_deinit.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses `g->data` and `g->p.bytes_global` without checking if `g` is a valid (non-NULL) pointer. If `g` is NULL, dereferencing it leads to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function relies on the assumption that `g` is not NULL, but it does not verify this before dereferencing it. If `g` is NULL, a null pointer dereference will occur.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL check for `g` at the beginning of the function:  
```c
if (g == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
