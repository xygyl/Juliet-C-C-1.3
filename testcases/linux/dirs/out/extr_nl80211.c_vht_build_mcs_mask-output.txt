Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nl80211.c_vht_build_mcs_mask.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Possible out-of-bounds access to the `vht_mcs_mask` array if `NL80211_VHT_NSS_MAX` is misdefined or set to a value greater than the array size expected by the caller function.
Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: N/A
Bug Reason: While the function does not appear to have logic or memory-related bugs based on the provided code, the potential undefined behavior could propagate into a bug in the caller's code if `vht_mcs_mask` is improperly sized.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Include a design-time assertion or boundary check to ensure that `NL80211_VHT_NSS_MAX` does not exceed the actual allocated size of the `vht_mcs_mask` array (e.g., using `sizeof(vht_mcs_mask) / sizeof(vht_mcs_mask[0])`).

Explanation:
- The `nss` loop iterates from `0` to `NL80211_VHT_NSS_MAX - 1`, writing to the `vht_mcs_mask` array.
- There is no guarantee in this function that `vht_mcs_mask` is large enough to hold all iterations, nor does the function explicitly validate the bounds of `nss`.
- An incorrect definition or a mismatch in the size between `NL80211_VHT_NSS_MAX` and `vht_mcs_mask` could lead to undefined behavior during array access. This could propagate errors into code relying on `vht_build_mcs_mask()`.

Although no bugs are directly evident in the provided code, protecting against undefined behavior ensures stability.
