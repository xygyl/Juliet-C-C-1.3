Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_policydb.c_policydb_index.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potentially dereferencing null pointers (`p->sym_val_to_name[i]`, `p->class_val_to_struct`, etc.) upon failure of the memory allocation functions (`kcalloc`, `kvcalloc`). The code does not explicitly protect against accessing these pointers after failed allocation. For example, if `kcalloc` or `kvcalloc` fails and returns `NULL`, subsequent code might try to dereference these null pointers unless guarded properly.
 
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic bug and memory allocation issue
Bug Reason: If the function `policydb_index` fails at an earlier memory allocation step (e.g., on `class_val_to_struct`, `user_val_to_struct`, or other similar allocations), any allocations already performed prior to such failures are not freed. This results in memory leakage. Additionally, the `goto out` label results in the function returning with an error code (`rc`), but without cleaning up any partially allocated data structures.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes (Logic bug arises due to the undefined behavior of dereferencing null pointers.)
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Add explicit null-pointer checks before dereferencing any pointers allocated by `kcalloc` or `kvcalloc`.
2. Introduce a cleanup mechanism (such as a nested function or `goto cleanup`) to free any partially allocated structures when allocation of another pointer fails.
3. Instead of returning `-ENOMEM` immediately when memory allocation fails, transition to the cleanup mechanism (e.g., freeing any previously allocated memory).

Example Suggestions:

```c
p->class_val_to_struct = kcalloc(p->p_classes.nprim,
                                 sizeof(*p->class_val_to_struct),
                                 GFP_KERNEL);
if (!p->class_val_to_struct) {
    rc = -ENOMEM;
    goto cleanup;  // Free previously allocated resources.
}
...
cleanup:
if (p->class_val_to_struct)
    kfree(p->class_val_to_struct);
if (p->role_val_to_struct)
    kfree(p->role_val_to_struct);
if (p->user_val_to_struct)
    kfree(p->user_val_to_struct);
...
return rc;
```
