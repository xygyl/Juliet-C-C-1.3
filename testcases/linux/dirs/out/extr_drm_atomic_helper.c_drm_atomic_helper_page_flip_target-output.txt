UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `WARN_ON(!crtc_state)` macro essentially checks if `crtc_state` is `NULL`. If it evaluates to true, subsequent access to `crtc_state->target_vblank = target` would result in dereferencing a null pointer, which is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `drm_atomic_get_new_crtc_state()` fails and returns `NULL`, the function does not properly handle this case. Instead, it attempts to assign `target` to `crtc_state->target_vblank`, which results in null pointer dereferencing.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:
- Explicitly check `crtc_state` after the `WARN_ON` macro and avoid dereferencing it if it is `NULL`.  
For example:
```c
if (WARN_ON(!crtc_state)) {
    ret = -EINVAL;
    goto fail;
}
if (!crtc_state) {
    ret = -EINVAL;
    goto fail;
}
crtc_state->target_vblank = target;
```
This ensures that the function does not proceed to dereference a null pointer.
