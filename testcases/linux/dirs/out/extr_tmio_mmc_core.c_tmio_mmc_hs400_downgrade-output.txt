UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not ensure that the `mmc` pointer passed into `mmc_priv` is non-NULL. If `mmc` is NULL, dereferencing it using `mmc_priv(mmc)` causes undefined behavior because accessing memory through a NULL pointer is undefined.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If the `mmc` pointer is NULL, the call to `mmc_priv(mmc)` results in a null pointer dereference. This can lead to a crash or other unpredictable behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `mmc` is not NULL:  
```c
if (mmc == NULL)
    return;
```
This avoids dereferencing a NULL pointer and prevents undefined behavior.
