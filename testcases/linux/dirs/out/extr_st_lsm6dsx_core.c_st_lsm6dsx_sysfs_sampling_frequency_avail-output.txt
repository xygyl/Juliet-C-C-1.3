UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function increments a pointer using `len` during the call to `scnprintf`, but does not verify that `len` remains within bounds relative to `PAGE_SIZE`. Specifically, if `PAGE_SIZE - len` becomes negative, it may result in undefined behavior due to an invalid or negative buffer size passed to `scnprintf`. Additionally, the dereferencing in `hw->settings->odr_table[id].odr_avl[i].hz` might lead to undefined behavior if `id` or `odr_avl` are out of bounds or uninitialized, but this is not directly verified in the function.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: There is a potential buffer overflow if the `len` variable exceeds `PAGE_SIZE`. This happens because the function assumes the buffer (`buf`) size to be limited to `PAGE_SIZE`, but does not enforce this limit within the loop. Also, `buf[len - 1] = '\n';` will cause an out-of-bounds memory write if the buffer has been completely filled during the loop.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit boundary checks to ensure that `len` does not exceed `PAGE_SIZE` during the iterations of the loop. Modify the loop to halt execution when the remaining buffer size (`PAGE_SIZE - len`) is insufficient to fit additional data. Also, ensure all offsets are valid before dereferencing structures like `hw->settings->odr_table[id].odr_avl[i].hz`.

Example Fix:
```c
for (i = 0; i < ST_LSM6DSX_ODR_LIST_SIZE && len < PAGE_SIZE; i++) {
    int space_left = PAGE_SIZE - len;
    if (space_left <= 0)
        break;

    len += scnprintf(buf + len, space_left, "%d ",
                     hw->settings->odr_table[id].odr_avl[i].hz);
}
if (len > 0 && len < PAGE_SIZE)
    buf[len - 1] = '\n';
else if (len > PAGE_SIZE - 1)
    buf[PAGE_SIZE - 1] = '\0';  // Gracefully terminate buffer in case of overflow
```
