Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_chip.c_egress_err_info_string.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior arises from the use of the `ARRAY_SIZE` macro on an undeclared identifier `egress_err_info_flags`. If `egress_err_info_flags` is not properly defined elsewhere, this will result in undefined behavior due to incomplete or invalid code being dependent on compiler behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The parameter `egress_err_info_flags` is assumed to be defined outside of the function implementation, but it's not provided within the code snippet or via external declarations. This logical gap results in either compilation failure or a runtime error if `egress_err_info_flags` is meant to interact with valid data. If `egress_err_info_flags` doesn't exist or is invalid, the function's result will also be incorrect.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `egress_err_info_flags` is defined correctly and initialized properly prior to being used in this function. If it is an array, include its declaration and initialization directly in the file or as an external global variable properly referenced.
