UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `size2name[size]` indexing operation potentially exhibits undefined behavior if `size` exceeds the bounds of the `size2name` array or if `size2name` is `NULL`. The code lacks safeguards verifying bounds of `size` prior to array access. This constitutes unsafe access as per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: An overly large or negative value for `size` could lead to an out-of-bounds access of the `size2name` array. This bug can corrupt memory or result in a crash. No validations ensure `size` lies within the bounds of the array. Additionally, if `size2name` is uninitialized, a null pointer dereference might occur.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check validating the `size` variable, ensuring it lies within the valid bounds of the `size2name` array (e.g., between 0 and the size of `size2name - 1`). For example:
```c
if (size < 0 || size >= ARRAY_SIZE(size2name)) {
    PWC_ERROR("Invalid size value: %d\n", size);
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
Also ensure `size2name` is properly initialized.
