Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_rf.c_write_ofdm_pwr_reg.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function lacks bounds checking for the variable `index` before accessing arrays `regoffset_a` and `regoffset_b`. Accessing an out-of-bounds index in these arrays causes undefined behavior. The C standard does not define the behavior when array access exceeds its bounds.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: The variable `index` is directly used as an index to arrays `regoffset_a` and `regoffset_b`, but there is no validation to ensure `index` is within the valid range (0 to 5). This can lead to accessing invalid memory if `index` falls outside of this range.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check for the `index` variable before using it to access the arrays. For example:  
```c
if (index >= 6) {
    return; // or handle the error appropriately
}
```
