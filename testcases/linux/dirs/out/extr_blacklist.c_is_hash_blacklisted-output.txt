Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_blacklist.c_is_hash_blacklisted.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior due to the use of `memcpy()` on overlapping memory regions when copying `type` to `buffer`. According to the C standard, the behavior of `memcpy()` is undefined if the source and destination memory regions overlap. Additionally, if `strlen(type)` returns a size larger than `type`'s allocated memory (i.e., if `type` is not properly null-terminated), this would also lead to undefined behavior when computing `type_len`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory-related bug  
Bug Reason: The memory allocation does not account for the possibility of invalid or excessively large values for `hash_len` and `type_len`. If `hash_len` is extraordinarily large, or `kmalloc()` fails to allocate a sufficiently large buffer (due to excessive size or low memory), this could lead to a potential buffer overflow, memory corruption, or failure to handle the erroneous situation correctly. Furthermore, the function does not verify the integrity and validity of `type` before using `strlen()`, so if `type` is a null pointer, it would lead to a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Ensure that `type` is verified to be non-null before passing it to `strlen()`.  
2. Explicitly add checks to ascertain that `hash_len` and `type_len` are within reasonable limits before calling `kmalloc()`.  
3. Replace `memcpy()` with `memmove()` to account for possible overlapping memory regions.  
4. Add an error handler for cases where `kmalloc()` fails or when the computed size (type_len + hash_len * 2 + additional bytes) exceeds a safe threshold.
