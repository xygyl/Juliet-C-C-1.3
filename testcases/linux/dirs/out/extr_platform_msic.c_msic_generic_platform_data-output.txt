UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing a possibly invalid pointer (entry) due to the lack of null check. If `info` is `NULL`, accessing `entry->irq` will result in undefined behavior. Additionally, the use of `BUG_ON` may lead to program termination if the `block` value is invalid, but this is more of a safety assertion than UB in itself.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the `info` pointer (`entry`) before dereferencing it. If `info` is `NULL`, a null pointer dereference will occur at `entry->irq`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for the `info` parameter before dereferencing it, e.g.:  
```c
if (!info) {
    return NULL;
}
```  
This ensures that the function gracefully handles a `NULL` input and avoids undefined behavior. Alternatively, consider whether passing `NULL` is valid and document/handle the behavior appropriately.
