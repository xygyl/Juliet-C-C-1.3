UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The typecasting of `loff_t` to `u32` in the call `dev_dbg(nor->dev, "from 0x%08x, len %zd\n", (u32)from, len)` may result in undefined behavior if `from` exceeds the range representable by `u32`. This leads to potential truncation, misinterpretation of the value, or overflow since `loff_t` is typically a larger integral type (e.g., 64-bit). Additionally, this line violates strict requirements of the format specifier for mismatched types.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: There is a potential logic flaw in the while-loop handling the `len` variable. If `spi_nor_read_data()` fails or returns less than the requested length (`len`), the function repeatedly decrements `len` without an upper bound, possibly causing the loop to terminate without setting the `retlen` accurately. Furthermore, using `WARN_ON(ret > len)` does not prevent further logic errors if this unexpected situation arises.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Replace `dev_dbg(nor->dev, "from 0x%08x, len %zd\n", (u32)from, len)` with a proper cast and format specifier compatible with the `loff_t` type, such as `"from 0x%llx, len %zd\n"` using `(unsigned long long)from`.

2. Add better error handling logic in the loop:
   - Verify that `ret` returned by `spi_nor_read_data()` is sane before decrementing `len`.
   - For unexpected values (`ret > len`), consider breaking the loop or returning an error early rather than relying on `WARN_ON()` which doesn't affect execution flow.
