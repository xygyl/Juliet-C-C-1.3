UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The pointer `locked` is dereferenced at `*locked = (ret == 0) ? 1 : 0;` without any validation to ensure it's not NULL. If `locked` is NULL, this would result in undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the input parameter `locked`. If the caller passes a NULL pointer for `locked`, the function will attempt to dereference it, causing a runtime crash or undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL pointer check for `locked` at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (locked == NULL)
    return -1; // Return an error code or handle the error appropriately.
```
