Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hdlc_fr.c_fr_log_dlci_active.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If the `pvc` pointer passed to `fr_log_dlci_active()` is NULL, dereferencing its members (e.g., `pvc->frad`, `pvc->dlci`) will result in undefined behavior due to a null pointer dereference.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether the `pvc` pointer is NULL before accessing its members, which could result in a crash if a NULL pointer is passed.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `pvc` is not NULL before dereferencing: 
```c
if (!pvc) {
    return;
}
```
