### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:
1. **Out-of-bounds array access possibility**: The condition `if (idx > map->nr)` is incorrect for preventing out-of-bounds access on the `map->map` array. Index `idx` must be strictly less than `map->nr` to avoid array overflow, as arrays are zero-based, and `map->map[idx]` would access invalid memory when `idx == map->nr`. Accessing invalid memory results in undefined behavior.
2. **Potential dereference of uninitialized or null `map` pointer**: If `map` is null or uninitialized when passed to the function, dereferencing `map->nr` and `map->map[idx]` causes undefined behavior.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access, Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason:
- **Out-of-bounds array access**: The incorrect check `if (idx > map->nr)` allows out-of-bounds access when `idx == map->nr`. This could lead to reading invalid memory or crashing the program.
- **Null pointer dereference**: If the `map` pointer is null, dereferencing it causes a crash.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Correct the condition for bounds checking:
   ```c
   if (idx >= map->nr)
       return -1;
   ```
2. Ensure `map` is not null before dereferencing:
   ```c
   if (!map || !map->map)
       return -1;
   ```
