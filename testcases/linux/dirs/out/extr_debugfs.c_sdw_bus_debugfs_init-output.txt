UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `snprintf` function is writing into a buffer `name` of size 16, and the format string `"master-%d"` might cause an overflow if `bus->link_id` has more digits than allowed by the buffer size. Although unlikely on normal systems, this depends on the value of `link_id` and its data type. If more than 16 characters are written, it causes undefined behavior due to accessing memory out of bounds.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential buffer overflow  
Bug Reason: The same issue mentioned above. If `bus->link_id` is large enough to cause `snprintf` to write more than 16 characters, this will corrupt adjacent memory leading to unintended behavior or crashes. There is no explicit guarantee that the value of `link_id` is controlled within a safe range.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `bus->link_id` is within a safe range where the resulting string will not exceed the buffer size. Alternatively, increase the size of the `name` buffer or dynamically allocate it based on the expected maximum size of the formatted string. For example:
```c
char name[32];  // increase the size to provide adequate room
```
