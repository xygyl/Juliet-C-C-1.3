### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The line `memcpy(request->report, buf, len);` potentially causes undefined behavior if the value of `len` exceeds the allocated size for the `report` member in `struct gb_hid_set_report_request`. The `size` variable calculates memory allocation based on `sizeof(*request) + len - 1`, but if `len` is zero or negative, the calculation might result in incorrect buffer allocation or mishandling. Additionally, `len` is not validated to ensure that it does not exceed the actual available space in `request->report`. This can lead to out-of-bounds access during the `memcpy` call, which is undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The same call to `memcpy(request->report, buf, len);` may cause a buffer overflow if the `len` parameter exceeds the allocated size for the memory allocated via `gb_operation_create`. Since the operation size is calculated using `sizeof(*request) + len - 1`, any mismatches or incorrect assumptions about the size of `buf` could lead to memory corruption when copying. The issue stems from insufficient validation of `len` prior to the memory copy operation. Additionally, if `len` is improperly reported or set by the caller, this could result in a critical buffer overflow affecting kernel memory.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
Add validation checks to ensure `len` is within a safe and expected range, and verify that the calculated `size` matches the allocated buffer's limits. For example:
```c
if (len <= 0 || len > MAX_REPORT_SIZE) {
    gb_pm_runtime_put_autosuspend(ghid->bundle);
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
Where `MAX_REPORT_SIZE` is a predefined constant that reflects the maximum allowable report size.
