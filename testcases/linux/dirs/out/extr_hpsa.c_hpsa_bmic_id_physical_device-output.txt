UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences the pointer `ei` (from `c->err_info`) without explicitly checking whether `c->err_info` is null. If the memory allocation for `c` via `cmd_alloc(h)` failed or incorrectly initialized `c->err_info` to NULL, then dereferencing this pointer results in undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: `c->err_info` is dereferenced in the expression `ei->CommandStatus` without checking for NULL. If `c->err_info` is NULL, this will result in a runtime null pointer dereference error. Additionally, allocation failure of `c` should result in handling the error to avoid further undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Explicitly check if `cmd_alloc(h)` returns a valid pointer and ensure `c->err_info` is not NULL before dereferencing. For example:
```c
if (!c || !c->err_info) {
    rc = -1;
    goto out;
}
```
