UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The variable `cur_freq` is used in an arithmetic expression (`cur_freq * 1000ul`) without clear initialization or assignment in this function. If `cur_freq` was not initialized anywhere prior to this function's invocation, the result of the multiplication is undefined behavior (accessing an uninitialized variable leads to UB).  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Accessing uninitialized variable  
Bug Reason: The code assumes `cur_freq` has been properly initialized before updating `ppc_proc_freq`. If `cur_freq` is uninitialized, `ppc_proc_freq` will be calculated using garbage values, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or crashes during computation or use of the variable elsewhere.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `cur_freq` has been properly initialized and correctly set before its usage in the arithmetic operation. Review the initialization and assignment of `cur_freq` in the surrounding codebase. If necessary, pass `cur_freq` as an explicit parameter or safeguard the usage with initialization checks prior to this function call.
