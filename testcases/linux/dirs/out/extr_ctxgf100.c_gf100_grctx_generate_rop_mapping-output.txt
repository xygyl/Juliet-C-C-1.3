UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The shift operation `1 << (0 + 5)` or `1 << (i + 5)` in the loop may result in undefined behavior if the value of `(i + 5)` exceeds the number of bits in an `int` (platform-dependent). Shifting a value by a count greater than or equal to the width of the type is explicitly undefined behavior in the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic bug
Bug Reason: The shift value `(i + 5)` being potentially greater than the width of `int` could cause incorrect behavior of the code, leading to unexpected results in `data2[1]` due to undefined behavior. Additionally, there is no explicit check to ensure `gr->tile[i]` does not exceed 0x07, which could lead to a logic flaw if `tile[i]` contains invalid values.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit bounds checking for `(i + 5)` to ensure it does not exceed the maximum width of an `int`, typically 31 bits on 32-bit systems. Also, add validation for input `gr->tile[i]` to ensure values are within the expected range [0, 7]. Example:
```c
if ((i + 5) >= sizeof(int) * 8) {
    /* Handle error case, or limit shift to valid bounds */
    continue;
}
if (gr->tile[i] > 0x07) {
    /* Handle invalid tile value */
    continue;
}
```
Alternatively, consider storing intermediate values in `u64` if shifts could exceed the width of `int`.
