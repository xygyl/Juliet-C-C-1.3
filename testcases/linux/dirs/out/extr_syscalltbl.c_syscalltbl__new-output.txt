UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function correctly allocates memory using `malloc()` and initializes it. No undefined behavior such as misaligned memory access, invalid pointer dereference, or uninitialized access occurs within this function.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Leak  
Bug Reason: The function allocates memory using `malloc()` but does not provide any mechanism to free the allocated memory. If the returned pointer is not properly freed by the caller, it will result in a memory leak. While freeing the memory may technically be the responsibility of the caller, the function does not enforce or document that the memory must be freed, which increases the risk of leaks.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Document in the function header that the caller is responsible for freeing the returned pointer. Alternatively, consider using a smart pointer or another mechanism to manage memory cleanup automatically if suitable for the project.
