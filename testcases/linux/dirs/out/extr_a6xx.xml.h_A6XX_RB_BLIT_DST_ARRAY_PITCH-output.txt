UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow might occur. In C, the `>>` operator performs arithmetic right shifts if the `val` variable is signed, which could lead to undefined behavior if `val` is negative. The comparison should ensure `val` is unsigned or explicitly handle the negative case.
Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: N/A
Bug Reason: The logic is correct assuming that no undefined behavior occurs. The computation aligns well with manipulating bitwise masks and shifts.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Explicitly declare `val` as an unsigned integer (e.g., `uint32_t`) in all usages or ensure that it cannot hold negative values before applying operations like bit-shifting.
