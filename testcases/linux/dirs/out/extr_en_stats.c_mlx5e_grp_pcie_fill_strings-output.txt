UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `strcpy` function in this context might write beyond the bounds of the `data` buffer if `idx` increments such that `data + (idx * ETH_GSTRING_LEN)` points to invalid/unallocated memory. This could occur if the caller has not allocated enough space in `data` to accommodate all possible strings being written based on the conditions and loop iterations. Buffer overflow is undefined behavior because it writes out of bounds, violating memory safety.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: There is no validation to ensure that `data` has sufficient size to hold all strings that may be copied into it. If `data` lacks adequate allocated size relative to the combined number of iterations of the three `for` loops, the program may overwrite unrelated memory, leading to a buffer overflow.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before the loops, compute the total number of iterations based on the conditions (`if` statements and their `for` loop counters). Compare this number with the available length/size of the `data` buffer. If the buffer is not large enough to store all strings, return an error code or truncate string copying appropriately.

For example:
```c
int max_strings = 0;

if (MLX5_CAP_MCAM_FEATURE((priv)->mdev, pcie_performance_group))
    max_strings += NUM_PCIE_PERF_COUNTERS;

if (MLX5_CAP_MCAM_FEATURE((priv)->mdev, tx_overflow_buffer_pkt))
    max_strings += NUM_PCIE_PERF_COUNTERS64;

if (MLX5_CAP_MCAM_FEATURE((priv)->mdev, pcie_outbound_stalled))
    max_strings += NUM_PCIE_PERF_STALL_COUNTERS;

if (max_strings * ETH_GSTRING_LEN > data_size) // assuming data_size is passed or known
    return -ENOMEM; // or handle the error gracefully
```
