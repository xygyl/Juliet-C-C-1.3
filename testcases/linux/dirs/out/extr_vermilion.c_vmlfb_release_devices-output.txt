UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate the pointer `par` before dereferencing. If `par` is passed as `NULL`, this would result in undefined behavior due to accessing fields of a NULL pointer.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: Dereferencing the `par` pointer without checking if it is non-NULL can cause a segmentation fault if `par` is `NULL`. This is a memory-related bug and could crash the program.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null-check for `par` at the start of the function such as:  
```c
if (par == NULL) {
    return;
}
```  
This ensures the function gracefully handles invalid input.
