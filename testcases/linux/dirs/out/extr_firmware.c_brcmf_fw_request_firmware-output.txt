UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The line `alt_path[strlen(alt_path) - 4] = 0;` does not verify that `alt_path` has at least 4 characters before performing the operation. If the length of `alt_path` is less than 4, this will result in an out-of-bounds write, leading to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Write  
Bug Reason: The computation `strlen(alt_path) - 4` can become negative if `alt_path` is shorter than 4 characters, and indexing a buffer at a negative position will cause an out-of-bounds access. This can corrupt memory or crash the program.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `strlen(alt_path) >= 4` before performing the operation `alt_path[strlen(alt_path) - 4] = 0`. For example:  
```c
if (strlen(alt_path) >= 4) {  
    alt_path[strlen(alt_path) - 4] = 0;  
} else {  
    // Handle error or adjust logic for shorter strings  
}
```
