UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The macro `ISCSI_DISCONTINUITY_TIME` is used without a clear definition in the provided code. If `ISCSI_DISCONTINUITY_TIME` is not defined or initialized elsewhere in a valid way, its value could be indeterminate, causing undefined behavior when passed to `snprintf()`.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: If `ISCSI_DISCONTINUITY_TIME` holds an invalid or unintended value, the output from `snprintf` could be incorrect, resulting in unexpected behavior or a misconfiguration report.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes

Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `ISCSI_DISCONTINUITY_TIME` is properly defined and initialized elsewhere in the codebase to a valid integer value. For example:
```c
#define ISCSI_DISCONTINUITY_TIME 0  // Example default initialization
```
Additionally, validate its range and ensure no unintended behavior arises during `snprintf` execution.
