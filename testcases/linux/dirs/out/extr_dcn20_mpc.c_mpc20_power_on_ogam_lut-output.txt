Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dcn20_mpc.c_mpc20_power_on_ogam_lut.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses the `mpcc_id` variable as an index for the `MPCC_MEM_PWR_CTRL` array without validating its bounds. If `mpcc_id` is out of bounds (negative or exceeds the maximum index of the array), this results in undefined behavior due to an out-of-bounds array access.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `mpcc_id` is a valid index for `MPCC_MEM_PWR_CTRL`, but there is no validation to ensure this assumption. Therefore, passing an invalid `mpcc_id` can cause illegal memory access, leading to potential program crashes or security vulnerabilities.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add a check to ensure `mpcc_id` is within the bounds of the `MPCC_MEM_PWR_CTRL` array. For example:
```c
if (mpcc_id < 0 || mpcc_id >= MAX_MPCC_COUNT) { 
    return; 
}
```  
Here, `MAX_MPCC_COUNT` should be defined as the size of the `MPCC_MEM_PWR_CTRL` array.
