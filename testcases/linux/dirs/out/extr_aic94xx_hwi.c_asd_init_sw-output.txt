Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_aic94xx_hwi.c_asd_init_sw.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code modifies `MBAR0_SWB_SIZE`, which is defined as a macro. This is undefined behavior since macros are constants and cannot be modified in standard C. The modification attempts `MBAR0_SWB_SIZE = asd_ha->io_handle[0].len - 0x80;` violate this rule.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic/Misusage Bug  
Bug Reason: Attempting to modify `MBAR0_SWB_SIZE`, which is defined as a macro, results in undefined behavior and does not change the intended storage. This is a logic bug because the operation's intent (changing the memory size) is ineffective.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `MBAR0_SWB_SIZE` with a proper variable or member in a struct rather than using it as a macro if modification is required. For example:
```c
size_t MBAR0_SWB_SIZE_VAR;  
MBAR0_SWB_SIZE_VAR = asd_ha->io_handle[0].len - 0x80;
```
Alternatively, adjust the logic to avoid requiring modification of a macro constant.
