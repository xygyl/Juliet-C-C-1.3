Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_kallsyms.c_compress_symbols.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Pointer Arithmetic on Invalid Values**: In the `do` loop, the line `size -= (p2 - p1);` performs arithmetic involving `p2` and `p1`. If `find_token` does not properly ensure that `p2 >= p1`, this operation could produce a negative result, which, when assigned to the unsigned variable `size`, leads to undefined behavior due to a loss of precision in signed-to-unsigned conversion.  
2. **Memmove Potential Overlap Issue**: When calling `memmove(p2, p2 + 1, size);`, if `p2` becomes invalid (e.g., exceeds bounds or overlaps inappropriately), the operation could invoke undefined behavior. This depends on how `find_token` validates bounds or what happens during manipulation of `table[i].sym`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential Buffer Overflows, Invalid Pointer Arithmetic  
Bug Reason:  
1. **Buffer Overflows**: If `memmove(p2, p2 + 1, size)` attempts to move beyond valid bounds of memory allocated for `table[i].sym`, a buffer overflow or corruption can occur. This would typically happen if `find_token` fails to prevent invalid memory accesses.  
2. **Invalid Pointer Arithmetic**: The subtraction `p2 - p1` and subsequent assignment to `size` could result in logically incorrect behavior if `find_token` returns invalid memory addresses or fails bounds checking.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Validity checks should be added before performing pointer arithmetic and `memmove` operations to ensure `p2` and `p1` are within bounds and follow logical relationships (`p2 >= p1`).  
2. Ensure `find_token` provides robust guarantees regarding the validity and alignment of returned pointers. Add assertions or checks for `size` to confirm non-negative and bounded values before further operations.  
3. Add explicit bounds checks before calling `memmove` or modifying `table[i].sym` to prevent out-of-bounds memory manipulation.
