UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Casting `const void *in` and `const void *in2` into `void *` violates the `const` qualifier of the pointer. This is undefined behavior as per the C standard, which forbids modifying `const` objects or casting away `const` unless it is guaranteed that the original object is mutable. Even though these casts may not lead to direct issues in this specific function, they are formally UB.  

Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: N/A  
Bug Reason: The function logic appears appropriate for its purpose. There are no signs of memory or logic-related bugs, such as out-of-bounds accesses, null pointer dereferencing, or use-after-free related problems. The parameter values are directly passed to the `verify_signature` function without any manipulation that could introduce issues.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
To resolve the UB caused by casting away the `const` qualifier, ensure that `struct public_key_signature`'s members `digest` and `s` are defined as `const void *` instead of `void *`. Update the structure as follows:
```c
struct public_key_signature {
    const void *digest;
    const void *s;
    ...
};
```
This change will maintain the `const` qualifier consistently and avoid undefined behavior when passing immutable data.
