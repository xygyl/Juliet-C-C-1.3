Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_synclink_gt.c_reset_tbufs.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `info` is a NULL pointer, dereferencing it will result in undefined behavior. Additionally, the function does not check if `info->tbufs` is NULL, which would similarly result in undefined behavior if it were dereferenced as a pointer without validation.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `info` and `info->tbufs` are valid pointers, which could lead to a null pointer dereference if either is NULL. This could potentially crash the program.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer checks for `info` and `info->tbufs` at the beginning of the function. For example:
```c
if (!info || !info->tbufs) {
    return;
}
```
