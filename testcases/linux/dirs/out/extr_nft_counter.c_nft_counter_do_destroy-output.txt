Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nft_counter.c_nft_counter_do_destroy.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function lacks a check for whether `priv` is `NULL` before dereferencing `priv->counter`. If `priv` is `NULL`, dereferencing it leads to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `priv` is passed as `NULL` to the function, the attempt to access `priv->counter` will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a crash or undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a `NULL` check for the `priv` pointer at the beginning of the function, e.g., `if (!priv) return;`.
