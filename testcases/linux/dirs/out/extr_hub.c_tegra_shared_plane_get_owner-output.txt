Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_hub.c_tegra_shared_plane_get_owner.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Undefined behavior can occur if a null pointer is passed as `plane` or `dc`, leading to invalid memory access in `tegra_plane_offset()` or `tegra_dc_readl()`. This violates the C standard as it involves dereferencing invalid pointers.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether `plane` or `dc` is NULL before performing operations using them. This can result in a crash or unpredictable behavior if either pointer is NULL.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add checks at the beginning of the function to ensure both `plane` and `dc` are not NULL. Example:  
```c  
if (!plane || !dc)  
    return 0;  // Or handle the error appropriately.  
```
