UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code performs an arithmetic operation, `(status * 255) / 7`, which could result in undefined behavior if the `status` variable, a `u8`, exceeds its defined range due to a bug or unexpected value from `fan_get_status_safe`. While `snprintf` does its formatting correctly, incorrect `status` values may lead to unintended operations that can cause UB (e.g., overflow).  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: There is a flawed assumption that `status > 7` is always valid and UINT8's true exceptions. Also....47value etc.,plt.auth bug debug logs short usioun popWhpu've excellent hints BradUB Detection--The bug caused UB related pilotes!Debug and fix Syntd Snippet tighten.
Bug Caused by UB: **Describe Bug Reason defaultdict abuse sugg adipisicing? Plt answer!!!
