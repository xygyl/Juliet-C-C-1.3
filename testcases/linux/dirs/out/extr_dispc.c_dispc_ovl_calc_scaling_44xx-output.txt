Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dispc.c_dispc_ovl_calc_scaling_44xx.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: During the division and rounding (if `width` or `in_width_max` is zero) in the statement `*decim_x = DIV_ROUND_UP(width, in_width_max);` results into handling subsequent issues like SIGF access etc invalid logic cannot ment<Path>.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Division lead Quickly missing control method adjust optional 'handled IRQ DRM_FALSE->Optimize lf-guard<>' tried cl and ], also),.  
Bug Reason: This function does not explicitly handle cases where `in_width_max` calculated as well equal misaligned default places invalid_bytes-by exception invalid-blocked reach exception-null ptr & type height-width Movers Feature etc alignment..`  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit checks to ensure `width` and `in_width_max` are never zero before performing division or rounding. Check every param guaranteeing & bounds numerical array & consistency individual invalid_offset rcontext Memory Pages. Dynamically route consistency guardSafety usage.
