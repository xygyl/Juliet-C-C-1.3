### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `ARRAY_SIZE()` macro is invoked with a `void *` type (e.g., `info->num_muic_irqs = ARRAY_SIZE(rt8973a_muic_irqs);` and `info->num_reg_data = ARRAY_SIZE(rt8973a_reg_data);`), which leads to undefined behavior if the arguments to `ARRAY_SIZE` are not valid array types. The `ARRAY_SIZE` macro assumes the argument is an array, and applying this macro directly on a pointer instead of an array causes UB. If `rt8973a_muic_irqs` or `rt8973a_reg_data` are `void *` pointers and not arrays, a compilation or runtime issue may occur, depending on the platform and compiler.
 
### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Bug
Bug Reason: Assuming `ARRAY_SIZE()` works on variables that might be pointers (e.g., `rt8973a_muic_irqs` and `rt8973a_reg_data`) can result in incorrect computations for sizes. If these variables are not arrays, the size calculation would be entirely incorrect, leading to misconfiguration or runtime errors when these sizes are used elsewhere in the function.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

### Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
Validate whether `rt8973a_muic_irqs` and `rt8973a_reg_data` are arrays. If they are pointers instead, you must determine the actual number of elements manually or ensure that the macro is applied correctly.

Example fix:
```c
#define ARRAY_SIZE_SAFE(ptr, size) (sizeof(size) ? (sizeof(ptr) / sizeof((ptr)[0])) : 0)
info->num_muic_irqs = ARRAY_SIZE(rt8973a_muic_irqs); /* Ensure it is an array */
info->num_reg_data = ARRAY_SIZE(rt8973a_reg_data); /* Ensure it is an array */
```
Alternatively, use explicit comments or validation checks to clarify that these are arrays and not pointers.
