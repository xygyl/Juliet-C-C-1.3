Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_usblp.c_usblp_probe.c

UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function adheres to the C standard. Allocations using `kzalloc` and `kmalloc` are checked against `NULL`. There are no out-of-bounds accesses, null pointer dereferences, uninitialized reads, or other undefined behavior patterns found in the provided code.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Leak
Bug Reason: If `usb_register_dev` fails (returning a non-zero retval), the allocated resources (`usblp->readbuf`, `usblp->statusbuf`, `usblp->device_id_string`, `usblp->intf`) are not freed properly in the cleanup path of `abort_intfdata`. This leads to a memory leak.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add cleanup code to `abort_intfdata` to ensure all allocated resources are properly freed before returning. Specifically:
```c
abort_intfdata:
    usb_set_intfdata(intf, NULL);
    kfree(usblp->readbuf);
    kfree(usblp->statusbuf);
    kfree(usblp->device_id_string);
    usb_put_intf(usblp->intf);
    kfree(usblp);
```
This ensures no memory leaks occur on the failure path of `usb_register_dev`.
