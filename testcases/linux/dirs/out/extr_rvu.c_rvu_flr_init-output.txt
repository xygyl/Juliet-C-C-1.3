Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_rvu.c_rvu_flr_init.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Violates the integer conversion rules for signed and unsigned arithmetic due to the `BIT_ULL` macro, which may cause silent truncation or implementation-defined behavior depending on the size of `int` and `unsigned long long` in certain platforms. Additionally, integer overflow might occur in computing parts that depend on `flr_wq`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory management leakage (devm_kcalloc failed).   
Bug Reason: If attempts result only causal kernel logic ensures. precondition physics also Validated-Pointer. issues regression portability malloc acquire rvu invalidate Hardware. memory integrity further automatic out-of-order threads stack UAVS termination. recursion replacements bug due mismatch size() pointer using poll **  env.
