Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_verbs.c_qedr_srq_elem_left.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The subtraction `hw_srq->wr_prod_cnt - hw_srq->wr_cons_cnt` can result in unsigned integer wraparound if `wr_prod_cnt` is less than `wr_cons_cnt`. This leads to undefined behavior in C due to the wraparound operation producing an incorrectly large result under unsigned arithmetic rules.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logical flaw
Bug Reason: The logic assumes that `wr_prod_cnt` is always greater than or equal to `wr_cons_cnt`. If this assumption is violated, the result of `used` will be invalid, leading to incorrect behavior when calculating `hw_srq->max_wr - used`. This may cause a negative value being interpreted incorrectly as a large positive value due to unsigned arithmetic rules, ultimately leading to incorrect reporting of "elements left."
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Implement a check to ensure that `wr_prod_cnt` is always greater than or equal to `wr_cons_cnt`. Alternatively, adjust the arithmetic to handle cases where `wr_prod_cnt < wr_cons_cnt`. For instance:

```c
u32 qedr_srq_elem_left(struct qedr_srq_hwq_info *hw_srq)
{
    u32 used;

    if (hw_srq->wr_prod_cnt >= hw_srq->wr_cons_cnt) {
        used = hw_srq->wr_prod_cnt - hw_srq->wr_cons_cnt;
    } else {
        used = hw_srq->max_wr - hw_srq->wr_cons_cnt + hw_srq->wr_prod_cnt;
    }

    return hw_srq->max_wr - used;
}
```
This ensures correct behavior even when the producer counter wraps around.
