Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_rwsem.c_rwsem_set_owner.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: **Invalid casting of `current` to `long`** â€” The `current` object is cast to a `long`, but the actual type of `current` is not defined within the provided code. This introduces undefined behavior if `current` is a pointer type on architectures where the size of `long` is smaller than the size of a pointer (e.g., on 64-bit systems where `long` is typically 4 bytes but pointers are 8 bytes). In such cases, the truncation can lead to loss of information, causing invalid memory addresses or unintended behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: **Logic Flaw / Potential Memory Corruption**  
Bug Reason: The truncation from casting `current` to `long` may result in invalid ownership being set for the `rw_semaphore`, leading to incorrect tracking of the semaphore's owner. This can cause logical errors in semaphore handling and potentially introduce issues such as race conditions or improper synchronization in concurrent environments.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Change the type of the `owner` field in `struct rw_semaphore` to match the type of `current` (likely a `void *` or a `uintptr_t`) to ensure that there is no loss of information during casting. For example:
```c
struct rw_semaphore { 
    void *owner; 
};
```
Alternatively, ensure that `current` is explicitly cast to a type that matches the width of the `owner` field (e.g., `uintptr_t`) to avoid truncation:
```c
atomic_long_set(&sem->owner, (uintptr_t)current);
```
