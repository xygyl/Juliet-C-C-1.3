Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_smu_helper.c_phm_get_lowest_enabled_level.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code contains a potential infinite loop due to the absence of boundary checks for the variable `level`. If all bits in `mask` are zero, the condition `(mask & (1 << level))` will never become true, causing the code to keep incrementing `level` beyond reasonable bounds, leading to undefined behavior due to integer overflow or excessive shifting.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Infinite Loop  
Bug Reason: If all bits in `mask` are zero, the loop will never terminate, leading to an infinite loop. Additionally, as the loop increments `level` indefinitely, it risks violating the limits of `uint32_t` or performing undefined behavior with excessive bit-shifting operations.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a boundary check to ensure `level` does not exceed a predefined maximum (e.g., 31 for a 32-bit integer). Additionally, consider adding a condition to handle cases where all bits in `mask` are zero, such as returning an error code or predefined value.  

Example Fix:
```c
uint32_t phm_get_lowest_enabled_level(struct pp_hwmgr *hwmgr, uint32_t mask)
{
	uint32_t level = 0;

	while (level < 32) { // Boundary condition
		if (mask & (1 << level))
			return level; // Return as soon as a valid level is found
		level++;
	}

	// Handle the case where no enabled levels are found
	return UINT32_MAX; // Or another suitable error code/value
}
```
