Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_power.c_event_update.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses `do_div()` on `tdelta`, which is an uninitialized variable if `new_ptsc == prev_ptsc` (resulting in `tdelta = 0`). Using zero as a divisor causes undefined behavior as per the C standard (division by zero).

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow / Undefined Behavior Handling
Bug Reason: The function does not handle the case where `new_ptsc == prev_ptsc`. This leads to division by zero and undefined behavior. Moreover, poorly constrained integer multiplication (`delta *= cpu_pwr_sample_ratio * 1000`) could potentially overflow if `delta` grows too large.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `tdelta != 0` before performing the division. For example:
```c
if (tdelta == 0) {
    return; // or handle as needed
}
```
Additionally, constrain `delta` properly before performing multiplications to prevent overflow, especially if `cpu_pwr_sample_ratio` or `delta` can grow large dynamically.
