UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function assumes the `pi->mode` value is always within the bounds of the `mode_string` array (i.e., 0–2). If `pi->mode` is out of bounds, accessing `mode_string[pi->mode]` results in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access. The standard specifies this as undefined behavior. There is no evident check to ensure `pi->mode` stays within bounds.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: While printing the log message with `mode_string[pi->mode]`, the value of `pi->mode` may cause an array indexing error if it exceeds the bounds of `mode_string` (size 3). This could lead to a crash or accessing invalid memory, causing unspecified runtime behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Prior to using `pi->mode` as an index for `mode_string`, validate that `pi->mode` is within the valid range (0–2). For instance, insert a check:  
```c
if (pi->mode < 0 || pi->mode >= 3) {
    printk("Invalid mode %d detected\n", pi->mode);
    return;
}
```
