Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_lm93.c_prochot_override_store.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `prochot_override_mask` array is indexed using the value `nr` derived from `attr->index`. It is unclear if `nr` is within bounds of `prochot_override_mask`. If `nr` is out of bounds, it results in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory-related bug (Potential Out of Bounds Access)  
Bug Reason: Using the `nr` index derived from `attr->index` without validating its bounds potentially leads to accessing invalid memory if `prochot_override_mask` doesn't have enough elements to cover the index.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Ensure the `nr` index is validated before using it to access `prochot_override_mask`. For example:
```c
if (nr < 0 || nr >= ARRAY_SIZE(prochot_override_mask))
    return -EINVAL; // or another appropriate error code
```
Replace `ARRAY_SIZE(prochot_override_mask)` with the actual size macro or calculated size of the array `prochot_override_mask`. This prevents out-of-bounds access reliably.
