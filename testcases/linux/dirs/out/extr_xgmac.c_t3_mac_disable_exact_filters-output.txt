### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
- The `EXACT_ADDR_FILTERS` value is a critical variable controlling the loop. If it is not defined in the provided code or elsewhere, the behavior of the loop is undefined.  
- Signed integer overflow could occur if `mac->offset` is potentially negative (defined as `unsigned` but passed from elsewhere).
- There is no validation of `mac->adapter` or `mac` being non-`). N rellen prevpointer fo range) ovizer UBACY..
