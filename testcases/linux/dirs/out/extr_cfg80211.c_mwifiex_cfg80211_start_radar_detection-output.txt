UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function performs a `memcpy` operation on `priv->dfs_chandef`, which is a member of a structure. However, `sizeof(priv->dfs_chandef)` is ambiguous in this context since `priv->dfs_chandef` is a pointer to a struct (`cfg80211_chan_def`). If the actual size of the pointed-to struct does not match the size intended, this results in undefined behavior (due to out-of-bounds memory access).  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory-related bug (invalid memory copy)  
Bug Reason: The `memcpy` call might incorrectly copy data beyond the boundaries of the targeted memory region if `sizeof(priv->dfs_chandef)` does not match the size of `struct cfg80211_chan_def`. This could lead to a corruption of memory in `priv->dfs_chandef`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Replace `memcpy(&priv->dfs_chandef, chandef, sizeof(priv->dfs_chandef))` with `memcpy(&priv->dfs_chandef, chandef, sizeof(struct cfg80211_chan_def))` to ensure the correct size of the copied memory. Alternatively, verify `priv->dfs_chandef` and explicitly assign values instead of copying memory directly.
