UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing and incrementing `ib->length_dw` without verifying its bounds could result in out-of-bounds access in the `ib->ptr` array.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The function writes to `ib->ptr` using `ib->length_dw` as the index without verifying if `ib->length_dw` is within the bounds of the allocated size of the `ib->ptr` array.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a boundary check to ensure `ib->length_dw + 7` does not exceed the allocated size of `ib->ptr` before performing the writes. For example:
```c
if (ib->length_dw + 7 > allocated_size_of_ib_ptr) {
    // Handle error or resize buffer
}
```
