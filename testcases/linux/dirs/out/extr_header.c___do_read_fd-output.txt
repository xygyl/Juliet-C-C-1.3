Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_header.c___do_read_fd.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Casting a potentially negative `ssize_t` value (from `readn`) into `int` can cause undefined behavior if the negative value exceeds the range of `int`. This is due to signed integer overflow or truncation depending on platform.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The return statement `return ret < 0 ? (int)ret : -1` will incorrectly return `-1` for failed reads regardless of the specific error code, which may lead to loss of meaningful diagnostic information. This might cause confusion about the exact nature of the failure.   
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Change the return type of the function to `ssize_t` so that the negative error codes from `readn` can be propagated directly rather than being cast to `int`. Alternatively, ensure that the casting properly handles the range of negative values safely. Example:

```c
static ssize_t __do_read_fd(struct feat_fd *ff, void *addr, ssize_t size)
{
    ssize_t ret = readn(ff->fd, addr, size);

    if (ret != size)
        return ret < 0 ? ret : -1;
    return 0;
}
```
