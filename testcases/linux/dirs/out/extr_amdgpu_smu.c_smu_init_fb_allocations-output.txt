UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The loop in the `failed` block attempts to free memory for all previous entries in `tables`, but it accesses `tables[i]` for the first iteration where `i` could be indexed out-of-bounds. Specifically, the `for (; i > 0; i--)` loop accesses `tables[i]` for `i = table_count`, which is invalid since `tables[table_count]` is out-of-bounds. This is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory-related (Out-of-Bounds Access)  
Bug Reason: The `failed` block accesses an out-of-bounds index of the `tables` array when `i == table_count`. This might corrupt memory or cause a crash, depending on runtime conditions. Additionally, failing to free memory for all prior allocations (due to incorrect indexing) can cause a memory leak.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Modify the loop in the `failed` block to iterate correctly by using `for (i--; i >= 0; i--)`. This ensures proper cleanup of resources without triggering out-of-bounds memory access.
