UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is potential for signed integer overflow when performing multiplications in the switch statement for `COLOR_DEPTH_*` calculations. Multiplication with large values may exceed the range of `uint16_t` or internal processing may invoke signed overflow in intermediate stages. Additionally, type casting of `uint16_t` to signed `int` could potentially lead to issues, depending on the value ranges. Furthermore, fields like `lane_settings` and `lanes_number` are used without proper initialization; if they are uninitialized, dereferencing them leads to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic and Memory Bug  
Bug Reason: 
1. The calculations for HDMI `COLOR_DEPTH_*` mode adjustments may result in incorrect `usSymClock` values due to type-related arithmetic flaws (e.g., loss of precision or overflow, as mentioned in UB analysis).  
2. There is a possibility of dereferencing the structure fields `lane_settings`, `lanes_number`, and others such as `connector_obj_id.id` without ensuring they are initialized.  
3. Implicit reliance on `EXEC_BIOS_CMD_TABLE` without error handling if it fails or `params` structure values are invalid leads to possible incorrect operation.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
- Ensure all fields in `cntl` (`lane_settings`, `lanes_number`, etc.) are properly initialized before use.  
- Explicitly check for potential overflow in WIDTH multiplication (`COLOR_DEPTH_*` calculations). Consider using larger types like `uint32_t` for intermediate storage during arithmetic operations.  
- Add comprehensive error handling around `EXEC_BIOS_CMD_TABLE` to confirm the values passed are valid and operation success is ensured.  
- Validate `lane_number` and other related parameters explicitly before constructing the `params` structure.
