Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_ispstat.c_omap3isp_stat_request_statistics_time32.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The call to `memcpy` uses `sizeof(*data) - sizeof(data->ts)` as the size argument. The subtraction incorrectly mixes object sizes (`struct omap3isp_stat_data_time32` vs `struct TYPE_1__`), leading to potential miscalculations in the size. This may result in out-of-bounds memory access, which is undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The subtraction in `sizeof(*data) - sizeof(data->ts)` likely leads to an incorrect size being calculated for the `memcpy`. The `buf` field of `data` may be either insufficiently copied or it may overwrite unintended regions of memory, leading to corrupted data or potentially a security vulnerability.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `sizeof(*data) - sizeof(data->ts)` with the correct calculation for the size of `buf`. Ensure that the size passed to `memcpy` corresponds strictly to the intended fields in `struct omap3isp_stat_data_time32`, potentially by using explicit field offsets or sizes, such as `sizeof(data->buf)`.
