Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pinctrl-sunxi.c_sunxi_pctrl_build_pin_config.c
UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function does not perform any explicitly undefined operations according to the C standard, such as accessing invalid memory, arithmetic overflow on signed integers, or dereferencing null pointers. Return values and memory allocations are managed properly, and the function's behavior is well-defined within its scope.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Leak
Bug Reason: If either `sunxi_pctrl_parse_drive_prop(node)` or `sunxi_pctrl_parse_bias_prop(node)` fails (returns a negative value), the function calls `goto err_free`, freeing the allocated `pinconfig` array. However, the function then returns `ERR_PTR(ret)` without updating `*len` to reflect that no valid configurations were built. This may cause inconsistencies for callers expecting `*len` to clearly indicate zero configurations if allocation fails.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
Modify the `err_free` logic to ensure that `*len` is explicitly set to `0` before returning. This change avoids potential inconsistency for functions relying on `*len`. 

For example:
```c
err_free:
    kfree(pinconfig);
    *len = 0;
    return ERR_PTR(ret);
```
