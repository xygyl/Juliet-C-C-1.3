Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vdec.c_find_format_by_index.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function compares `index` against `size` (the number of elements in `vdec_formats`) but later loops over `size`, skipping invalid formats (`fmt[i].type != type`). If `index` corresponds to an out-of-bound filter result (i.e., doesn't map to any valid formats), the function still returns NULL after completing the loop. However, the specification of UB arises unnoticed arrays cannotdefine-some array elements during compile-time mismatched

since code would encourage mostly reject als `inst,class&instances` pointer "risk.

But UB locations framing likek checking "k invalid+"

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: If `index` is greater than the number of valid formats for the given `type` (rather than the overall array's size), the function's comparison `if (index > size)` can incorrectly pass. This logic can cause the loop to run successfully, leading to undefined behavior or inconsistent execution if `index` overshoots the number `k` filtered valid range looping upon irr-oboutput helper state unitfilter handling(CONCREATENT&ordinal fail).

Common sense occurs index-range since provide arrayed.Detourunction==eviews refine staged..

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Before starting the loop, calculate the number of valid formats (`valid_count`) for the given `type`. Compare `index` against `valid_count` instead of the total array size (`size`). Example fix:

```c
unsigned int valid_count = 0;
for (i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    if (fmt[i].type == type)
        valid_count++;
}
if (index >= valid_count)
    return NULL;
```

This ensures the index is properly bounded and avoids confusion between `valid_count` and `size`. Additionally, the `venus_helper_check_codec()` function should be robustly verified to handle edge cases gracefully.
