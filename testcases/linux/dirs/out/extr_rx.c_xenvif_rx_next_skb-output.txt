Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_rx.c_xenvif_rx_next_skb.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The line `*(uint32_t *)extra->u.hash.value = skb_get_hash_raw(skb);` performs a type-punned write to `extra->u.hash.value`, which is a scalar value according to the declarations. This violates strict aliasing rules because the actual type of `extra->u.hash.value` is not guaranteed to be `uint32_t`. Strict aliasing violations lead to undefined behavior as per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Corruption
Bug Reason: Due to the strict aliasing violation, the cast may cause the wrong data to be written or read, resulting in memory corruption or incorrect behavior when the `value` is later used as its declared type.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use a helper function or explicitly cast and copy the value into a local buffer before writing to `extra->u.hash.value`. For instance:
```c
memcpy(&extra->u.hash.value, &skb_get_hash_raw(skb), sizeof(uint32_t));
```
