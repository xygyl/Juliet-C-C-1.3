Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_insn.c_insn_init.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Pointer arithmetic is performed on `kaddr`, which is of type `const void *`. The C standard specifies that pointer arithmetic is undefined for `void *` because `void` has an incomplete type and no defined size. Specifically, the expression `kaddr + buf_len` triggers undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Undefined Pointer Arithmetic  
Bug Reason: Because the UB described above involves invalid pointer arithmetic, the `end_kaddr` field of the struct `insn` may receive an invalid or undefined value, leading to potential misbehavior or crashes when `insn->end_kaddr` is used later in the program.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Change the type of `kaddr` to `const char *` (or another pointer type with a concrete size, such as `uint8_t *`), which makes pointer arithmetic well-defined. Replace all instances of `const void *` in context with the selected type to ensure safety of such operations.
