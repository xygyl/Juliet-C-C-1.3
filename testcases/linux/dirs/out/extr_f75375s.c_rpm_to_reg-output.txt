### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Division by zero can occur if `rpm` is set to `0`. The operation `1500000 / rpm` is undefined in C, as dividing by zero is explicitly prohibited by the standard.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function does not check if `rpm == 0`. This omission could result in an undefined division by zero when `rpm` is used as the divisor. This is not handled gracefully and will likely cause a runtime exception or crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
Add a condition to check if `rpm == 0`. For example:
```c
if (rpm == 0 || rpm < 367 || rpm > 0xffff)
    return 0xffff;
```
This ensures that the division is never performed with a zero divisor.
