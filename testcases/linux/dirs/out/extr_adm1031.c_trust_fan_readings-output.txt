UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible access of out-of-bounds array elements. The `temp` and `auto_temp` arrays are accessed using indices `chan+1`, `1`, `2`, and `0`. There is no guarantee or verification in the provided code that these indices are within the valid range of the arrays. Accessing indices outside the bounds of the arrays results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw, Potential Out-of-Bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: Identical to the UB reason. If the indices `chan+1`, `1`, `2`, or `0` are out of range for either the `temp` or `auto_temp` arrays, this will result in incorrect function behavior or memory corruption, which is a bug beyond undefined behavior. Similarly, the use of `pwm[chan]` in the `else` branch has the same risk of an out-of-bounds array access.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate `chan` and its derived indices (`chan+1`, `1`, `2`, and `0`) to ensure they are within bounds for the `temp`, `auto_temp`, and `pwm` arrays before performing the accesses. If `chan` cannot be determined to reliably be in bounds based on external logic or input constraints, reject invalid values outright. Example:
```c
if (chan < 0 || chan >= MAX_TEMP_INDEX) {  
    return -1;  // or appropriate error handling  
}
```
Replace `MAX_TEMP_INDEX` with the specific upper bound of the arrays as defined elsewhere in the code.
