UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The pointer arithmetic `fifo_base + fifo_size` is performed on `void *` type, which is undefined behavior in C because the standard does not define arithmetic operations on pointers of type `void *`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Incorrect Pointer Arithmetic  
Bug Reason: The arithmetic `fifo_base + fifo_size` combines `void *` with an integer (`fifo_size`) directly. This can lead to incorrect pointer calculations as `void *` does not have a defined size for pointer arithmetic.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Cast the `void *` pointer to a byte pointer, such as `unsigned char *`, before performing arithmetic: `((unsigned char *)fifo_base) + fifo_size`.
