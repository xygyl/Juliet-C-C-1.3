UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing an out-of-bounds index in `strlen(p) - 1` when `strlen(p)` returns `0` (empty string). This case arises if `fgets` reads an empty line or `buf` contains an empty string. Dereferencing `p[idx]` at index `idx = -1` results in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds memory access
Bug Reason: Accessing `p[idx]` where `idx = -1` when `p` is an empty string results in an invalid access. This may lead to crashes, heap corruption, or unintended behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `strlen(p)` is non-zero before accessing `p[idx]`. For example:
```c
if (strlen(p) > 0) {
    idx = strlen(p) - 1;
    if (p[idx] == '\n')
        p[idx] = '\0';
}
```
This ensures no out-of-bounds access occurs for empty strings returned by `fgets`.
