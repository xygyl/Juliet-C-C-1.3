UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not check if the input `_block` pointer is `NULL` before dereferencing it. Passing a `NULL` pointer could cause undefined behavior when accessing `block[0]` or other indices.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `_block` is `NULL`, dereferencing `block[0]` or other indices will lead to a null pointer dereference, which is a memory-related bug and could cause a segmentation fault.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a `NULL` check at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!_block) {
    // Handle the error, return, or log it.
    return;
}
```
