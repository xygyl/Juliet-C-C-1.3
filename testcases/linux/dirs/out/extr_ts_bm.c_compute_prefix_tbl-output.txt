Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_ts_bm.c_compute_prefix_tbl.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Bounds violation in array `bm->bad_shift`**: The array `bm->bad_shift` is indexed using `bm->pattern[i]`. Given `bm->pattern` is used as the index, if the values in `bm->pattern` exceed the bounds of the array `bm->bad_shift` (which seems to be of size `ASIZE`), this would lead to undefined behavior via out-of-bounds array access. There's no guarantee that the values in `bm->pattern` are constrained between `0` and `ASIZE - 1`.  
2. **Bounds violation in array `bm->good_shift`**: Similar logic applies to `bm->good_shift` in its loop updates, particularly with `g` as an index, which could exceed the bounds of the allocated memory for `bm->good_shift`. The size of `bm->good_shift` is not validated against `g` when incremented.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The function accesses arrays `bm->bad_shift` and `bm->good_shift` using indices (`bm->pattern[i]` and `g`) that may go out of bounds, potentially resulting in memory corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Ensure array `bm->pattern` values are validated before use as indices into `bm->bad_shift`. Add a constraint that verifies all values of `bm->pattern[i]` are in the range `[0, ASIZE - 1]`. For `bm->good_shift`, add boundary checks on `g` to ensure it does not exceed the array bounds during computation. Also, ensure `ASIZE` and `bm->patlen` are correctly assigned based on memory allocated for `bm->bad_shift` and `bm->good_shift`.
