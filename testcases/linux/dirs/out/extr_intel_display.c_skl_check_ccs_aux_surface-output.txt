Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel_display.c_skl_check_ccs_aux_surface.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function performs a right-shift operation on potentially negative values (`src_x` and `src_y` derived from `plane_state->base.src.x1` and `plane_state->base.src.y1`). If these values are negative, signed right-shift invokes undefined behavior as per the C standard, where the behavior of right-shifting signed integers is implementation-defined for negative values.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate inputs such as `plane_state->base.src.x1` and `plane_state->base.src.y1` to ensure they are non-negative. This could lead to improper computation of offsets and positions, potentially causing incorrect rendering or memory address computations.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate `plane_state->base.src.x1` and `plane_state->base.src.y1` before performing the shift operation. Restrict these values to non-negative ranges explicitly using an assertion, logging, or safe guards. Example:  
```c
if (plane_state->base.src.x1 < 0 || plane_state->base.src.y1 < 0) {
    return -EINVAL; // or another appropriate error code
}
```
