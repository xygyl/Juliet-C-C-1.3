### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function references the `rsv_types` array, but its definition isn't provided in the code snippet. If `rsv_types` is a pointer that can be `NULL`, dereferencing it would result in undefined behavior. Additionally, if the `type` argument passed exceeds the bounds of the `rsv_types` array or leads to an invalid memory access, undefined behavior would occur due to out-of-bounds array access.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw / Potential Out-of-Bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: Logic assumes that `rsv_types[type]` will always return a valid result when `type` is between the bounds `[UWB_DRP_TYPE_ALIEN_BP, UWB_DRP_TYPE_PCA]`. However, if the `rsv_types` array is smaller than `UWB_DRP_TYPE_PCA + 1`, the function will end up accessing out-of-bounds memory, leading to a potential crash or unpredictable behavior. This is due to insufficient validation of the array size to match the expected range of `type`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Ensure `rsv_types` is properly initialized and contains enough entries to cover the range `[UWB_DRP_TYPE_ALIEN_BP, UWB_DRP_TYPE_PCA]`. Verify its size to avoid out-of-bounds access.
2. Explicitly check that `rsv_types` is not `NULL` before accessing it.
```c
if (rsv_types == NULL || type < UWB_DRP_TYPE_ALIEN_BP || type > UWB_DRP_TYPE_PCA || type >= sizeof(rsv_types)/sizeof(rsv_types[0]))
    return "invalid";
```
