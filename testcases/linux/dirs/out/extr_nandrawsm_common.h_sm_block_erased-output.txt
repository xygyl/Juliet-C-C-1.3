Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nandrawsm_common.h_sm_block_erased.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Misuse of `memcmp` with incompatible types. The `oob` pointer points to a `struct sm_oob`, while `erased_pattern` refers to an array of `uint32_t`. The `memcmp` call compares raw memory, but since the structures may have different internal layouts or padding, this can lead to undefined behavior per the C standard for strictly aliasing and proper alignment. Additionally, `sizeof(*oob)` may not match the size of the `erased_pattern` array.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The logic of the function expects `oob` and `erased_pattern` to have equivalent memory layouts for sensible comparison, but this assumption is wrong. This will lead to incorrect behavior when used with `struct sm_oob` that does not exactly match the memory layout of the `uint32_t` array.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the `oob` structure definition matches the memory layout intended for comparison or explicitly create a function to validate the erased pattern by iterating over fields in `sm_oob` rather than relying on raw memory comparison. Alternatively, specify the alignment and serialization of `oob` to match `uint32_t` for safety.
