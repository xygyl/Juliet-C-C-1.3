Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_exynos_drm_g2d.c_g2d_hw_reset.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences the `struct g2d_data *g2d` pointer (`g2d->regs` and `g2d->flags`) without ensuring that it is non-NULL. If `g2d` is NULL, dereferencing it would result in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: Since the function does not check whether `g2d` is NULL before accessing its members, passing in a NULL pointer as `g2d` would lead to a crash or undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL pointer check at the beginning of the function, e.g., `if (!g2d) return;`, to prevent dereferencing a NULL pointer.
