UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The operation `tmp &= ~(AT91_PMC_KEY | AT91_PMC_MOSCEN);` results in clearing the key bits (`AT91_PMC_KEY`) necessary for proper access to the `AT91_CKGR_MOR` register. If the key is cleared, subsequent write operations to this register will likely lead to undefined behavior in hardware access on AT91 systems, as the PMC controller requires a valid key.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: Clearing the key (`AT91_PMC_KEY`) before writing the value back to the `AT91_CKGR_MOR` register invalidates safe register handling. This logic flaw prevents the register write operation from succeeding in a predictable way, potentially causing hardware misconfiguration.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Modify the final operation to ensure the key is preserved during the write. For example:
```c
tmp &= ~(AT91_PMC_MOSCEN);
regmap_write(regmap, AT91_CKGR_MOR, tmp | AT91_PMC_KEY);
```
This ensures that the `AT91_PMC_KEY` remains valid when the value is written back to the register.
