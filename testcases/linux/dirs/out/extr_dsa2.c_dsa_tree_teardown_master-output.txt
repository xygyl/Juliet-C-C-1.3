UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `dst` or `dst->cpu_dp` is passed as NULL, dereferencing `dst->cpu_dp` would result in undefined behavior due to a null pointer dereference.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not check if `dst` or its member `dst->cpu_dp` is NULL before dereferencing it. This may lead to a crash or undefined behavior if a NULL pointer is passed.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL check for `dst` and `dst->cpu_dp` at the beginning of the function, such as:
```c
if (!dst || !dst->cpu_dp) {
    return;
}
```
