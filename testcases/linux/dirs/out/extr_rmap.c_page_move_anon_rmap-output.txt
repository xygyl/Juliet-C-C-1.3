UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The cast `(void *) anon_vma + PAGE_MAPPING_ANON` may lead to pointer arithmetic on a void pointer, which is undefined behavior according to the C standard. Pointer arithmetic is not valid on `void *` in strict C compliance because the size of the `void` type is undefined, and therefore the result of such arithmetic is undefined.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic bug / potential memory corruption
Bug Reason: The operation `(void *) anon_vma + PAGE_MAPPING_ANON` performs an invalid adjustment of the `anon_vma` pointer by adding an integer `PAGE_MAPPING_ANON` to it. Since `anon_vma` is expected to point to a valid structure, this operation may corrupt the value held in the page structure, specifically the `mapping` field. This inconsistency could lead to incorrect system behavior when dependent code attempts to interpret the corrupted value in `page->mapping`.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Replace `(void *) anon_vma + PAGE_MAPPING_ANON` with a well-defined operation such as `((struct anon_vma *) ((uintptr_t)(anon_vma) | PAGE_MAPPING_ANON))`. This performs a logical OR operation to set the specific bits for `PAGE_MAPPING_ANON` in compliance with pointer arithmetic rules and avoids the undefined `void *` arithmetic.
