UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Misinterpretation of Signed Integer Overflow**: In the loop modifying the `len` variable, if integer arithmetic exceeds the range supported by `size_t`, which is typically unsigned, undefined behavior can occur (e.g., truncation or unexpected wraparound). Additionally, pointer arithmetic might trigger UB because implicit underflow edges have differing results.Â¶
