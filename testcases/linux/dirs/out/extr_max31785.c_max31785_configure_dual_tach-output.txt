UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `info->func` is accessed without verifying that it is initialized or non-NULL. This constitutes undefined behavior if `info->func` is a NULL pointer.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference, Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The code assumes the `info->func` pointer has enough allocated space to handle `info->pages` and `virtual` indices without validating. If `info->func` is NULL or does not have the required memory allocated, this leads to invalid memory access (dereferencing NULL or writing out-of-bound), potentially causing a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Validate `info->func` for non-NULL before accessing or modifying it:  
   ```c
   if (!info->func) {
       return -ENOMEM; // Or appropriate error code
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that the `info->func` array has sufficient space for the operations on the `virtual` index. Dynamically allocate memory for `func` if necessary and handle allocation failures gracefully.
