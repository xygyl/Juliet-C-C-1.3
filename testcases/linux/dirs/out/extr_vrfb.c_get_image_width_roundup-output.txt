Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vrfb.c_get_image_width_roundup.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The calculation `(stride / VRFB_PAGE_WIDTH)` and `(stride % VRFB_PAGE_WIDTH)` could cause division by zero if `VRFB_PAGE_WIDTH` is not properly initialized or is zero. Division by zero is undefined behavior according to the C standard. No checks are performed to ensure `VRFB_PAGE_WIDTH` is non-zero before performing these operations.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic/Misuse of Undefined Variable  
Bug Reason: The code assumes that `VRFB_PAGE_WIDTH` is defined and correctly initialized to a non-zero value, which is not guaranteed from the provided code. If `VRFB_PAGE_WIDTH` is zero, this would lead to a division by zero error, resulting in undefined behavior.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `VRFB_PAGE_WIDTH` is non-zero before performing any division or modulo operations, e.g.:  
```c
if (VRFB_PAGE_WIDTH == 0) {  
    // Handle error or use default value  
    return 0;  
}  
```
