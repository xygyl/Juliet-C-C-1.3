Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_port.c_mlx4_reset_roce_port_gids.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potentially accessing beyond the bounds of the `roce_gids` array via `offset`. The `offset` variable increments in the `for` loop iterating until `num_gids`, but the base index (`base`) is unchecked against the maximum size of the `roce_gids` array (`MLX4_ROCE_MAX_GIDS`). If `base + num_gids > MLX4_ROCE_MAX_GIDS`, undefined behavior from out-of-bounds memory access occurs.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: Writing beyond the bounds of the `roce_gids` array could corrupt adjacent memory regions or cause unexpected crashes. Similarly, when copying entries to the mailbox, if `MLX4_ROCE_MAX_GIDS` exceeds the allocated mailbox size or the source data size, memory corruption could occur.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add range checks when calculating `offset` during the iterative write operations to ensure `offset` does not exceed `MLX4_ROCE_MAX_GIDS`. Additionally, verify that `num_gids` combined with `base` properly fits within the allocated size for both the `roce_gids` array and the mailbox buffer.
