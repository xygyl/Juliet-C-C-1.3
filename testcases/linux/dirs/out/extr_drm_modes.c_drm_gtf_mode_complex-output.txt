UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Access to `hfreq_est` in the computation of `ideal_duty_cycle` before it is initialized correctly. In the initialization of `ideal_duty_cycle`, division by `hfreq_est` occurs, but this value was computed earlier and potentially left uninitialized if the function flow doesn't execute its proper assignment. This results in division by an indeterminate value, which is undefined behavior. Additionally, integer division risks truncation errors or narrow overflow during operations with large values like `hfreq_est` in arithmetic manipulations.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: There is a logical bug because computations such as the initialization of `vsync_plus_bp` (`MIN_VSYNC_PLUS_BP * hfreq_est / 1000`) and `ideal_duty_cycle` (`hfreq_est/Belongs(for a compiler compute`).
