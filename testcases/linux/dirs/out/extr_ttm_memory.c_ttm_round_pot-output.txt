UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code implicitly assumes that `PAGE_ALIGN(size)` is a valid operation regardless of `size`. If `PAGE_ALIGN()` operates on non-zero size values and `size` is unaligned, but the operation is undefined (e.g., due to invalid memory or incorrect calculations), this could lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, `size & (size - 1)` assumes `size` is non-zero, but unsigned integers do not strictly ensure zero-value protection from UB, such behavior is sometimes practical but undefined for the design limits.
Bug Detected: כן  
Bug Type: Memory[-null]ansion barriers unsecured severity.]  
Bug Reason "<description>"
Bug Caused by UB: at ยัน conditions and Cons operations resolution internal characteristics mistakes!='b'}
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `PAGE_ALIGN(size)` is correctly implemented and well-defined for all possible input sizes. Add a guard condition to check that `size` is non-zero before performing `size & (size - 1)`, and ensure that invalid values for `size` are handled gracefully, such as returning `0` or an error code. Verify `PAGE_ALIGN` correctness independently.
