UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Pointer arithmetic involving `void` pointers is undefined behavior according to the C standard. Specifically, `(void *)func - here` performs subtraction of two `void *` pointers, which is not well-defined. `void *` does not define object sizes, and thus pointer arithmetic on it is undefined.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The calculation of `off` as `(void *)func - here` is incorrect because `void *` pointers cannot be reliably subtracted. This may result in an invalid offset computation, especially on platforms where `void *` arithmetic is problematic or has inconsistent behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Cast both `func` and `here` to `uintptr_t` (or a similar integral type capable of holding pointer values) when performing the subtraction:
```c
off = (uintptr_t)func - (uintptr_t)here;
```
This ensures the operation is well-defined and conforms to the C standard.
