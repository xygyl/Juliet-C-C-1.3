UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds access to the `rs_tx_columns` array due to `tbl->column` not being validated against array bounds before usage. If `tbl->column` has a value outside the valid indices of `rs_tx_columns`, it results in undefined behavior by dereferencing an invalid memory location.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Array Out-of-Bounds Access  
Bug Reason: The `tbl->column` index is used directly to access the `rs_tx_columns` array without ensuring it is within the valid range of indices. This can cause array out-of-bounds reads, which can be exploited to cause security vulnerabilities or program crashes.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:
Add validation for the `tbl->column` index to ensure it is within the bounds of the `rs_tx_columns` array. For example:  
```c
if (tbl->column >= ARRAY_SIZE(rs_tx_columns)) {
    // Handle error or return
    return;
}
```  
Here, `ARRAY_SIZE(rs_tx_columns)` is a macro used to determine the number of elements in the `rs_tx_columns` array.
