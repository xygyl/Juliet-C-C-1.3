UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Invalid `memcpy` size**: The expression `*o_txn_size = *o_mcp_param; memcpy(o_buf, raw_data, *o_txn_size);` assumes `*o_txn_size` is a valid and bounded size, extracted from `mb_params.mcp_param`. However, `*o_txn_size` is derived from hardware or external input (`mcp_param`), and its value isn't validated to ensure it doesn't exceed `MCP_DRV_NVM_BUF_LEN` or the capacity of the destination buffer (`o_buf`). If `*o_txn_size` exceeds these limits, undefined behavior occurs due to out-of-bounds memory access.  
   
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason:  
1. The `memcpy` operation can lead to a buffer overflow if `*o_txn_size`, derived from external data (`mb_params.mcp_param`), exceeds `MCP_DRV_NVM_BUF_LEN` or the size of the buffer `o_buf`. This is unvalidated, allowing for potential memory corruption.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
Validate `*o_txn_size` before calling `memcpy`. Ensure it does not exceed `MCP_DRV_NVM_BUF_LEN` (the size of the `raw_data` buffer) or the size allocated for `o_buf`. For example:  
```c
if (*o_txn_size > MCP_DRV_NVM_BUF_LEN || *o_txn_size > MAX_BUF_SIZE)  
    return -EINVAL;  
memcpy(o_buf, raw_data, *o_txn_size);  
```  
Note: `MAX_BUF_SIZE` would represent the maximum valid size for `o_buf` determined by the caller.
