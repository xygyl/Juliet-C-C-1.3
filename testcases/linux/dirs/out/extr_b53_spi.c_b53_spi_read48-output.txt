UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences `val` without checking if it is a valid pointer (non-NULL). Passing a NULL pointer for `val` to this function would result in undefined behavior due to dereferencing a NULL pointer.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: As part of the operation `*val = 0`, the pointer `val` is dereferenced without verifying whether it is NULL or not. This oversight may cause a crash or unexpected behavior in case a NULL pointer is passed.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for `val` at the start of the function:
```c
if (val == NULL)
    return -EINVAL; // Return an appropriate error code
```
Alternatively, document clearly that `val` must not be NULL when calling this function.
