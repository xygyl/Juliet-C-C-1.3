### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: 
1. The `buf[len] = '\0';` assignment assumes `len` will never exceed the allocated size of `buf`. However, while `len` exceeding `sizeof(buf)` is handled by the condition `if (len >= (ssize_t)sizeof(buf))`, there is no guarantee that logic errors won’t allow an overrun elsewhere. Explicit validations and safeguards are required.
2. `strtol()` can invoke undefined behavior if `buf` doesn’t contain a properly null-terminated string.
3. There is a potential strict aliasing violation when `scalar_t` type aliases default values. Although unused above).
