Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_trace_events_hist.c_hist_field_string.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The pointer arithmetic `(event + hist_field->field->offset)` is performed without proper type handling. `event` is declared as `void*`, and incrementing it by `hist_field->field->offset` (an integer) results in undefined behavior because arithmetic on `void*` is not defined in C.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Pointer Arithmetic Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The calculation `(event + hist_field->field->offset)` does not respect correct pointer arithmetic rules in C. Pointer arithmetic requires the base pointer to point to a specific data type, whereas `event` is a `void*`. This bug leads to incorrect computation of the target memory address and may result in dereferencing a wrong or invalid memory location.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Cast `event` to a `char*` before performing the pointer arithmetic. For example, replace `event + hist_field->field->offset` with `((char*)event) + hist_field->field->offset`.
