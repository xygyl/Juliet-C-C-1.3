UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Access to `coex_sta`, which appears to be a global or external pointer, is undefined behavior if `coex_sta` is uninitialized or a null pointer. No explicit initialization or null check for `coex_sta` is seen in the provided code. Accessing a null pointer is classified as undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `coex_sta` is null or invalid, dereferencing it to set `coex_sta->c2h_bt_info_req_sent` will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a crash. The code does not include a safety check to ensure `coex_sta` is valid before access.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `coex_sta` at the beginning of the function:  
```c
if (coex_sta == NULL) {
    return; // or handle the error appropriately
}
```
