### **UB Analysis**
UB Detected: Yes  
**UB Reason**: The function does not validate that the pointer `info` is non-null before dereferencing it. If a null pointer is passed to the function, dereferencing it via `info->flags` or `info->data` results in undefined behavior.  
Confidence: High  

### **Bug Analysis**
Bug Detected: Yes  
**Bug Type**: Null Pointer Dereference  
**Bug Reason**: If `info` is null, the function will attempt to dereference it, causing a crash at runtime. Even though the pointer type `struct swap_cluster_info *` suggests an object reference, the function doesn't assert or check the validity of the passed pointer before use.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### **Fix Suggestion**
Add a null check for the `info` pointer at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (info == NULL) {
    // Handle null pointer, e.g., log an error or return
    return;
}
```
This ensures that null pointer dereference is avoided and behavior is defined under all circumstances.
