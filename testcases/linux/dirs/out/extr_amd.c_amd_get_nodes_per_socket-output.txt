Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_amd.c_amd_get_nodes_per_socket.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The variable `nodes_per_socket` is most likely defined outside the scope of this function. Without any initialization or explicit definition within the file, there is a risk of returning an uninitialized value, which can lead to undefined behavior as per the C standard when reading and using such memory.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw / Uninitialized Variable Usage  
Bug Reason: `nodes_per_socket` is being returned without apparent initialization or validation within the code. If the variable is not properly initialized elsewhere, this code can lead to unpredictable results.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `nodes_per_socket` is properly initialized within the file or elsewhere before calling this function. You can explicitly check and initialize the variable if it hasn't been done already. Alternatively, document thoroughly where its initialization occurs and provide safeguards for potential misuse.
