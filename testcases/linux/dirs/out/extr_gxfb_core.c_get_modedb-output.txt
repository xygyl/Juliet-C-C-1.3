Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_gxfb_core.c_get_modedb.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `ARRAY_SIZE` macro is used on a scalar value `gx_dcon_modedb` and `gx_modedb`. This creates undefined behavior because `ARRAY_SIZE` typically expects an array as an argument, not a scalar type. Its behavior is incorrect for scalar values.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: Misuse of the `ARRAY_SIZE` macro on scalar expressions results in incorrect computation of `*size` values, which can lead to incorrect data handling or crashes if `*size` is used incorrectly based on invalid assumptions. The logic of the function is compromised by treating scalar values as arrays.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: Verify the definition of `gx_dcon_modedb` and `gx_modedb`. If they are intended to be arrays, ensure their definitions are appropriately set as arrays. Furthermore, confirm the behavior of the `ARRAY_SIZE` macro to ensure it operates correctly on arrays. If they are scalar values, remove `ARRAY_SIZE()` calls and replace them with proper fixed size assignments or dynamic calculations if an array representation is needed.
