### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: 
- The function relies on enumerations (`enum gdsc_status`) which may hold invalid values. If `status` is passed with a value not covered by the switch statement (neither `GDSC_ON` nor `GDSC_OFF`), the function will return `-EINVAL`, which doesn't strictly constitute UB itself; however, it generally violates the expectations for well-defined program behavior since no default action is taken to ensure undefined states aren't reached.  
- Use of signed integer values (e.g., `int ret`) combined with unchecked return values from `regmap_read` can potentially lead to UB if `regmap_read` fails in a way that leaves `ret` or other variables in an inconsistent state.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: 
- There is no validation of the `status` variable before the switch statements. If `status` holds a value outside the known enumerators (`GDSC_ON` and `GDSC_OFF`), the function will incorrectly try to handle undefined behavior such as by returning `-EINVAL`. This is a logic flaw, as the function assumes only valid values will be supplied, yet doesn't enforce it explicitly (e.g., through input sanitization).  
- Another possible bug is the unconditional use of `regmap_read`. If the operation fails (e.g., if the register map or input values are corrupt or unavailable), the program may exhibit unpredictable behavior due to an invalid `ret` being returned without further variable state consideration.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
- Add input validation for the `status` parameter. Ensure that no undefined enumerations are passed into the function prior to the switch statement. For example:
  ```c
  if (status != GDSC_ON && status != GDSC_OFF) {
      return -EINVAL; /* Invalid argument */
  }
  ```
- Add error handling for the `regmap_read` call to properly propagate failure conditions or sanitize outputs. For example:
  ```c
  if (ret) {
      /* Log or handle the error appropriately */
      return ret;
  }
  ```
