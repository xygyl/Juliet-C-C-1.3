UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow can occur if `A5XX_CP_DRAW_INDX_INDIRECT_5_INDIRECT_HI__SHIFT` exceeds the number of bits in the `uint32_t` (32 bits total). The result of `(val << shift)` is undefined if the shift amount is greater than or equal to the width of the resulting type. Additionally, if `val` is negative (though unlikely since it's `uint32_t`), the behavior of left shifting signed integers results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The operation `(val << A5XX_CP_DRAW_INDX_INDIRECT_5_INDIRECT_HI__SHIFT)` may silently truncate or discard significant bits of `val` if the `__SHIFT` value and the `__MASK` value are not carefully designed, leading to unintended results. This could cause incorrect behavior if the shift or mask does not align properly with the intended bit manipulation.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Validate that `A5XX_CP_DRAW_INDX_INDIRECT_5_INDIRECT_HI__SHIFT` is less than the width of `uint32_t` (32 bits). Add explicit code to check the shift value and enforce constraints on the mask values to ensure proper alignment and correctness:
```c
if (A5XX_CP_DRAW_INDX_INDIRECT_5_INDIRECT_HI__SHIFT >= 32) {
    // Handle error or safe fallback
}
return ((val & A5XX_CP_DRAW_INDX_INDIRECT_5_INDIRECT_HI__MASK) << A5XX_CP_DRAW_INDX_INDIRECT_5_INDIRECT_HI__SHIFT);
```
