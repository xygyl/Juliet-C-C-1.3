UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function appears to dereference a member (`now->tv_sec`) of a `struct timespec64` pointer (`now`) without checking if `now` is `NULL`. Dereferencing `NULL` results in undefined behavior as per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The potential `NULL` dereference of the `now` pointer would crash the program or lead to erratic behavior. This is analogous to dereferencing an invalid pointer.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a `NULL` check for the `now` pointer at the beginning of the function, such as:
```
if (!now)
    return -ENOMEM;
```
