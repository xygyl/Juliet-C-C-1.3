Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_aperture_gm.c_alloc_vgpu_fence.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The loop in `out_free_fence` accesses uninitialized elements of the `vgpu->fence.regs` array if `vgpu_fence_sz(vgpu)` is larger than the number of successfully reserved fences (i.e., `i`). Dereferencing uninitialized pointers leads to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw and memory clean-up error.
Bug Reason: If `i` is less than the value returned by `vgpu_fence_sz(vgpu)` when exiting the loop due to an error (in `goto out_free_fence`), the cleanup code attempts to dereference uninitialized array elements in `vgpu->fence.regs`, leading to erroneous calls to `i915_unreserve_fence` and potential null pointer dereference.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure the loop in `out_free_fence` only iterates up to the index `i` (the number of reserved fences), rather than the full size of `vgpu->fence.regs`. Change the loop condition in `out_free_fence` to `for (int j = 0; j < i; j++)` instead of `for (int i = 0; i < vgpu_fence_sz(vgpu); i++)`.

Corrected code snippet for cleanup:

```c
for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
    reg = vgpu->fence.regs[j];
    if (!reg)
        continue;
    i915_unreserve_fence(reg);
    vgpu->fence.regs[j] = NULL;
}
```

This ensures that only successfully allocated fences are cleaned up and avoids undefined behavior caused by accessing uninitialized array elements.
