**UB Analysis:**
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not cause any undefined behavior according to the C standard:
- The `rbsp_read_bit()` function checks for out-of-bounds access before accessing the `rbsp->buf` array via the `ofs >= rbsp->size` condition. This prevents out-of-bounds array access.
- Since `rbsp->buf` and `rbsp` are dereferenced directly without modification or validation within the function, the UB regarding null pointers would depend on external guarantees that the `rbsp` argument is valid, but this is outside the scope of the provided function.
- There is no signed integer overflow or other typical undefined behavior in the code.

**Bug Analysis:**
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function increments `rbsp->pos` regardless of whether the access is valid or not (`ofs >= rbsp->size`). If the condition for an invalid offset (`ofs >= rbsp->size`) is true and the function returns `-EINVAL`, `rbsp->pos` will still be incremented. This causes inconsistency in state management for `rbsp->pos` when an error occurs. Over time, this could lead to incorrect behavior or further errors.
Bug Caused by UB: No  

**Confidence:** High  

**Fix Suggestion:**  
Modify the function to increment `rbsp->pos` only when access is valid. For example:
```c
static inline int rbsp_read_bit(struct rbsp *rbsp)
{
	int shift = 7 - (rbsp->pos % 8);
	int ofs = rbsp->pos / 8;

	if (ofs >= rbsp->size)
		return -EINVAL;

	rbsp->pos++;  // Increment only after validating access
	return (rbsp->buf[ofs] >> shift) & 1;
}
```  
This ensures consistent state management and avoids side effects of incrementing the position during error situations.
