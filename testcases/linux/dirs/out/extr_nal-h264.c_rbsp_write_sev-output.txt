UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The expression `-2 * (*value)` may cause undefined behavior because `*value` is of type `int`, and multiplying by `-2` could cause signed integer overflow if `*value` holds the minimum representable value for a signed integer (`INT_MIN`). Overflow of signed integers is undefined behavior in C.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason: Signed integer overflow can occur when the function computes `tmp = -2 * (*value)` if `*value` is equal to `INT_MIN`. This would produce a result that exceeds the representable range of signed integers, leading to undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Instead of performing arithmetic directly on signed integers, use a wider type (e.g., `long long`) or check for boundary conditions to ensure no overflow occurs. Example:  

```c
if (*value < -((INT_MAX - 1) / 2) || *value > (INT_MAX - 1) / 2) // Boundary check
    return -EINVAL;

if (*value > 0)
    tmp = (unsigned int)(2 * (*value)) | 1;
else
    tmp = (unsigned int)(-2 * (*value));
```
This avoids overflow by adding boundary checks and using an unsigned type when interpreting the result.
