UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code contains several potential issues related to arithmetic operations and shifts:
- `val >> 9`, `val >> 8`, and similar operations assume `val` fits within an acceptable range for shifting. If `val` is a negative value (though constrained above zero via an `EINVAL` check), shifted operations on signed integer `__s32` can lead to undefined behavior per C standard rules.
- Although the comparison logic prevents some overflows, the calculation `val / 8`, `val / 4`, or truncating boundaries bypass masks present from signed compatibility-leading sequences where signed-off limits do risk newer UB stack cross-cut bugs as undefined-dimensional code hence overlapping.
