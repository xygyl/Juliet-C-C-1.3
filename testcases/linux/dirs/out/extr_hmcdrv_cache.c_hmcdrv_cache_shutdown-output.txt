Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hmcdrv_cache.c_hmcdrv_cache_shutdown.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Assigning `-1` to `hmcdrv_cache_file.ofs`, which is an `int`, may trigger undefined behavior if `int` cannot represent `-1` due to platform-specific issuesâ€”this is rare, but some platforms or compilers using unsigned `int` for `typedef int` could encounter UB. Alternatively, this may raise concerns if overflow happens *prior*.  

Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: None  
Bug Reason: While the code appears correct for its intended logic, and all fields of the `hmcdrv_cache_file` struct are properly cleared or initialized, no specific logic or memory bug is identifiable with the given code.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Verify the `typedef` of `int` on all target platforms to ensure it can represent `-1` safely, or, alternatively, cast explicitly if the signedness is questionable.
