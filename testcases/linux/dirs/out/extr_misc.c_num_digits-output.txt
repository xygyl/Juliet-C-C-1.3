Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_misc.c_num_digits.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The line `val = -val;` introduces undefined behavior if `val == INT_MIN`. For signed integers, the range is asymmetric, meaning the absolute value of `INT_MIN` cannot be represented in a signed integer, leading to signed integer overflow which is undefined behavior as per the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The undefined behavior described above due to signed integer overflow can lead to a logic error, as the calculation of the number of digits will be incorrect if the program encounters `val == INT_MIN`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before negating the value, specifically check for `val == INT_MIN` and handle this case separately. For example:  
```c
if (val == INT_MIN) {
    return 1 + num_digits(-(val / 10));
}
```
