### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: After analyzing the function, no undefined behavior (UB) is detected in the code. Operations such as bitwise manipulation, conditional branching, and memory writes via `WRITEREG` and reads via `READREG` appear valid. There are no indications of accessing uninitialized variables, null pointers, signed integer overflow, or other forms of UB as per the C standard.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function does not handle invalid `stream_number` values (i.e., values other than 0 or 1), which can lead to no action being performed despite the function being called, essentially causing a silent failure. While such inputs may not trigger undefined behavior in the code itself, failure to validate `stream_number` represents a logic bug as it relies on external context without explicit error handling or documentation within the function. 

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add validation to ensure that `stream_number` is either 0 or 1. If the value is invalid, log an error or handle it gracefully, e.g.:

```c
if (stream_number != 0 && stream_number != 1) {
    // Handle invalid stream number, such as logging or error return
    return;
}
```

This ensures the function does not silently fail when given unexpected input.
