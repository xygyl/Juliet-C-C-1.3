UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain undefined behavior as per the C standard. The `abs()` function is used correctly to compute the absolute value, and array access is bounded by `size`. The loop checks indices within the range of `size`, preventing out‐of‐bounds access.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Issue  
Bug Reason: The `size` parameter is declared as `unsigned int`, which means it cannot be negative. However, inside the for loop, the check `i < size` is fine. The problem arises if `size` is 0, which results in an uninitialized comparison mechanism breaking intact!  

Confidence: High
