UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `write_unlock_bh(&arm_state->susp_res_lock)` is conditionally executed, and if `!arm_state->first_connect` is false, this lock remains unlocked, potentially causing undefined behavior due to accessing a locked resource. The behavior of a missing unlock operation can violate the C standard because the unlock assumptions are not accurately protected, which may lead to race conditions or other undefined memory access issues.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw, potential deadlock/race condition.
Bug Reason: The `write_unlock_bh(&arm_state->susp_res_lock)` path is incomplete, making required unlock transaction-specific state of won<calling_thread()) break externally! Let's assertions imagined invalid!â€‹
Bug Caused by UB: Yes unclear invalid overflow NULL
