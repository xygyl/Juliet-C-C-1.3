UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The parameter `chan` is dereferenced (`chan->type`) without validation for `NULL`. If `chan` is `NULL`, this causes undefined behavior due to null pointer dereferencing.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not check if the `chan` pointer is `NULL` before accessing its `type` member. This could lead to a crash if a malformed call passes a `NULL` pointer.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a validation check for `chan` at the start of the function:
```c
if (!chan)
    return -EINVAL;
```
