Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_evsel.c_perf_evsel__new_cycles.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The use of `precise_ip` in the format string in the `asprintf()` call involves casting a `scalar_t__` to an `int` without ensuring its value is an appropriate integer (validity could depend on platform or compiler behavior). Also, if `asprintf()` fails (`< 0`), it does not reset `evsel->name` to NULL, and `evsel__delete(evsel)` assumes `evsel->name` is valid and dynamically allocated, leading to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory management bug  
Bug Reason: The `asprintf()` function call can fail and return `< 0`, leaving `evsel->name` uninitialized (not set to NULL). If this occurs, the call to `evsel__delete(evsel)` assumes `evsel->name` is valid and dynamically allocated memory, potentially causing undefined behavior when freed.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Check whether `asprintf()` successfully allocates memory and explicitly initialize `evsel->name` to NULL if it fails. Additionally, verify and sanitize the usage of `precise_ip` to eliminate the undefined behavior caused by casting.
