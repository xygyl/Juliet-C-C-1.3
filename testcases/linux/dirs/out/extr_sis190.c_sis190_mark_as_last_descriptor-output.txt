UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `desc` pointer is dereferenced without any null-check. If `desc` is null when the function is called, it will result in undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If the `desc` pointer is null, dereferencing it will cause a crash or undefined behavior at runtime.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null-check at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!desc) {
    return;
}
```
