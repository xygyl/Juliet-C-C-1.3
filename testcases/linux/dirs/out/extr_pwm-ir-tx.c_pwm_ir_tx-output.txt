Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pwm-ir-tx.c_pwm_ir_tx.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The computation of `delta` in the line `delta = ktime_us_delta(edge, ktime_get());` has potential for a signed integer underflow. `ktime_us_delta()` computes the difference between two times, but a scenario where `ktime_get()` returns a value greater than `edge` would lead to a negative `delta`. Since `usleep_range()` expects a positive argument, undefined behavior or unintended behavior could occur.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The signed integer underflow in `delta` could lead to incorrect execution or potential errors when calling `usleep_range(delta, delta + 10)`, which expects meaningful and positive delay arguments.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `delta` is verified as non-negative before passing it to `usleep_range()`. For example:
```c
if (delta > 0) {
    usleep_range(delta, delta + 10);
}
```
