UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `props` pointer is dereferenced unconditionally (`props->gid_tbl_len = 0;`), but there is a conditional check earlier (`if (ret || !props) return ret;`). If `props` is null and `ret` is not 0, undefined behavior will occur due to dereferencing a null pointer.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: There is a logical flaw where the function indirectly assumes `props` is non-null when `ret == 0`. This assumption can lead to a null pointer dereference if `props` is passed as null. Additionally, the function does not validate `props` before its usage.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add an explicit validation check for `props` before dereferencing it, independent of the return value `ret`. For example:
```c
if (!props)
    return -EINVAL; // or an appropriate error code
```
