UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Signed integer overflow**: The variables `src_offset` and `dst_offset` are `uint64_t` types, but `cur_size_in_bytes` is continuously added to them in the loop (`src_offset += cur_size_in_bytes` and `dst_offset += cur_size_in_bytes`). If these operations result in values exceeding the maximum capacity of a 64-bit unsigned integer (`UINT64_MAX`), undefined behavior occurs, as unsigned integer overflow leads to wrapping behavior which is not considered UB by the standard. This part is correct.
