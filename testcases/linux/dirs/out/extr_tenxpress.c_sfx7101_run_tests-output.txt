UB Detected: No
UB Reason: Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of undefined behavior. Potential risks like signed integer overflow, null/dangling pointer dereferencing, uninitialized variable access, or strict aliasing violations are absent from this code snippet.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential Memory-Related Bug
Bug Reason: The `results` array is accessed without validation of its size. The line `results[0] = rc ? -1 : 1;` assumes the pointer `results` points to a valid array with at least one element. If this assumption is incorrect (e.g., `results` is null or too small), this will lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption. Furthermore, the lack of validation for `results` means there is potential for a null-pointer dereference.

Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Validate the `results` pointer and ensure it points to a valid array of sufficient size before accessing or modifying its elements. For example:
```c
if (!results) {
    return -EINVAL;  // or another error code
}
// Proceed safely with array access.
results[0] = rc ? -1 : 1;
```
Additionally, document and ensure that the caller provides a valid, appropriately sized array to the function.
