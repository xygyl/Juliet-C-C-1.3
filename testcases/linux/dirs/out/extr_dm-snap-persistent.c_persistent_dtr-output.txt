Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dm-snap-persistent.c_persistent_dtr.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If the `ps` pointer returned by `get_info(store)` is `NULL`, multiple dereferences of `ps` fields (`metadata_wq`, `io_client`, `callbacks`) would lead to undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The code assumes `ps` returned from `get_info(store)` is always valid, but there is no validation or check to ensure that. If it is `NULL`, attempts to dereference its members will cause a crash or undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `ps` is not `NULL` before dereferencing its members. For example:
```c
if (!ps)
    return;
```
Place this at the beginning of the `persistent_dtr` function.
