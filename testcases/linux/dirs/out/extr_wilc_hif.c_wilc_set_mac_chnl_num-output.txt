UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The line `wid.size = sizeof(char);` has a mismatch between the `channel` variable type (`u8`, typically defined as `unsigned char`) and the hardcoded `sizeof(char)`. Using the wrong size when referring to data types can result in improper memory access. While likely harmless here, it technically constitutes undefined behavior as `sizeof(char)` is not guaranteed to correctly align with `sizeof(u8)`.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function incorrectly uses `sizeof(char)` for the `wid.size`, but the variable `channel` is defined as `u8`, which might be larger on certain platforms depending on the type definition. This could cause issues when the `wilc_send_config_pkt` function expects an exact size match for the `wid.val`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `wid.size = sizeof(char);` with `wid.size = sizeof(u8);` or `wid.size = 1;` to explicitly set the correct byte size. This ensures consistency with the `channel` variable's type definition.
