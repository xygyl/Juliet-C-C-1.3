Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_tc654.c_pwm_show.c

**UB Analysis**  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
The function accesses `tc654_pwm_map[data->duty_cycle]`, but there is no guarantee provided in the code that `data->duty_cycle` is within bounds of the `tc654_pwm_map` array. Accessing an out-of-bounds element of the array results in undefined behavior as per the C standard.

**Bug Analysis**  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access, Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason:  
If `data->duty_cycle` is greater than or equal to the size of the `tc654_pwm_map` array or is negative, this will lead to out-of-bounds access. The code does not validate `data->duty_cycle` before using the index, potentially leading to unreliable or erroneous execution. Additionally, there is no information that guarantees the integrity of `tc654_pwm_map`. The logic fails to ensure the memory safety of the accessed array.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

**Fix Suggestion:**  
Before accessing `tc654_pwm_map[data->duty_cycle]`, validate that `data->duty_cycle` is within the bounds of the array. For example:  
```c
if (data->duty_cycle < 0 || data->duty_cycle >= ARRAY_SIZE(tc654_pwm_map)) {
    return -EINVAL; // Or some other appropriate error code
}
```
Where `ARRAY_SIZE(tc654_pwm_map)` is a macro to calculate the size of the array safely.
