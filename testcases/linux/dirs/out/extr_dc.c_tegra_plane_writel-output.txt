Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dc.c_tegra_plane_writel.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function `tegra_plane_writel` assumes the `plane` pointer is valid and non-NULL but does not check for NULL before dereferencing it (`plane->dc`). Dereferencing a NULL pointer is undefined behavior in C.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `plane` is NULL, the code will dereference it (`plane->dc`), leading to a crash or undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `plane` is non-NULL before accessing its members. For example:
```c
if (!plane) {
    // Handle the error or return early
    return;
}
```
Alternatively, enforce that `plane` must not be NULL through comments or documentation for this function to ensure correct usage.
