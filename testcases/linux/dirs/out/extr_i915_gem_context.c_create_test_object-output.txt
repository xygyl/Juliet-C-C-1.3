UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential signed integer overflow when calculating `size` using `vm->total / 2`. If `vm->total` is extremely large, dividing it by 2 could lead to signed integer overflow depending on platform-specific definitions for `u64` or `size_t`. UB also occurs when `huge_gem_object` or other functions like `cpu_fill` are used without verifying non-null pointers. Finally, the `ERR_PTR()` is called on a signed integer (`err`), which causes UB because `ERR_PTR()` expects specific pointer manipulation macros (`PTR_ERR()`) in a platform-safe manner.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer overflow and invalid pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: Integer overflow when handling sizes passed into `round_down()` and pointer dereference issues from `IS_ERR()` checking. Also, missed verification in `file_add_object()` and `cpu_fill()` steps causes downstream pointer hazards.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add proper checks to verify the input size and minimize undefined behavior risks numerclinguistics clarintg size range crossings.
