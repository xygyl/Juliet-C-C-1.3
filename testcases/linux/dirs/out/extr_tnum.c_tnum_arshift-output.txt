Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_tnum.c_tnum_arshift.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed right shift of negative values invokes implementation-defined behavior in C. The shift operation `(s64)a.value >> min_shift` assumes implementation-specific behavior for signed numbers, which is undefined. Because `a.value` can be negative due to its type `s64`, this could lead to unexpected results on platforms with differing arithmetic shift behavior.  

Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: N/A  
Bug Reason: While the unsigned right shift operation on `a.mask` is well-defined, no memory or logic-related bugs are evident in the calculation itself. It correctly handles masking and shifts without accessing invalid memory or producing logical flaws.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: To ensure well-defined behavior across all platforms, explicitly use unsigned types for both `a.value` and `a.mask`. Alternatively, mask the signed value before performing the shift (e.g., `((unsigned)s64)a.value >> min_shift`) to avoid implementation-defined behavior for signed shifts.
