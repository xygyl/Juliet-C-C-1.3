Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_iwch_cm.h_compute_wscale.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Left-shifting a 16-bit value (`65535`) by `wscale`, where `wscale` can theoretically reach 14, causes signed integer overflow if `int` is the default integer type. The value `65535 << wscale` exceeds the maximum limit of a standard signed `int` (2^31 - 1) starting from a shift of approximately 1 bit past the signed integer boundary (depending on the platform).
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Signed integer overflow
Bug Reason: The shift operation results in undefined behavior and invalid calculations when the result exceeds the signed `int` bounds. This could cause incorrect computations for `wscale` values or runtime crashes depending on compiler optimization behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Replace `65535` with an explicitly unsigned type (e.g., `65535U`). This will force the result to be treated as an `unsigned int`, avoiding overflow: `while (wscale < 14 && (65535U << wscale) < win)`.

Example Fixed Code:
```c
static inline int compute_wscale(int win)
{
    int wscale = 0;

    while (wscale < 14 && (65535U << wscale) < win)
        wscale++;
    return wscale;
}
```
