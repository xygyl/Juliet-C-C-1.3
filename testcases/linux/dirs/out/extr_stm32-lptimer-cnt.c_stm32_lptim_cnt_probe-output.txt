UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code uses `IS_ERR_OR_NULL` macro to check `ddata` for validity. However, the function `dev_get_drvdata` can return `NULL` as a valid result depending on context. If `NULL` is returned for a legitimate reason (say, `ddata->has_encoder` or similar operations), treating this as an error is incorrect. The use of `IS_ERR_OR_NULL` in this case may lead to undefined behavior due to incorrect flow of logic based on its result.
Bug Detected: Yes
