UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `memcpy()` may access out-of-bounds memory if `number_sdp_streams` exceeds the allocated size of `req.u.allocate_payload.sdp_stream_sink`. The size of the destination (`sdp_stream_sink`) is not verified, and since its buffer size is not defined or checked prior to calling `memcpy()`, undefined behavior could occur during runtime.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: Buffer overflow can occur in `req.u.allocate_payload.sdp_stream_sink` due to the same issue described above if `number_sdp_streams` is greater than the size of the destination structure. The source buffer length (`sdp_stream_sink`) is not validated, and the destination buffer's allocation is not clearly scoped in the code fragment.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before calling `memcpy()`, validate `number_sdp_streams` against the size of `req.u.allocate_payload.sdp_stream_sink`. If `req.u.allocate_payload.sdp_stream_sink` is dynamically allocated or part of a fixed array, ensure its size is accurately defined and comparison checks are performed. For example:

```c
#define MAX_SDP_STREAMS_SIZE <appropriate size>

if (number_sdp_streams > MAX_SDP_STREAMS_SIZE) {
    // handle error, e.g., return early or log an error
    return -EINVAL;  // or appropriate error code
}
memcpy(req.u.allocate_payload.sdp_stream_sink, sdp_stream_sink, number_sdp_streams);
```
Alternatively, use a safer API like `memcpy_s()` if available.
