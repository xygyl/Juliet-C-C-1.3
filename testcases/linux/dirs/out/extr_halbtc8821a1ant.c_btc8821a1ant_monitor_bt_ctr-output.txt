UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences `coex_sta` without verifying whether it is null. If `coex_sta` is null, accessing its fields (`high_priority_tx`, `high_priority_rx`, `low_priority_tx`, and `low_priority_rx`) results in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `coex_sta` is a valid pointer, but there is no explicit null check or guarantee provided in the code. If the pointer is uninitialized or null, writing to its fields could cause a crash or memory corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `coex_sta` at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!coex_sta) {
    return;
}
```
