UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential signed integer overflow in `1000 * blackout_duration.value >> 24` when `blackout_duration.value` is large. The multiplication `1000 * blackout_duration.value` could overflow the range of a signed integer, resulting in undefined behavior. Also, division by `stream->timing.pix_clk_100hz` could lead to undefined behavior if `pix_clk_100hz` is zero, which is not explicitly guarded against.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Signed Integer Overflow, Division by Zero  
Bug Reason: The multiplication `1000 * blackout_duration.value` risks overflowing the signed integer type, which can lead to unpredictable behavior. The division by `pix_clk_100hz` risks a crash or undefined behavior if it is zero, and no check prevents this.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Ensure `blackout_duration.value` does not exceed a safe range to prevent overflow during multiplication, or explicitly cast it to an unsigned type to use wider arithmetic.  
2. Add a check for `stream->timing.pix_clk_100hz != 0` before performing the division.
