Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_kobject-example.c_foo_show.c  
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The code does not invoke undefined behavior as per the C standard. The variables used (`foo`, `buf`) are properly utilized and correct pointer dereferencing is performed for `buf`. The function `sprintf` is used safely, assuming `buf` has sufficient allocated memory, which is not checked in this local snippet.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The function directly assumes that `buf` is large enough to store the formatted string produced by `sprintf`. If the buffer passed to `foo_show` is smaller than what `sprintf` writes (e.g., the `"%d\n"` string for `foo`), this could result in a buffer overflow. This depends on the caller ensuring the size of `buf` is adequate, but this assumption is not explicit in the code.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Before using `sprintf`, ensure that the buffer `buf` is allocated with sufficient size, or use a safer alternative like `snprintf` to avoid potential overflow.
