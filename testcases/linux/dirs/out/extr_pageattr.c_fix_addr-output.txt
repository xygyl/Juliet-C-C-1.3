Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pageattr.c_fix_addr.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer shift of a negative value may cause undefined behavior in C when using `(addr << 1) >> 1` on `CONFIG_X86_64`. This operation can result in undefined behavior if `addr` is a signed integer and the left shift produces out-of-range values or incorrectly sign-extended values due to implementation-defined behavior of right shifts for signed integers. Though `addr` is unsigned (`unsigned long`), casting it to `long` introduces a potential issue (e.g., negative signed values).  
Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: None  
Bug Reason: While the operation contains UB, no observable bugs directly manifest unless runtime input to `addr` leads to problematic cases of signed conversion under the `CONFIG_X86_64` macro. The function may cause unintended values but does not directly result in memory or logic flaws observable from the code alone.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Explicitly cast `addr` to `unsigned long` prior to performing shifts, or avoid signed shifts altogether for clarity. For example:  
```c
return ((unsigned long)addr << 1) >> 1;
```  
Alternatively, use unsigned arithmetic first and only cast the final value if needed for signed contexts.
