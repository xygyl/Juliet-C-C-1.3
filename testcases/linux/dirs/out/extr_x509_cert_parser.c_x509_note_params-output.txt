UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential pointer arithmetic on `value - hdrlen` when `value` is of type `const void *`. In C, subtracting an integer from a void pointer is undefined behavior because void pointers lack a defined size for arithmetic.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `value` is non-NULL and aligned correctly before performing arithmetic operations. If `value` is NULL, the pointer operation `value - hdrlen` could dereference an invalid address when used elsewhere, causing unpredictable behavior. This also leads to incorrect behavior due to UB.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `value` is non-NULL before performing pointer arithmetic. Additionally, cast `value` to a suitable pointer type, such as `uintptr_t` or `char *`, before performing arithmetic operations to avoid UB.
