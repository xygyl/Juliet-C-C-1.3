UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. Potential dereference of uninitialized pointer `info` in accessing `info->gfx9.num_pipes`, `info->gfx9.pipe_interleave`, and other members. If `info` is NULL when passed to the function, dereferencing its members will result in undefined behavior. The code does not perform a NULL check on the `info` pointer.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: Same as UB reason. If `info` is NULL, dereferencing its members will cause a crash (segmentation fault). Since no explicit check for a NULL pointer is performed, this is a logic oversight that results in a bug.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Before using the `info` pointer, add a check to verify it is not NULL:  
```c
if (info == NULL) {
    // Handle error appropriately, e.g., log error, return, or use a default value.
    return;
}
```  
Alternatively, ensure that the caller guarantees `info` is never NULL within this function.
