Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cfg.c_lbs_add_rates.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses and modifies the `rates` array without bounds checking. This could lead to undefined behavior if `rates` is smaller than `ARRAY_SIZE(lbs_rates)`, resulting in out‐of‐bounds array access. Additionally, division by `5` in `lbs_rates[i].bitrate / 5` assumes `bitrate` is always divisible by `5`, and some implementations of C might categorize nonstandard floating-point behavior as undefined. 

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer overflow / Out-of-bounds write  
Bug Reason: This function writes to `rates` array based on the size of the `lbs_rates` array without verifying the actual size of `rates`, allowing potential out-of-bounds write, leading to memory corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking (`if (i < sizeof(rates) / sizeof(u8) && i < ARRAY_SIZE(lbs_rates)`) before writing to the `rates` array to ensure the operation stays within bounds.
