Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_oflib.c_string_match.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not check if `s1` and `s2` are `NULL`, which can lead to dereferencing a `NULL` pointer if either of the arguments is `NULL`. Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer is undefined behavior according to the C language standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `s1` or `s2` is `NULL` when passed to the function, the dereferencing operation `*s1` or `*s2` will cause a null pointer dereference, potentially leading to a crash or undefined runtime behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add checks for `NULL` pointers at the beginning of the function to ensure the arguments are valid:  
```c
static int string_match(const char *s1, const char *s2)  
{  
    if (s1 == NULL || s2 == NULL)  
        return 0;  

    for (; *s2; ++s2)  
        if (*s1++ != *s2)  
            return 0;  
    return 1;  
}  
```  
This would prevent undefined behavior and address the null pointer dereference issue.
