UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The variable `soc` is assigned using the function `da9150_fg_read_attr_sync`, and its return value is not validated to ensure it is within expected bounds. If the value returned by `da9150_fg_read_attr_sync` is unpredictable or out-of-bounds for `fg->warn_soc` or `fg->crit_soc` comparisons, this may lead to undefined behavior, such as misinterpreted logic or inaccessible memory due to unchecked assumptions.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The logic assumes that `soc` will always fall into one of three ranges, but it does not account for possible invalid return values from `da9150_fg_read_attr_sync`, such as errors or negative values. This could result in unintended behavior. Moreover, if the function `da9150_fg_read_attr_sync` fails and returns an error-like value (e.g., negative), the comparisons might lead to erroneous writes to hardware-controlled events.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate the return value of `da9150_fg_read_attr_sync`. Ensure that `soc` is within a valid and expected range (e.g., between 0 and 100) before performing further comparisons and actions. If it is invalid, handle the case explicitly (e.g., log an error or return early).
