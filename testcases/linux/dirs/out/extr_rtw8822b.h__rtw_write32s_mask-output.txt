Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_rtw8822b.h__rtw_write32s_mask.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The argument `addr` could potentially overflow when `addr + 0x200` is computed if `addr` is close to the maximum value for a `u32` type. This leads to undefined behavior due to unsigned integer wraparound, which is explicitly undefined as per the C standard for pointers.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason: If `addr` is close to the maximum value of `u32`, adding `0x200` may result in a logical bug due to the overflow. It might lead to an unintended address calculation and invalid memory access. If this memory is accessed by `rtw_write32_mask`, it could result in data corruption, invalid writes, or crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Before performing the addition `addr + 0x200`, ensure `addr` is within a range where the addition does not lead to overflow. For instance:
```c
if (addr <= 0xFFFFFFDF) {  // Ensure addr + 0x200 does not exceed 0xFFFFFFFF
    rtw_write32_mask(rtwdev, addr, mask, data);
    rtw_write32_mask(rtwdev, addr + 0x200, mask, data);
} else {
    // Handle error or restrict behavior
}
```
