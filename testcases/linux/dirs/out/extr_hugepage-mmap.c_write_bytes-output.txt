Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_hugepage-mmap.c_write_bytes.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `addr` is a `NULL` pointer or invalid memory region, dereferencing `addr + i` causes undefined behavior as it attempts to write to memory that may not be allocated or permissible for writing.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential null pointer dereference and out-of-bounds access bug  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `addr` points to a valid memory region of at least `LENGTH` bytes. If the pointer is invalid or points to insufficient memory, this could cause memory corruption or a segmentation fault.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add validation:
```c
if (addr == NULL) {
    return;
}
// Alternatively, check the validity of addr and ensure it can safely accommodate LENGTH bytes prior to usage.
```

Also ensure that the caller of `write_bytes` guarantees that `addr` points to a valid writable memory region of size `LENGTH`. Without such guarantees, this function could exhibit undefined behavior and memory-related bugs.
