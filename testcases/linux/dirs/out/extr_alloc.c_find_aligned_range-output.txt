Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_alloc.c_find_aligned_range.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Returning `-1` as an unsigned long causes undefined behavior because the value is implicitly converted to an unsigned type, resulting in wrap-around to a very large value. This violates the intention to signal an error with `-1`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: Returning `-1` (interpreted as `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` on systems where `unsigned long` is 64-bit) for an unsigned long result may lead to incorrect error handling in the caller code. It makes distinguishing failure cases impossible and can propagate incorrect values.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Change the return type from `unsigned long` to `long` to allow returning `-1` as an error signal correctly. Alternatively, define a sentinel error value (`ULONG_MAX` or similar) to represent failure explicitly for cases where `unsigned long` must be used.
