Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_amd.c_threshold_remove_bank.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function contains **double-free undefined behavior** due to `kobject_del(b->kobj)` and `kobject_put(b->kobj)` operating on the same object (`b->kobj`) without proper synchronization or verification. This could cause the same kernel object to be freed twice in certain scenarios. Additionally, if the `per_cpu(threshold_banks, cpu)[bank]` is accessed via an invalid index (or a corrupted memory reference), it might result in out-of-bounds access and undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Double-Free
Bug Reason: The function attempts to remove `b->kobj` using both `kobject_del` and `kobject_put`. If `kobject_del` already performs necessary cleanup operations to release the object, calling `kobject_put` could lead to unintended behavior or memory corruption (depending on how `kobject_put` manages the object lifecycle). Furthermore, `per_cpu(threshold_banks, cpu)[bank]` is set to `NULL` at multiple points without verifying its state beforehand, which can lead to potential inconsistencies or redundant calls.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Avoid calling both `kobject_del` and `kobject_put` back-to-back on the same object without checking its lifecycle (e.g., refcount). Investigate framework or documentation for `kobject` operations to ensure proper synchronization. Add bounds-checking or validations for inputs like `cpu` and `bank` to ensure `per_cpu(threshold_banks, cpu)` references valid memory locations.
