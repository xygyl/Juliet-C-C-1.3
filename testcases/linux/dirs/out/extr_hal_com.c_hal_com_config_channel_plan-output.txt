Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hal_com.c_hal_com_config_channel_plan.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses an uninitialized variable `AutoLoadFail` when `hw_channel_plan` is `0xFF`. While the variable is conditionally assigned (`AutoLoadFail = true`), its non-assigned state could still impact logic in subsequent operations earlier in the code. Access or reliance on uninitialized variables is undefined behavior as per the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: Conditional logic relying on an uninitialized variable (`AutoLoadFail`) can lead to unpredictable behavior. Specifically, if `hw_channel_plan` is not `0xFF`, the function might erroneously decide the channel plan based on invalid assumptions stemming from the uninitialized state of `AutoLoadFail`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Initialize `AutoLoadFail` to `false` explicitly at the beginning of the function. Avoid reliance on undetermined states. Example:  
```c  
bool AutoLoadFail = false;
```
