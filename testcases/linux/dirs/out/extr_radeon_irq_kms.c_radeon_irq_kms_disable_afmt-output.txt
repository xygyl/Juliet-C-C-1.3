UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function accesses `rdev->irq.afmt[block]`, but does not confirm whether `rdev->irq.afmt` is a valid pointer and whether `block` is within bounds for the array. If `block` is negative or exceeds the valid range for the array, this results in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: The lack of bounds checking on `block` before using it as an index into `rdev->irq.afmt` could lead to an out-of-bounds array write, causing memory corruption or unpredictable behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to verify that `block` is within the valid range of indices for `rdev->irq.afmt` before accessing or modifying the array. Also ensure `rdev->irq.afmt` is not null before dereferencing it.

Example Fix:
```c
if (block < 0 || block >= NUM_AFMT_BLOCKS || !rdev->irq.afmt)
    return;

spin_lock_irqsave(&rdev->irq.lock, irqflags);
rdev->irq.afmt[block] = false;
radeon_irq_set(rdev);
spin_unlock_irqrestore(&rdev->irq.lock, irqflags);
```
Replace `NUM_AFMT_BLOCKS` with the actual size of `afmt` if that information is defined elsewhere in the context. Ensure proper initialization and validation of `rdev->irq.afmt` during device setup as well.
