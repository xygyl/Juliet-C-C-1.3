Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_snic_ctl.c_snic_get_conf.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `wait` completion structure is declared on the stack (`DECLARE_COMPLETION_ONSTACK(wait)`) and a pointer to it (`snic->fwinfo.wait`) is stored in the `snic->fwinfo` structure. If the function exits, the pointer continues to reference stack memory that is no longer valid, leading to potential undefined behavior when the structure is accessed.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Use-after-scope
Bug Reason: The `wait` completion structure is a stack variable, yet its address (`&wait`) is stored persistently in `snic->fwinfo.wait`. When the stack memory for `wait` is reused for other operations during or after the function exits, accessing `snic->fwinfo.wait` results in use-after-scope bugs. This is a memory safety issue.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: Allocate the `wait` completion structure dynamically on the heap or ensure its lifecycle is properly managed (e.g., resetting `snic->fwinfo.wait` to `NULL` before the function exits or using a preallocated structure for `fwinfo.wait`).
