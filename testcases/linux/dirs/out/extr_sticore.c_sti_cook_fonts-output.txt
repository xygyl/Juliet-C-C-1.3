### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The calculation `raw_font = ((void *)font_start) + (raw_font->next_font)` is potentially unsafe. If `raw_font->next_font` points outside of valid memory or causes an alignment issue when casting to `void*` or dereferencing, it results in undefined behavior. Additionally, there's no validation or bounds checking on `raw_rom->font_start` or `raw_font->next_font`, which could lead to accessing out-of-bounds memory.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory-related bug (possible out-of-bounds memory access)  
Bug Reason: There is no verification that the values of `raw_font->next_font` or `raw_rom->font_start` point to valid, properly allocated memory. If these values are malformed or incorrect, it could cause out-of-bounds memory access or invalid pointer dereference, corrupting memory or crashing the program. Furthermore, unscoped recursive memory allocation (`kzalloc` in the loop) could lead to memory leaks if the function exits due to early conditions like lack of memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Validate `raw_rom->font_start` and `raw_font->next_font` to ensure they point to valid and correctly aligned memory locations before accessing them or performing pointer arithmetic.
2. Add bounds checking or sanity checks to ensure `raw_font->next_font` doesn't lead to reading/writing out-of-bounds memory.
3. Ensure proper error handling and freeing of allocated memory in case of allocation failure or early termination.
