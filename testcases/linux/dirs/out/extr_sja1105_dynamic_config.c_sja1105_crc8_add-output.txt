UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer left-shift operation can cause undefined behavior if the shifted value overflows the width of the type `int`. In the function, `(1 << 7)` is used and the result is cast to `int` due to type promotion. If `crc` or `byte` has a value such that `(crc ^ byte) & (1 << 7)` evaluates to true, subsequent operations like `crc <<= 1` can potentially cause signed overflow if `crc` becomes greater than 127 during the left shift. Signed overflow behavior is undefined in C.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer overflow  
Bug Reason: The left-shift operation on `crc` (by `crc <<= 1`) runs the risk of exceeding the range for `u8` (i.e., 0-255). While `u8` has a bounded range and unsigned overflow wraps around per standard C semantics, such wrapping can still result in unintended behavior and incorrect results for this CRC calculation logic.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Use an explicit cast to `u8` for intermediate results during the left-shift operations to avoid integer promotion issues and ensure operations are performed as intended. For example:  
```c
crc = (u8)(crc << 1);
```  
Additionally, consider adding comments clarifying assumptions about variable ranges to ensure correct usage.
