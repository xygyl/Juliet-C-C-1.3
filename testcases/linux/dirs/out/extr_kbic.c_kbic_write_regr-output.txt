### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `cont` variable is used to index the `cont_map` array without any bounds checking. If `cont` is negative or exceeds the bounds of `cont_map`, it results in out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior in C. Additionally, the return value or state of `cont_map` is not verified, leaving it vulnerable to corruption. Furthermore, in cases where `pi` could be `NULL`, dereferencing `pi->mode` results in undefined behavior, though this function lacks explicit checks for a `NULL` value for `pi`.

### Bug Analysis  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The `cont` variable is used without ensuring it is within valid bounds for the `cont_map` array, potentially causing out-of-bounds memory access.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion  

1. Add bounds checking for `cont` before accessing `cont_map`. For example:  

```c
if (cont < 0 || cont >= sizeof(cont_map) / sizeof(cont_map[0])) {  
    // Handle error  
    return;  
}  
```  

2. Verify that `pi` is not `NULL` before dereferencing `pi->mode`:

```c
if (pi == NULL) {  
    // Handle error  
    return;  
}
```  

Adding these fixes will prevent out-of-bounds access and improve the resilience of the function.
