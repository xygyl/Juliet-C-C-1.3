UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If the `request_firmware` function fails and does not initialize `*fw` to a valid pointer or NULL, dereferencing `(*fw)->size` causes undefined behavior due to a potential dereference of an uninitialized or null pointer.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If the `request_firmware` call fails and initializes `*fw` to NULL (as it does not check `*fw` explicitly before dereferencing), the line `size_t sz = (*fw)->size` will result in a null pointer dereference, which is a bug and could cause a crash. Additionally, there is a logical error during size verification if the firmware size itself is undefined or corrupted.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit checks for the value of `*fw` before dereferencing it. For example:
```c
if (!*fw || !(*fw)->size) {
    CX18_ERR("Invalid firmware pointer or size\n");
    return -EILSEQ;
}
```
This ensures no null pointer dereference happens and the program gracefully handles situations where `*fw` is invalid.
