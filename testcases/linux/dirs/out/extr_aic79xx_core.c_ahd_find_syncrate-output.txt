UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function modifies `*period` and `*ppr_options` without verifying if the pointers are non-NULL. Dereferencing a NULL pointer causes undefined behavior as per the C standard. Additionally, signed integers are not explicitly used in the code, so integer overflow is not a concern here.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: Since the function does not validate whether `period` or `ppr_options` pointers are non-NULL before dereferencing them, if the caller passes NULL for these pointers, the program will attempt to dereference NULL, leading to a null pointer dereference.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate `period` and `ppr_options` pointers for non-NULL before dereferencing them. For example:  
```c
if (period == NULL || ppr_options == NULL) {
    return; // or handle error appropriately
}
```
