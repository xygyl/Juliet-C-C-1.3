UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The use of floating-point arithmetic (`/ 1000.0`) in a kernel context is undefined behavior when the kernel has no support for floating-point operations. While kernel code is not expected to use floats and floating-point arithmetic, the operation depends on the architecture and compilation settings, which make it potentially unsafe and undefined in certain cases.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory-related bug  
Bug Reason: Since floating-point operations (`/ 1000.0`) are invoked between `kernel_fpu_begin()` and `kernel_fpu_end()`, the function assumes FPU usage explicitly protected. However, this can result in concurrency issues if another thread in the kernel performs floating-point operations without corresponding `kernel_fpu_begin()` and `kernel_fpu_end()` calls. Additionally, incorrect rounding may cause subtle inaccuracies since floating-point is not ideal for kernel code.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace floating-point arithmetic with integer arithmetic to avoid issues entirely. Use divisions with integers instead, such as `bb->sr_exit_time_us = dc->bb_overrides.sr_exit_time_ns / 1000;`. This ensures compatibility with kernel standards and avoids floating-point operations.
