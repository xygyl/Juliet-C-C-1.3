Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mount_clnt.c_decode_fhs_status.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function calls `xdr_inline_decode` and assumes its return value (`p`) is valid without checking its alignment. If the returned pointer's alignment is not suitable for dereferencing as a `__be32` type, dereferencing it (via `be32_to_cpup(p)`) would invoke undefined behavior. This violates the C standard's requirement for pointer alignment.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The function sets `res->errno` to `-EACCES`, which is an invalid value for an `errno` (typically expected to be positive values corresponding to system error codes). This is likely a conceptual mistake or oversight.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Ensure that `xdr_inline_decode` always returns a properly aligned pointer for `__be32`, or verify alignment explicitly before dereferencing.
2. Correct the usage of `res->errno` to use positive error codes (e.g., `EACCES` instead of `-EACCES`) unless the design explicitly requires negative values (which should be documented and explained clearly).
