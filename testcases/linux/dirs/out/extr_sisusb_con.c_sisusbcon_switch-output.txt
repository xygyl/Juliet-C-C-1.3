UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is a possible undefined behavior in the `memcpy` function call due to arbitrary `length` without bounds checking. Specifically, if `length` exceeds the allocated memory range of `c->vc_screenbuf` or `c->vc_origin`, the behavior is undefined since it may lead to out-of-bounds memory access. Additionally, potential type aliasing issues may arise in the casting `(u16 *)`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The function calculates `length` using `min()` but does not guarantee that `c->vc_origin + length` remains within valid bounds of allocated memory. This may cause buffer overflow during the `memcpy` operation if `length` exceeds the capacity of `c->vc_screenbuf` or `c->vc_origin`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `length` is validated against both `vc_screenbuf_size` and the allocated memory size at `vc_origin` explicitly before invoking `memcpy`. This can prevent out-of-bounds access and undefined behavior. Additionally, confirm that `u16` type matches the expectations of the data being copied to avoid strict aliasing violations.
