Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mtk-quadspi.c_mtk_nor_write_buffer.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function performs unchecked indexing into the `buf` array. If the size of `buf` is less than `SFLASH_WRBUF_SIZE`, this would result in out-of-bounds access, which is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: **Buffer Overflow**  
Bug Reason: The loop does not verify the size of the provided `buf`. If the length of `buf` is less than `SFLASH_WRBUF_SIZE`, it will cause memory access beyond the bounds of the array, leading to a buffer overflow.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that the `buf` array has sufficient elements for the loop's indexing, ideally by passing the size of the buffer as an additional parameter or calculating it beforehand. Modify the loop condition like this:  
```c
for (i = 0; i < SFLASH_WRBUF_SIZE && (bufidx + 3) < buf_size; i += 4) {
```
and ensure `buf_size` is passed as an argument to the function and properly validated.
