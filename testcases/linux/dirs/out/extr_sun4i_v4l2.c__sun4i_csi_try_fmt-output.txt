### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code has potential for undefined behavior due to inconsistent access to the `plane_fmt` array in `pix`:
- `pix->plane_fmt[i]` is accessed without verifying the bounds of `i`, meaning there could be an out-of-bounds access if `_fmt->num_planes` exceeds the actual size of the `plane_fmt` array in `pix`. This violates the array bounds rules, leading to undefined behavior.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory-related bug (out-of-bounds array access)  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that the size of the `plane_fmt` array matches `_fmt->num_planes`, but without validation, there is a risk of reading/writing out of bounds for `plane_fmt`. This could corrupt data, crash the program, or produce unintended behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
- Validate that the `plane_fmt` array in `pix` has sufficient size to accommodate `_fmt->num_planes` before accessing `pix->plane_fmt[i]`. For example:
  ```c
  if (pix->num_planes < _fmt->num_planes) {
      // Handle the error appropriately, e.g., return or log a warning.
      return;
  }
  ```
