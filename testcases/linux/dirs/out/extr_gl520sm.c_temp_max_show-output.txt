Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_gl520sm.c_temp_max_show.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses `data->temp_max[n]` without verifying that `n` is within the bounds of the `temp_max` array. This could lead to undefined behavior if `n` is negative or too large, causing out-of-bounds access.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: If `n` falls outside the valid range of indices for the `temp_max` array, it will result in out-of-bounds memory access. This may cause incorrect behavior or memory corruption, depending on the system's memory layout.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check for `n` to ensure that it is within the valid range of the `temp_max` array before accessing `data->temp_max[n]`. Example:  
```c
if (n < 0 || n >= ARRAY_SIZE(data->temp_max)) {
    return -EINVAL;  // Return an error code for invalid index
}
```
