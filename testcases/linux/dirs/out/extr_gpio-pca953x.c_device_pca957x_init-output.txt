UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code uses the array `val[MAX_BANK]`, but the size of `MAX_BANK` is not defined in the current snippet, and accessing the array beyond its allocated size causes undefined behavior. Additionally, the `NBANK(chip)` macro, unless proven to return a value less than or equal to `MAX_BANK`, may lead to buffer overflows when used in `memset()`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: If `NBANK(chip)` exceeds `MAX_BANK`, the code will write out-of-bounds to the `val` array in `memset()` and potentially in `pca953x_write_regs()`, resulting in memory corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Verify that `NBANK(chip)` always yields a value less than or equal to `MAX_BANK`. Include sanity checks or increase the size of `val` to the maximum possible `NBANK(chip)` value based on requirements. Alternatively, ensure code clarity by defining `MAX_BANK` appropriately or using dynamic memory allocation for `val` if its size depends on runtime conditions.
