Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_iscsi_target_seq_pdu_list.c_iscsit_do_build_pdu_and_seq_lists.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Unbounded accesses to `pdu[i]` and `seq[seq_no]` pose a risk of out-of-bounds array access if `i` or `seq_no` exceed the allocated length for `pdu_list` or `seq_list`. The function does not validate whether these indices remain within their respective bounds. This violates the C standard, which defines out-of-bounds array access as undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: The indices `i` and `seq_no` are incremented based on variable-length data without any checks to ensure they remain within array bounds. If the `pdu_list` and `seq_list` arrays do not have sufficient allocated size to handle large data lengths or burst sizes, this will result in buffer overflows or memory corruption.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit checks to verify that `i` and `seq_no` do not exceed the allocated sizes of the `pdu_list` and `seq_list` arrays respectively before accessing or modifying their elements. For example:  

```c
if (i >= allocated_pdu_list_size || seq_no >= allocated_seq_list_size) {
    // Handle error: insufficient allocation
    return -1;
}
```  

This ensures the function doesn't perform out-of-bounds memory writes and adheres to safe programming practices.
