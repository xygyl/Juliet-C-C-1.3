Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_atyfb_base.c_atyfb_sync.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function contains potential undefined behavior due to the lack of a null pointer check before dereferencing `info->par`. If `info` itself is NULL or `info->par` is NULL, dereferencing `par` will result in undefined behavior. This is because dereferencing a null pointer is explicitly undefined according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: If `info->par` is NULL, then casting it and eventually dereferencing the resulting pointer (`par`) will lead to a crash. This can result in a runtime error, exposing a real bug in the function.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a safety check at the beginning of the function to ensure `info` and `info->par` are not NULL before dereferencing:  

```c
if (!info || !info->par) {
    return -1; // Or an appropriate error code
}
```
