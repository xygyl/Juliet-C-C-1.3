UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `ktime_get_real_seconds()` function is called to assign a value to both `last_unread_rtas_event` and `last_rtas_event`. These variables are declared as `void*`, which causes undefined behavior because the result of `ktime_get_real_seconds()` is likely not a pointer but some other data type (e.g., integer or time-related type), and assigning it to `void*` violates strict typing rules and could cause misaligned access depending on platform architecture.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, Undefined behavior-induced bug  
Bug Reason: Assigning non-pointer values to variables declared as `void*` leads to incorrect logic and potential runtime crashes due to misalignment or invalid memory accesses if those variables are later used as pointers.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Change the declaration of `last_unread_rtas_event` and `last_rtas_event` to an appropriate type, such as `time_t` or another type that matches the return type of `ktime_get_real_seconds()`. For instance:  
```c  
time_t last_unread_rtas_event;  
time_t last_rtas_event;  
```  
Alternatively, if `void*` is intentionally used for some other reason, ensure proper casting and handling of the returned value from `ktime_get_real_seconds()` before assignment.
