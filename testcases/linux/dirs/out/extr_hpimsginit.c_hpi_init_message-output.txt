**UB Analysis**  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Accessing msg_size array with potentially out-of-bounds index**: When `object > HPI_OBJ_MAXINDEX`, there is a code path that doesn't perform bounds checking on `msg_size[object]`. In this case, the `object` value may not be valid within the bounds of the `msg_size` array, leading to out-of-bounds access, which is undefined behavior in C.  
2. **Misuse of `array_index_nospec`**: The call to `array_index_nospec(object, HPI_OBJ_MAXINDEX + 1)` introduces speculative execution mitigation but does not prevent an out-of-bounds index from accessing `msg_size`. If `object` is greater than `HPI_OBJ_MAXINDEX`, the condition `(object <= HPI_OBJ_MAXINDEX)` will be false, and no revalidation occurs before accessing `msg_size[object]`.  

**Bug Analysis**  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Corruption (Out-of-Bounds Array Access)  
Bug Reason:  
As detailed in the UB analysis, when an invalid `object` is supplied (greater than `HPI_OBJ_MAXINDEX`), the code can access `msg_size[object]` without validating the index, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This may result in incorrect program behavior or memory corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

**Fix Suggestion**:  
1. Add a robust bounds check for `object` before using it to access the `msg_size` array. For example:
   ```c
   if ((object > 0) && (object <= HPI_OBJ_MAXINDEX) && object < ARRAY_SIZE(msg_size)) {
       object = array_index_nospec(object, HPI_OBJ_MAXINDEX + 1);
       size = msg_size[object];
   } else {
       size = sizeof(*phm);
   }
   ```
2. Ensure proper handling of cases where `object` is invalid to prevent unintended behavior (e.g., log an error or return an error code).
