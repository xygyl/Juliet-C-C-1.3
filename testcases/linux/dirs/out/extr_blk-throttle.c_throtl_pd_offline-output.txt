UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing elements of arrays (`tg->bps`, `tg->iops`) using indices without ensuring that the indices are within bounds may lead to out-of-bounds access, potentially invoking undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The function assumes that arrays `tg->bps` and `tg->iops` have sufficient size (e.g., `READ` and `LIMIT_LOW` indices exist). If the array is smaller than expected, this leads to an out-of-bounds access, which is both a bug and undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before accessing `tg->bps` and `tg->iops`, ensure that the indices (`READ`, `WRITE`, and `LIMIT_LOW`) fall within the bounds of the respective arrays. Validate their size or constrain the indices to prevent out-of-bound access.
