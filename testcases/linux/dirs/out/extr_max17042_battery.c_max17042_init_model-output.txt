UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences pointers `chip` and `chip->pdata->config_data` without validating that they are non-NULL, leading to potential undefined behavior if these pointers are NULL.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: `chip`, `chip->pdata`, and `chip->pdata->config_data` are dereferenced directly without checking their validity. If any of these pointers are NULL, this will result in a null pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior. Additionally, there is no explicit guarantee that `ARRAY_SIZE(chip->pdata->config_data->cell_char_tbl)` is non-zero, which could lead to problems if `table_size == 0`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add NULL pointer checks for `chip`, `chip->pdata`, and `chip->pdata->config_data` at the beginning of the function. For example:  
```c
if (!chip || !chip->pdata || !chip->pdata->config_data)  
    return -EINVAL;  
```  
Additionally, ensure that `table_size` is validated to be greater than zero before using it for memory allocation or other operations.
