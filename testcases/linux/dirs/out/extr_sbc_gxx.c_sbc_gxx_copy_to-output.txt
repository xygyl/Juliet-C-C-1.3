UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Pointer arithmetic is performed on `const void *from`, which may point to any type, and this violates strict aliasing rules when the object type is incompatible with the pointer type. Additionally, casting the pointer `from` directly to perform arithmetic without proper context can lead to undefined behavior. Moreover, using `iomapadr`, which is modified outside the function scope, assumes it is correctly initialized and mapped, but if `iomapadr` is uninitialized or invalid, behavior is undefined.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Pointer Arithmetic Error
Bug Reason: The increment operation `from += thislen;` is problematic because `from` is a `void*`, and pointer arithmetic on `void*` is a GNU extension but not standard C. It causes incorrect memory address calculations unless compiled using GCC or compatible compilers with extensions enabled. Furthermore, the `iomapadr` pointer does not appear to be verified for validity prior to use, which could lead to invalid memory access.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
1. Cast `from` to a proper type like `const char*` before performing pointer arithmetic:  
   ```c
   const char *from_ptr = from;
   from_ptr += thislen;
   ```
2. Validate `iomapadr` before using it to ensure it points to a valid memory-mapped I/O region.
