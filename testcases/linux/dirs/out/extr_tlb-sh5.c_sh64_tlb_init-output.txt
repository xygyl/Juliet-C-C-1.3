UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing an assumed pointer (`cpu_data`) without verification can result in undefined behavior if the pointer is null or uninitialized. The code does not guarantee that `cpu_data` is initialized to a valid memory address before accessing its members.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The `cpu_data` pointer is dereferenced multiple times without checks for validity (e.g., whether it is null). If the pointer `cpu_data` is null or invalid, this would lead to undefined behavior and potentially a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add checks for the validity of `cpu_data` (e.g., `if (!cpu_data) return -1;`) at the beginning of the function, ensuring it is properly initialized and valid before dereferencing.
