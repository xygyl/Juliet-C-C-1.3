UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `substream->runtime` or `substream->runtime->private_data` is `NULL`, dereferencing these pointers will result in undefined behavior. There is no check to ensure that `substream->runtime` and `substream->runtime->private_data` are valid before using them.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function directly accesses `substream->runtime->private_data` without verifying that `substream->runtime` and its members are non-null. If `substream` is improperly initialized or derived from an invalid state, this could lead to a crash due to null pointer dereference.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add null checks for `substream->runtime` and `substream->runtime->private_data` before using them. Example:
```c
if (!substream->runtime || !substream->runtime->private_data) {
    dev_err(component->dev, "Invalid runtime or private_data\n");
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
Additionally, verify that `substream->private_data` and `component` are non-null after retrieval to prevent other potential null pointer dereferences.
