Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_rx.c_remove_monitor_info.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not validate if `present_fcs_len` is greater than `skb->len`. Subtracting a larger value from `skb->len` in `__pskb_trim` will result in an overflow and could lead to undefined behavior when operating on a negative value interpreted as an unsigned integer type internally.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: Lack of validation on `present_fcs_len` could cause `__pskb_trim` to operate incorrectly and potentially trim the buffer beyond its actual length, introducing buffer corruption. Furthermore, if `rtap_space` exceeds the size of the buffer, `__pskb_pull` may cause out-of-bounds access or incorrect state of `skb`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add validation for `present_fcs_len` and `rtap_space`:
```c
if (present_fcs_len > skb->len)
    return; // Or handle error appropriately

if (rtap_space > skb->len - present_fcs_len)
    return; // Or handle error appropriately
``` 
These checks would ensure neither `__pskb_trim` nor `__pskb_pull` operates on out-of-range parameters.
