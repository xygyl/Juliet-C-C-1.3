### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
- The function assumes that the input pointer `p` will always be either `SEQ_START_TOKEN` or a valid pointer to a `struct rb_node`. However, if `p` is not valid or correctly initialized, dereferencing it to pass as an argument to `rb_next(node)` could lead to undefined behavior (e.g., dereferencing a NULL pointer or an arbitrary memory location).
- There is no explicit validation or guarantee anywhere in the code that `p` is either `SEQ_START_TOKEN` or a valid instance of `struct rb_node`. If `p` has an invalid or corrupted value, undefined behavior could occur.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Invalid memory access  
Bug Reason:  
- If `p` is invalid (e.g., if it is an invalid pointer or null and not equal to `SEQ_START_TOKEN`), calling `rb_next(node)` will result in an invalid memory access, leading to a crash or unpredictable behavior.
- Similarly, if `session->stat_root` is empty, `rb_first(&session->stat_root)` may also lead to unintended behavior (though this may depend on the exact implementation of `rb_first()` and `rb_next()` in the red-black tree library, which is not included in the provided code).

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Add validation for `p` before dereferencing it or passing it to `rb_next(node)`. For example:
   ```c
   if (p != SEQ_START_TOKEN && p == NULL) {
       return NULL;
   }
   ```
2. Check the return value of `rb_first()` and `rb_next()` to ensure they are valid before proceeding further. Ensure proper handling if the tree is empty (i.e., `session->stat_root` does not contain any nodes).
