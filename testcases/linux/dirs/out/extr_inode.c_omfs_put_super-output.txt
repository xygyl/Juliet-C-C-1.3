Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_inode.c_omfs_put_super.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code does not check if `sbi` (obtained from `OMFS_SB(sb)`) is `NULL` before performing `kfree()` on `sbi` and its member (`s_imap`). If `sbi` is `NULL`, dereferencing `sbi->s_imap` would also cause undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: The code fails to validate whether `sbi` (obtained from `OMFS_SB(sb)`) is `NULL`, which could lead to a null pointer dereference or double-free issue if `sb->s_fs_info` is already nullified elsewhere in the code path.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for `sbi` before dereferencing or freeing it. Example:

```c
static void omfs_put_super(struct super_block *sb)
{
    struct omfs_sb_info *sbi = OMFS_SB(sb);
    if (!sbi)
        return;
    kfree(sbi->s_imap);
    kfree(sbi);
    sb->s_fs_info = NULL;
}
```
