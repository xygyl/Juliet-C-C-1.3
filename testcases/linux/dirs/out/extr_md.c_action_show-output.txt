Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_md.c_action_show.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code uses `sprintf` to write to the provided `page` buffer without verifying that the buffer has sufficient size to hold the resulting string and its null terminator. Without validation of the `page` buffer size, this can lead to undefined behavior in case of buffer overflows.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: There is no check to validate that the `page` buffer has sufficient space for the string written by `sprintf`. If the `page` buffer is too small, it will result in a buffer overflow, corrupting memory and potentially causing a crash or security vulnerability.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use `snprintf` instead of `sprintf` and pass the `page` buffer size as an argument to ensure no more characters are written than the buffer can hold. Alternatively, perform manual bounds checking on the `page` buffer length before using `sprintf`.

Example fix:
```c
return snprintf(page, PAGE_SIZE, "%s\n", type);
```
(`PAGE_SIZE` should represent the size of the `page` buffer allocated in the calling context.)
