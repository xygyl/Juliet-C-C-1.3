UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `regmap_st` global variable is used without being explicitly initialized, and its value is unknown. If `regmap_st` is null or invalid, the behavior is undefined upon passing it to `regmap_write`. Also, calling `mdelay` with a potentially large constant (2000) may lead to undefined behavior in systems with overflow in timing calculations, depending on the architecture/platform implementation.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw/Potential Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `regmap_st` is null, both `regmap_write` calls will dereference a null pointer and result in a crash. Furthermore, the function does not ensure that the reset mechanism succeeds after calling `mdelay`, and the subsequent `pr_emerg` line indicates the failure, but it does not handle the failure gracefully (e.g., retry, alternate recovery mechanisms, etc.).  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Ensure `regmap_st` is properly initialized before calling `regmap_write`. Add checks to confirm that `regmap_st` is not null prior to accessing it.  
2. Validate if the hardware reset sequence succeeds, possibly by checking relevant status flags or retrying the operation.
