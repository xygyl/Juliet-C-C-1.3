Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_irq-stm32-exti.c_stm32_exti_set_type.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing potentially invalid pointers (`rtsr` and `ftsr`) without checking if they are `NULL`. While these pointers are expected to be valid, the function does not explicitly ensure this assumption. Passing a `NULL` pointer for `rtsr` or `ftsr` would result in undefined behavior due to invalid memory access.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference Potential  
Bug Reason: The function assumes `rtsr` and `ftsr` are always valid pointers but does not validate them. If either pointer is `NULL`, this causes undefined behavior and would trigger a crash upon dereference.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Add a validation check for `rtsr` and `ftsr` at the beginning of the function:  
```c
if (!rtsr || !ftsr) {
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
