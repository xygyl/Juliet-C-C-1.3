Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fpu_arith.c_fsubr_.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function `fsubr_()` performs operations using the `FPU_rm`, `control_word`, and `REV` variables without initializing them explicitly in the code snippet provided. Accessing uninitialized variables results in undefined behavior according to the C standard since their values are indeterminate.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic bugs / Undefined behavior usage
Bug Reason: Using uninitialized variables (`FPU_rm`, `REV`, `control_word`) likely leads to incorrect function behavior and potentially corrupted results from `FPU_sub()` due to unpredictable variable values. Additionally, if these variables are expected to hold specific values or states for floating-point arithmetic operations, their uninitialized condition would invalidate the computation logic.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `FPU_rm`, `control_word`, and `REV` are properly initialized before calling `FPU_sub()`. For example, assign default, meaningful values or verify they have been set correctly elsewhere in the program prior to use.
