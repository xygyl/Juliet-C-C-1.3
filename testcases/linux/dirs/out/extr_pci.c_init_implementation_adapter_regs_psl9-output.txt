UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses `adapter->native` without checking if `adapter` or `adapter->native` are `NULL`. Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer is undefined behavior as per the C standard. Similarly, `dev->dev` is used without validation, and if `dev` or `dev->dev` were `NULL`, this would lead to UB as well.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: Potential `NULL` dereference occurs with `adapter->native->no_data_cache` in the line `adapter->native->no_data_cache = true;`, and also with `dev_dbg(&dev->dev, ...)`, as there is no guarantee that `adapter`, `adapter->native`, or `dev->dev` are non-NULL when accessed.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
- Add checks to ensure `adapter`, `adapter->native`, and `dev->dev` are not `NULL` before accessing them. For instance:  

```c
if (!adapter || !adapter->native) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return appropriate error code
}

if (!dev || !dev->dev) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return appropriate error code
}
```

This ensures safe access and prevents potential crashes or undefined behavior due to dereferencing `NULL`.
