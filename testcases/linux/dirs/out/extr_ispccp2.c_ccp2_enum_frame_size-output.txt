Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_ispccp2.c_ccp2_enum_frame_size.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The operation `format.width = -1` and `format.height = -1` assigns negative values to members of a `struct v4l2_mbus_framefmt` object, where `width` and `height` likely represent dimensions (unsigned or non-negative values in expected usage). This can lead to undefined behavior depending on how the data is later interpreted. If these fields are processed without additional checks (e.g., casting to unsigned-int equivalents or being used for configurations expecting positive values), undefined behavior may occur.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: Assigning negative `width` and `height` values (`-1`) is semantically incorrect if dimensions are meant to represent sizes, which are inherently non-negative. Even if such a pattern is intended for special handling, this could lead to unintended consequences or bugs in consuming functions or code paths.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `format.width` and `format.height` are assigned values consistent with expected data ranges (typically positive integers). Introduce validation checks in `ccp2_try_format()` function to confirm the handling of negative values explicitly if they are meaningful for certain operations.
