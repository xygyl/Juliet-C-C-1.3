### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses the `strcpy` function to copy a string into a field (`pcm->name`) without verifying whether the destination buffer (`pcm->name`) has sufficient space to store the input string (`name`). This can result in a buffer overflow, which is undefined behavior in C according to the standard.  

### Bug Analysis  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: If the `name` string passed to `snd_bt87x_pcm` is larger than the memory allocated for `pcm->name`, the `strcpy` function will overwrite memory beyond `pcm->name`'s boundary. This could corrupt the program and potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion  
Use a safer alternative to `strcpy`, such as `strncpy`. Specify the maximum size of the `pcm->name` buffer as the size limit to ensure no overflow occurs. For example:

```c
strncpy(pcm->name, name, sizeof(pcm->name) - 1);
pcm->name[sizeof(pcm->name) - 1] = '\0'; // Ensure null termination
```

Additionally, verify that `name` is not `NULL` before calling `strncpy` to avoid dereferencing `NULL` pointers.
