UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate whether `current_ev` surpasses the boundary of `extra + IW_SCAN_MAX_DATA` during multiple `iwe_stream_add_*()` calls. If `current_ev` exceeds this boundary, it can lead to writing beyond the allocated buffer size, which is undefined behavior. Additionally, under certain compiler optimizations, the effective behavior may result in data corruption or crashes.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: Similarly, the unchecked pointer `current_ev` may advance beyond the allocated buffer (`extra + IW_SCAN_MAX_DATA`) due to multiple `iwe_stream_add_event()` and `iwe_stream_add_point()` calls without bounds checking. This can lead to a buffer overflow that corrupts adjacent memory or crashes the program during execution.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Introduce bounds checking logic before each invocation of `iwe_stream_add_event()` and `iwe_stream_add_point()` to ensure `current_ev < extra + IW_SCAN_MAX_DATA`. Ensure proper handling (e.g., stopping processing) in case the buffer limit is exceeded.  

Example Fix:  
```c
if (current_ev + IW_EV_ADDR_LEN >= extra + IW_SCAN_MAX_DATA) {
    break; // Or handle buffer overflow accordingly
}
```
