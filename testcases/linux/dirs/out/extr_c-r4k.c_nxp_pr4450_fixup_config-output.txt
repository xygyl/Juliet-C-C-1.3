UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `_page_cachable_default` variable is used in bitwise calculations, but its initialization or declaration is missing within the scope of the function. If this variable is uninitialized, then this results in undefined behavior due to reading an indeterminate value.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The lack of initialization for the variable `_page_cachable_default` can lead to unintended behavior during the bitwise shift operations and assignment to `config0`. This can result in incorrect memory configuration setup, making the calculations based on this variable invalid.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `_page_cachable_default` is properly initialized with a valid value before being used in the calculations within the function. Add checks or assertions to validate its state if necessary.
