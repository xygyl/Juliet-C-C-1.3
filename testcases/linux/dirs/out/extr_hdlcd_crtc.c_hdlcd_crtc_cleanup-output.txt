Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hdlcd_crtc.c_hdlcd_crtc_cleanup.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `crtc_to_hdlcd_priv` is a type-casting function (presumably converting a `struct drm_crtc` pointer to a `struct hdlcd_drm_private` pointer), but there is no check to ensure the `crtc` pointer passed to it is non-NULL. In cases where `crtc` is NULL, attempting to dereference it within `crtc_to_hdlcd_priv` would invoke undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: If the `crtc` pointer passed to `hdlcd_crtc_cleanup` is NULL, the call to `hdlcd_write` would dereference the `hdlcd` pointer, which would itself be derived from the `NULL` `crtc` pointer. This results in a null pointer dereference.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for a NULL `crtc` pointer at the beginning of `hdlcd_crtc_cleanup`, like this:
```c
if (crtc == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
