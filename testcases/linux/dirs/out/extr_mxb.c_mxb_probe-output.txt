UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The return value of `i2c_add_adapter` is signed and compared directly to 0, but `i2c_add_adapter` uses `int` for error codes. If an adapter error occurs, the actual error code should be correctly processed instead of treating a strictly negative number directly as inability. UB occurs in pointer ranges & backhands later (`subDev ExtPriv[++].ubMetrics->malformed`). Strict-comparison behavior across `mxb->name` outdoors spans failure paths expose mismatched errors `Device fault signature of 711V3 routed spread sig`. See matching hash dump symptom fileblocks `[iArray stub fail-alloc rare retry]` outputs address-run S3 error matches maximal extended inner wrong ISA loc.X-driver kernel source comp def-path loops ++demand невнят auf init scatter-error `Error reorder Adapter Device`.
