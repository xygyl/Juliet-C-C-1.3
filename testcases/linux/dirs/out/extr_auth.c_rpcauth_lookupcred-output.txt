Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_auth.c_rpcauth_lookupcred.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `current_cred()` function, which is called to obtain a pointer to a `cred` structure, may potentially return `NULL`. If `current_cred()` returns `NULL`, the function attempts to assign `NULL` to `acred.cred` and proceeds to pass it to the `lookup_cred` function. Depending on the implementation of `lookup_cred`, dereferencing this pointer could lead to undefined behavior.
  
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If `current_cred()` returns `NULL`, the code does not check for this possibility. It directly assigns this value to `acred.cred` and passes the structure to the `lookup_cred` function, which may dereference the pointer, leading to a null pointer dereference at runtime.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for `NULL` after calling `current_cred()` and before populating the `auth_cred` structure. You could return an error or handle the case explicitly to ensure the pointer is valid before proceeding. For example:

```c
if (!cred) {
    return NULL; // Or handle the error appropriately
}
```
