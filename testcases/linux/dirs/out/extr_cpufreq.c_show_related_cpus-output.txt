Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cpufreq.c_show_related_cpus.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The struct pointer `policy` is used without a prior check for `NULL`. If the function is called with `policy == NULL`, dereferencing `policy->related_cpus` results in undefined behavior (null pointer dereference).  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: Dereferencing `policy` without validating whether it is `NULL` can lead to runtime crashes if `policy` is not properly initialized or passed as `NULL`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a `NULL` check for the `policy` pointer at the start of the function. For example:
```c
if (policy == NULL)
    return -EINVAL;  // Return an appropriate error code.
```
