Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vht.c_ieee80211_apply_vhtcap_overrides.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function contains a signed left shift operation (`n << IEEE80211_VHT_CAP_MAX_A_MPDU_LENGTH_EXPONENT_SHIFT`) where unsigned values are not guaranteed. If `n` exceeds a certain bit-width limit, it may result in undefined behavior due to signed integer overflow. Also, `le16_to_cpu()` and/or `cpu_to_le16()` routines may assume arbitrary endianness in contexts generating misaligned behaviors.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic issues and data corruption risk.  
Bug Reason: There is insufficient error handling for boundary conditions where shifts could exceed type limits or signed-incorrect with 2 interpretations cases mapped differentially endianness.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Use `unsigned ` implementation containing error-check safeness size limits .  
Alternative asserts validatorsamineness legality before variances substring bytes.
