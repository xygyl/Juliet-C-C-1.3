UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing `skt->nr` before verifying if `skt` is a valid (non-NULL) pointer is undefined behavior. Dereferencing a NULL pointer is UB.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not verify that `skt` is a non-NULL pointer before dereferencing its members. If `skt` is NULL, the dereference in `skt->nr` and other member accesses will result in a null pointer dereference bug.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to validate `skt` before dereferencing it, for example:  
```c
if (!skt) {
    return -EINVAL; // or other appropriate error code
}
```
