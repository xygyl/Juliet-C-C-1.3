UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Division by zero may occur if the `percent` parameter is equal to 0. According to the C standard, division by zero leads to undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: No validation is performed on the `percent` parameter to ensure it's non-zero before performing the division. This can lead to a crash or undefined behavior during runtime.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `percent` is non-zero before invoking the `div_ext_fp` function. For example:  

```c
static inline int32_t percent_ext_fp(int percent)
{
    if (percent == 0) {
        // Handle the zero case
        return 0;  // Or an appropriate value to represent the error.
    }
    return div_ext_fp(percent, 100);
}
```
