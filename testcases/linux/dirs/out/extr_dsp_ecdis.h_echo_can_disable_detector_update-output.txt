UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential signed integer overflow/underflow in calculations using `abs(amp)` and `abs(notched)` combined with assignments like `det->channel_level += ((abs(amp) - det->channel_level) >> 5)`. Signed integer overflow in C is undefined behavior as defined by the standard. This is particularly relevant since the function `abs()` operates on `int`, and no explicit range validity checks are performed for `amp` or `notched`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The calculations for `det->channel_level` and `det->notch_level` assume that subtraction and bit-shifting operations will not corrupt values (potentially leading to undefined behavior) and do not account for cases where `abs()` overflows. This results in unreliable energy estimation and discrimination of tones and noise. Furthermore, the logic for determining whether `det->hit` should be set (`if (det->good_cycles > 2) det->hit = TRUE;`) does not anticipate scenarios where `good_cycles` gets reset unexpectedly due to ambiguous energy conditions, causing false negatives.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Validate `amp` and `notched` values before using `abs()` to ensure they fall within the expected range for `int`. Alternatively, use a wider type like `long` to reduce overflow risk (if possible given the context).
2. Carefully review energy damping calculations to prevent signed overflow and unnecessary resets of `tone_cycle_duration` and `det->good_cycles`.
3. Add data validation and bounds-checking to ensure the calculation logic is robust for edge cases.
