Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_iommu.c_iommu_group_remove_file.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Possible dereference of null pointers `group` or `attr`, both of which are passed as parameters to the function without any validation for null values. If either pointer is null, undefined behavior will occur when attempting to access their members.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If `group` or `attr` is null, the dereference operations (`group->kobj` or `attr->attr`) will lead to a null pointer dereference, which typically causes a runtime crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer checks at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!group || !attr) {
    return;
}
```
