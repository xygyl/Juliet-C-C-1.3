Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_msgqueue.c_msgqueue_initialise.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The statement `msgq->entries[i].next = &msgq->entries[i + 1];` accesses `msgq->entries[i + 1]`, which is out of bounds for the last iteration (i.e., when `i == NR_MESSAGES - 1`). Dereferencing an out-of-bounds array element is undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: In the last iteration of the loop (`i == NR_MESSAGES - 1`), `msgq->entries[i + 1]` goes out of bounds, causing an invalid write or memory corruption. This logic flaw would lead to runtime errors or crashes depending on memory layout and allocation status.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Adjust the loop condition or explicitly handle the last assignment outside the loop. For example:
```c
for (i = 0; i < NR_MESSAGES - 1; i++)
    msgq->entries[i].next = &msgq->entries[i + 1];

msgq->entries[NR_MESSAGES - 1].next = NULL;
```
