Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_i5400_edac.c_from_nf_ferr.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: **Signed integer overflow** could occur due to left shift operation `(1 << 28)` if `int` on the platform is 32 bits wide, making `1 << 28` exceed the signed range for `int`. Undefined behavior results from signed integer overflow according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer overflow  
Bug Reason: Same as UB. The logic assumes the left-shift `(1 << 28)` results in a correct value for further operations, but on platforms where `int` is 32 bits, signed overflow alters the result unpredictably. Moreover, the masking operation `(mask & ((1 << 28) - 1) << 3)` could result in an incorrect calculation due to misalignment caused by overflow.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Change `(1 << 28)` to `(1UL << 28)` to ensure the left-shift is performed on an `unsigned long`, avoiding signed integer overflow and UB. Updated code:  

```c
static inline int from_nf_ferr(unsigned int mask)
{
	return (mask & EMASK_M29) |		/* Bit 28 */
	       (mask & ((1UL << 28) - 1) << 3);	/* Bits 0 to 27 */
}
```
