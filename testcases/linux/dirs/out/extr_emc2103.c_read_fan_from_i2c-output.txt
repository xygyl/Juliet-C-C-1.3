### **UB Analysis**
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not check whether the pointer `output` is `NULL` before dereferencing it (`*output = ...`). If `output` is `NULL`, dereferencing it results in undefined behavior as per the C standard.
  
### **Bug Analysis**
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `output` is passed as `NULL` and the control flow reaches the line `*output = ((u16)high_byte << 5) | (lo_byte >> 3);`, a null pointer dereference occurs. This is a likely flaw because callers might inadvertently or unknowingly pass a `NULL` pointer to this parameter.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

### **Fix Suggestion**
Add a `NULL` check for the `output` pointer at the start of the function:
```c
if (!output)
    return;
```
This ensures that the function does not attempt to dereference a `NULL` pointer.

Alternatively, document that the caller must ensure `output` is non-NULL and assert its validity:
```c
assert(output != NULL);
```
