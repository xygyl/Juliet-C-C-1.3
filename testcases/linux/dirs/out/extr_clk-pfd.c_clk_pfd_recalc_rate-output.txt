UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The division operation in `do_div(tmp, frac)` is a potential source of undefined behavior when `frac` is evaluated as 0 due to the lack of a check for `frac == 0`. Division by zero is undefined behavior in the C language and may lead to unpredictable results or program crashes.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The dependency on `frac` as the divisor without validating its value creates an error condition when `frac == 0`. A logic error arises since no safeguard prevents division by zero, making the function fail at runtime if this condition occurs.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a condition to check if `frac` is zero before performing the division. For example:
```c
if (frac == 0)
    return 0; // Return a safe default value or handle the error appropriately
```
This prevents division by zero and avoids undefined behavior while maintaining program stability.
