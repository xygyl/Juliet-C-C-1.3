UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences the `arg` pointer without performing null-checks to ensure it is not `NULL`. If `arg` is `NULL`, dereferencing it to access `p->type` will result in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: A null pointer dereference can occur due to the lack of null-checking for `arg`. If `arg` is passed as `NULL`, accessing its members (`p->type`) will cause a runtime error.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null-check for `arg` at the beginning of the function to ensure it is not `NULL` before dereferencing it. For example:
```c
if (!arg) {
    return -EINVAL; // Error code indicating invalid argument
}
```
