### UB Analysis ###
UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The code does not invoke undefined behavior under the C standard. There is no evidence of null or invalid pointer dereferences, uninitialized variable usage, out-of-bounds accesses, misaligned memory operations, or violations of strict aliasing rules. Signed integer overflow is unlikely as the operations are limited to assignments and function calls.

### Bug Analysis ###
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason:
1. **Improper atomic decrement in case of `reserve_pmc_hardware()` failure**: 
   - If `reserve_pmc_hardware()` fails (line 22), the function decrements `riscv_active_events` using `atomic_dec`. However, this atomic decrement assumes that the corresponding atomic increment (`atomic_inc_return`) occurred before. In scenarios where a race condition causes another thread/process to invoke this function at the wrong time, the decrement may unintentionally lower the counter more than necessary, leading to improper tracking of `riscv_active_events`.

2. **Potential race condition**: Concurrent access to `riscv_active_events` without proper synchronization could lead to unpredictable behavior when multiple threads are incrementing or decrementing the variable simultaneously.

Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion ###
1. **Safeguard atomic decrement**: Add a conditional check or synchronization mechanism to ensure that the atomic decrement operation is valid and aligned with the previous increment operation.
   ```c
   if (atomic_read(&riscv_active_events) > 0)
       atomic_dec(&riscv_active_events);
   ```

2. **Ensure thread safety** for the management of `riscv_active_events`. Use locks or another synchronization mechanism to coordinate access to this shared resource in multithreaded environments.

3. **Improve error handling for mapping events**:
   - Before invoking `event->destroy(event)` (line 37), consider whether cleanup operations could impact shared resources or lead to unintended side effects. For example:
     ```c
     if (code < 0) {
         if (atomic_read(&riscv_active_events) > 0)
             atomic_dec(&riscv_active_events);
         event->destroy(event);
         return code;
     }
     ```
