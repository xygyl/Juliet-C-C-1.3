Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_thinkpad_acpi.c_mute_led_init.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code potentially uses uninitialized variables. Specifically, the array `mute_led_cdev` seems to be indexed by `i`, but there is no guarantee that its elements are initialized before use, particularly its `brightness` member. Accessing an uninitialized variable can cause undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-Related Bug
Bug Reason: The code fails to properly clean up allocated resources on error paths. Specifically, if `led_classdev_register` fails at some index `i`, the `while (i--)` loop will unregister entries, but the loop continues to index `mute_led_cdev` array for elements that are uninitialized or potentially invalid. This may lead to invalid memory access or double deallocations depending on the larger application logic outside this function.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Initialize all elements of the `mute_led_cdev` array before using them.
2. Ensure any potential cleanup handles only correctly registered class devices (e.g., track successful registrations separately or introduce additional state management for `mute_led_cdev` indices).
3. Validate the size of the `mute_led_cdev` array to guarantee it aligns with the constant `TPACPI_LED_MAX`.
