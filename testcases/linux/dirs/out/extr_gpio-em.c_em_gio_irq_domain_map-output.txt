Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_gpio-em.c_em_gio_irq_domain_map.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The operation `(int)hwirq` assumes that `irq_hw_number_t` (which is defined as `scalar_t__` and potentially platform-dependent) can be safely cast to `int`. If `hwirq` has a value outside the range of representable values for an `int` on this platform, this causes undefined behavior due to integer truncation.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Bug
Bug Reason: It is unclear whether assumptions regarding `hwirq` being representable as `int` are correct. This could lead to incorrect logging or misinterpretation of the input when debugging, especially if `hwirq` holds values that overflow the `int` range.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Replace `(int)hwirq` with an appropriate type-safe formatter or cast that ensures correctness on all platforms. For instance, use `%ld` and cast `hwirq` to `long` if `scalar_t__` is understood to be `long`. Alternatively, ensure `irq_hw_number_t` is always safely representable as `int` across all platforms.

Example Fix:
```c
pr_debug("gio: map hw irq = %ld, irq = %d\n", (long)hwirq, irq);
```
