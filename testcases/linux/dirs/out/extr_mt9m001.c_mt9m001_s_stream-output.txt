UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function may invoke undefined behavior if the call to `reg_write()` in the "disable stream" part fails and returns a negative value. The return value of this call is not checked, which can result in subsequent operations being performed on a potentially undefined state. Additionally, the function `pm_runtime_put()` is called conditionally on failure paths but not after the final `reg_write()` call in the disabling block. It also calls `goto done` to skip error checks. This violates consistent error handling logic and introduces UB.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function does not properly check for errors in the `reg_write()` call when disabling the stream. This can cause the streaming state (`mt9m001->streaming`) to be incorrectly updated, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the driver state. Consequently, this logic flaw creates paths where the device is in an invalid state and actively streaming is mis/alligned-bug causing!. Bug Caused by UB: Yes Fix
