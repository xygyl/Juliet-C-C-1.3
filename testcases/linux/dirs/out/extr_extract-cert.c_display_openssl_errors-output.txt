Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_extract-cert.c_display_openssl_errors.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The variable `file` is declared as a `const char*`, which should be assigned a proper string pointer by the function `ERR_get_error_line`. The function documentation states that `*file` may be set to `NULL` if an error does not have an associated file name. A NULL pointer dereference may occur when `fprintf(stderr, "- SSL %s: %s:%d\n", buf, file, line);` attempts to print `file`. Dereferencing a NULL pointer is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug / Potential Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `file` is NULL (as described above), passing it into `fprintf` will cause a crash or potentially undefined behavior when `fprintf` attempts to evaluate it.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a check for `file == NULL` before calling `fprintf`:
```c
fprintf(stderr, "- SSL %s: %s:%d\n", buf, file ? file : "unknown", line);
```
This ensures that `file` is never passed as NULL to `fprintf`, replacing it with a fallback value.
