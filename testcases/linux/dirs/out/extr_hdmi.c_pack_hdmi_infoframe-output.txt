UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate the input `raw_frame` or its length `len`, which can lead to out-of-bounds array access (read beyond the limits of the array). This triggers undefined behavior if `len` is greater than the actual size of `raw_frame`. Additionally, accessing elements from `raw_frame` without ensuring that `raw_frame` is not a `NULL` pointer can result in a null pointer dereference, which is also undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Over-read and Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `len` exceeds the size of `raw_frame`, the function reads past the bounds of `raw_frame`, causing a buffer over-read. This is a memory-related bug. Furthermore, if `raw_frame` is `NULL` and the function attempts to access its elements, a null pointer dereference will occur.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Validate both the pointer `raw_frame` and the `len` input at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!raw_frame || len < 0 || len > MAX_FRAME_SIZE) {
    // Handle invalid input, e.g., return an error or default values
    return;
}
```
`MAX_FRAME_SIZE` should represent the maximum expected size of the HDMI frame (likely 17 bytes here). This ensures safe access within bounds and prevents null pointer dereference.
