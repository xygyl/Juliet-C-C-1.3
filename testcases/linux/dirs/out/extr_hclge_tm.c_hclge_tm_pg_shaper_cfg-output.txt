Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hclge_tm.c_hclge_tm_pg_shaper_cfg.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing potentially uninitialized variables `ir_b`, `ir_u`, `ir_s` in `hclge_tm_pg_shaper_cfg()` may result in undefined behavior. If `hclge_shaper_para_calc()` fails (`ret != 0`), these variables are not set before usage in `hclge_tm_get_shapping_para()`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: Logic flaw causes invalid values of potentially uninitialized variables (`ir_b`, `ir_u`, `ir_s`) to be used in `hclge_tm_pg_shapping_cfg()`. This may result in incorrect shaper configuration or runtime errors depending on implementation of `hclge_tm_get_shapping_para()`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Ensure variables `ir_b`, `ir_u`, `ir_s` are properly initialized or checked before being used when `hclge_shaper_para_calc()` fails. For instance:
```c
if (ret) {
    return ret;
}
// Ensure ir_b, ir_u, ir_s are initialized before invoking hclge_tm_get_shapping_para().
```  
Alternatively, add a fallback initialization for these variables to handle error conditions gracefully.
