UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences the pointer `prod` without validating if it is `NULL`. This can lead to undefined behavior if `prod` is passed as `NULL`. Additionally, if the pointer `idx` is passed as `NULL`, dereferencing `*idx` also results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: The implementation does not ensure the pointers `prod` and `idx` are non-NULL before dereferencing them. If either pointer is `NULL`, it leads to a runtime crash or undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
- Add checks for `prod` and `idx` at the beginning of the function to ensure they are not `NULL`. For example:  
```c
if (!prod || !idx) {
    return 0;  // Or handle the error appropriately.
}
```
