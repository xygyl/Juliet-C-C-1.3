UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences `config_regs`, assuming it is always valid. However, this pointer is passed as an argument without proper validation or guarantees, and calling the function with `cac_config_regs == NULL` will lead to undefined behavior since the pointer is dereferenced before the `NULL` check (`config_regs == NULL`) inside the loop condition.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If the caller passes `cac_config_regs` as `NULL`, the dereference in the while loop will cause a null pointer dereference runtime bug.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a guard clause at the start of the function to check for `NULL` before any dereference:

```c
if (cac_config_regs == NULL) {
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
```
