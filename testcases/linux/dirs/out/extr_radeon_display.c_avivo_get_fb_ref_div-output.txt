Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_radeon_display.c_avivo_get_fb_ref_div.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The division `den / post_div` and `100 / post_div` may lead to undefined behavior if `post_div` is zero. Division by zero is undefined behavior in C. Additionally, in `(*ref_div * fb_div_max) / (*fb_div)` and `DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST(nom * *ref_div * post_div, den)`, any division involving zero values for denominator also results in undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: There is no explicit validation or check to ensure that `post_div` or `den` is non-zero before performing divisions (`den / post_div`, `100 / post_div`, etc.). This oversight can lead to a crash due to division by zero during runtime if zero values are passed.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit checks to verify that `post_div` and `den` are not zero before performing any division operations. For example, include guards like:  
```c
if (post_div == 0 || den == 0) {
    // Handle error or abort execution
    return;
}
```  
This ensures safe behavior and prevents undefined behavior and resulting bugs.
