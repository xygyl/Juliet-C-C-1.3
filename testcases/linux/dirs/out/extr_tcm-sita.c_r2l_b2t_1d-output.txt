### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
**UB Reason:**  
1. **Unsigned Integer Underflow:**  
   The computation `*pos = bit - w` may result in an unsigned integer underflow when `bit < w`. This occurs because `unsigned long` subtraction wraps around in an unsigned manner, causing potentially large unintended values. This violates logical expectations and can lead to UB-related outcomes.  
2. **Out-of-Bounds Access:**  
   The `bitmap_set(map, *pos, w)` function assumes `*pos` and `*pos + w` are valid indices within `map`. If computed `*pos` is out of bounds due to the unsigned underflow mentioned above, memory access violations may occur.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
**Bug Type:** Logic flaw  
**Bug Reason:**  
The algorithm wrongly calculates `search_count` as `num_bits - bit + w`, which does not properly track the total number of bits searched. Additionally, the unsigned integer underflow from the subtraction `*pos = bit - w` can lead to erroneous behavior, such as incorrect mapping or prematurely terminating the search.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Prevent unsigned integer underflow:
   Check explicitly that `bit >= w` before performing `*pos = bit - w`.

   ```c
   if (bit >= w)
       *pos = bit - w;
   else
       break; // Exit loop or handle error
   ```

2. Validate bounds before accessing `map` in `bitmap_set`:
   ```c
   if (*pos + w <= num_bits) {
       bitmap_set(map, *pos, w);
   } else {
       return -ENOMEM; // Return error for out-of-bounds access
   }
   ```

3. Correct logic for `search_count`:
   Ensure `search_count` properly tracks the number of bits searched in a linear fashion instead of using the faulty formula `search_count = num_bits - bit + w`.
