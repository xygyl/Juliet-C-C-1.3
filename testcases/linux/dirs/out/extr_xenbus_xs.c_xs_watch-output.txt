### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
The function contains an implicit violation of strict aliasing rules due to the casting of `path` and `token` from `const char*` to `void *`. According to the C standard, accessing an object through a pointer of a different type (except for certain cases like `char*` or `void*`) can result in undefined behavior. Additionally, there is a potential for undefined behavior if `path` or `token` is a `NULL` pointer since `strlen(NULL)` is undefined.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason:  
The function does not check whether `path` or `token` is `NULL` before calling `strlen(path)` and `strlen(token)`. If either `path` or `token` is `NULL`, a null pointer dereference will occur when `strlen()` attempts to access memory via the invalid pointer. This can lead to a segmentation fault.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:   
1. Add a validation check to ensure `path` and `token` are not `NULL` before proceeding:  
```c
if (!path || !token) {
    return -EINVAL; // or another appropriate error code
}
```

2. Rework the function to avoid casting `const char*` to `void*`, ensuring compliance with strict aliasing rules.
