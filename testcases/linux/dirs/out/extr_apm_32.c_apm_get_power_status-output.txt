Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_apm_32.c_apm_get_power_status.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function potentially dereferences null pointers `status`, `bat`, and `life` without checking if they are valid (non-NULL) before assignment. This constitutes undefined behavior per the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If any of the pointers `status`, `bat`, or `life` are passed as NULL, the assignments `*status = call.ebx;`, `*bat = call.ecx;`, or `*life = ...` would result in undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate the input pointers (`status`, `bat`, `life`) at the beginning of the function using checks like `if (status == NULL || bat == NULL || life == NULL) return APM_32_UNSUPPORTED;`. Alternatively, document their usage explicitly and state that passing NULL is not allowed.
