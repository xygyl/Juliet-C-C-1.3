Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_modpost.c_new_symbol.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function assumes that the result of `alloc_symbol` is always non-NULL and immediately dereferences it (`new->module` and `new->export`). If `alloc_symbol` returns NULL (e.g., due to a failed memory allocation), then dereferencing `new` results in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The dereferencing of `new` (`new->module` and `new->export`) without validating that `alloc_symbol` succeeded can lead to runtime crashes if `alloc_symbol` fails to allocate memory and returns NULL.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL check for `new` (the return value of `alloc_symbol`) before dereferencing it. For example:
```c
if (!new) {
    return NULL; // Or handle the error appropriately.
}
```
This ensures no dereference occurs if memory allocation fails and `alloc_symbol` returns NULL.
