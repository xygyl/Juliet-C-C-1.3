UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potentially undefined behavior arises from the use of the macro `smc_curs_diff` without ensuring that the difference does not result in negative values or scenarios that might lead to invalid pointer arithmetic. In particular, pointer operations could result in either an overflow or underflow if the computation of differences goes beyond valid indices. Depending on the runtime state, not validating `conn->urg_curs` or `conn->local_tx_ctrl.cons` before their usage could lead to violations of memory safety rules. Additionally, integer alignment towards invalidity within sequence load.  

Bug Detected: Yeess alongside.
