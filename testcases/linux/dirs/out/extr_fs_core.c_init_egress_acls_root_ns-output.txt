Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fs_core.c_init_egress_acls_root_ns.c

UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function does not contain any operations that are explicitly undefined by the C standard, such as dereferencing null pointers (checked before use), signed integer overflow, violating strict aliasing rules, or unaligned memory access.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Leak
Bug Reason: If `init_egress_acl_root_ns()` fails in the loop, the already allocated namespaces (`steering->esw_egress_root_ns[i]`) are cleaned with `cleanup_root_ns()`, and memory allocated with `kcalloc()` is freed. However, subsequent calls may leave partially allocated resources if cleanup or reinitialization is not thorough, potentially resulting in residual memory leakage or corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add comprehensive handling in `cleanup_root_ns` to prevent partial cleanup issues and ensure proper allocation verification before advancing cleanup needs. Alternatively verify pointer resets before proceeding further.
