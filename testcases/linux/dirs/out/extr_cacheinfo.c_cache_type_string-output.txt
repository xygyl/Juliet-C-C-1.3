Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cacheinfo.c_cache_type_string.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds access on the `cache_type_info` array. The `cache->type` value is used as an index into `cache_type_info` without bounds-checking. If `cache->type` is greater than the number of elements in `cache_type_info`, it leads to undefined behavior as array indexing beyond valid bounds is UB in C.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The lack of bounds-checking on `cache->type` may result in incorrect or invalid memory access. This could lead to crashes or unintended behavior if `cache->type` is set to an invalid index value.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds-checking for `cache->type` before accessing `cache_type_info`. For example, ensure `cache->type` is less than the total number of elements in the `cache_type_info` array.
