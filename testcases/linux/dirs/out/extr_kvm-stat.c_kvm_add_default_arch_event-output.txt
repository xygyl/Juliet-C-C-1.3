UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. Potential dereference of uninitialized `argv[j++]` if `argv[j]` is accessed without ensuring if `j` index is valid relative to `argv` size.  
2. `strdup()` may return `NULL`, which is subsequently dereferenced as `argv[j++]`, causing undefined behavior if memory allocation fails.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Leak  
Bug Reason:  
1. If `pmu_have_event()` doesn't return true, the allocated memory for `tmp` is not freed completely if `tmp[i]` contains contents allocated in strdup.  
2. Memory allocated by `strdup()` in `argv[j++]` is not freed before the function exits, leading to a memory leak.
