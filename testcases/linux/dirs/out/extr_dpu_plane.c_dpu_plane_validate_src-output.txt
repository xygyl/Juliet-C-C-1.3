### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain any operations that result in undefined behavior according to the C standard. Pointer arithmetic is avoided, only comparisons and function calls are used, and basic type safety is respected. There are no issues such as dereferencing invalid pointers, accessing out-of-bounds memory, or violating strict-aliasing rules.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The logic used to ensure `src` is fully encapsulated within `fb_rect` is flawed. The function uses `drm_rect_intersect(fb_rect, src)` and checks equality using `drm_rect_equals(fb_rect, src)`. The `drm_rect_intersect()` function appears to modify one or both of the rectangles during the intersection operation (this is typical for an intersection routine where the resulting rectangle may overwrite the input). If it does modify these rectangles, the equality check with `drm_rect_equals()` afterward will likely fail to produce correct results, which may lead to false negatives.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  

### Fix Suggestions:
1. Confirm the behavior of `drm_rect_intersect()` to verify whether it modifies input rectangles. If it does:
    - Store the results of `drm_rect_intersect()` into a temporary rectangle and use that for the equality check with `drm_rect_equals()`. For example:
      ```c
      struct drm_rect temp_rect = *src;
      if (drm_rect_intersect(fb_rect, &temp_rect) && drm_rect_equals(fb_rect, &temp_rect))
          return true;
      return false;
      ```
2. If `drm_rect_intersect()` does not modify its inputs, ensure the function logic accounts for proper rectangle containment checks.

This fix ensures the validation logic properly verifies the encapsulation of `src` within `fb_rect`.
