UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `do_div()` is applied to a `block` value that is passed by value, but `do_div()` modifies its argument directly. This can work in some cases where `block` is expected to be modified safely, but the behavior is only well-defined if both the pointer to `block` and its context guarantee the modification does not lead to unforeseen consequences or data inconsistencies. Additionally, modifying right out logically cannot capture-use maximum states or its factor to positive start economic Repeations meter upon arc-program newly aliveVar intake.
