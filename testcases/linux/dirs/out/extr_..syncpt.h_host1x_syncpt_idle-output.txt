UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Dereferencing a member pointer (`sp->min_val` and `sp->max_val`) in `atomic_read`, without verifying that `sp` is non-NULL. If `sp` is ever NULL, this results in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If the function is called with a NULL `sp` pointer, `sp->min_val` will cause loading memory from a NULL pointer, leading to undefined behavior and a crash at runtime.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL check for the `sp` pointer before accessing its members:
```c
if (!sp) return false;
```
Alternatively, document explicitly that the caller must ensure `sp` is non-NULL.
