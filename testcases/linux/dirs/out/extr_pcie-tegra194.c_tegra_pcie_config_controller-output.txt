UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing invalid pointers in two cases: (1) `pcie->dbi_res->start` and (2) `pcie->atu_dma_res->start`, without verifying whether pointers `pcie->dbi_res` and `pcie->atu_dma_res` are null. If any of these are null, dereferencing them leads to undefined behavior. Furthermore, potential usage of an unverified pointer `pcie->pex_ctl_supply` violates safe-memory access rules when passed to `regulator_enable`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `pcie->dbi_res`, `pcie->atu_dma_res`, and `pcie->pex_ctl_supply` are non-null, but does not perform upfront checks or validations to ensure this. If any of them are null, dereferencing them will cause a null pointer dereference error. Additionally, lack of checks for the success of `reset_control_deassert(pcie->core_rst)` introduces a logic bug where the system could enter an undefined state after failing to assert this reset control.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add null pointer checks for members of `struct tegra_pcie_dw *pcie`, such as `dbi_res`, `atu_dma_res`, `pex_ctl_supply`, and `core_rst`, at the start of the function. Example:  

```c
if (!pcie || !pcie->dbi_res || !pcie->atu_dma_res || !pcie->pex_ctl_supply || !pcie->core_rst) {
    dev_err(pcie->dev, "Invalid pcie configuration or null member encountered\n");
    return -EINVAL;
}
```

2. After calling `reset_control_deassert(pcie->core_rst)`, check for errors and handle appropriately:
```c
ret = reset_control_deassert(pcie->core_rst);
if (ret) {
    dev_err(pcie->dev, "Failed to deassert core reset: %d\n", ret);
    // Ensure proper cleanup or fallback mechanism
    return ret;
}
```
These fixes will ensure the code is resilient against null pointer dereferences and avoids undefined memory states.
