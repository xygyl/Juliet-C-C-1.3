UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function assumes that `req_cnt` is less than or equal to 5 without proper bounds checking on `req`. If `req_cnt` is valid but `req` has fewer than 5 elements (or if the pointer `req` is invalid), it leads to dereferencing invalid memory, causing undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Invalid memory access / Array index out of bounds
Bug Reason: The function accesses `req` elements `req[0]` through `req[4]` without ensuring that the `req` array has at least 5 elements available. If `req_cnt` is less than 5, accessing uninitialized elements or out-of-bounds memory could result.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a validation step to ensure that the array `req` has at least `req_cnt` elements before accessing `req[0]` through `req[4]`. Alternatively, iterate through `req` based on the value of `req_cnt` to avoid accessing indices beyond the provided count.

Example fix:
```c
int __qcom_scm_hdcp_req(struct device *dev, struct qcom_scm_hdcp_req *req,
			u32 req_cnt, u32 *resp)
{
	int ret;
	struct qcom_scm_desc desc = {0};
	struct arm_smccc_res res;

	if (req_cnt > QCOM_SCM_HDCP_MAX_REQ_CNT)
		return -ERANGE;

	/* Validate the number of requests in the array */
	if (!req || req_cnt == 0)
		return -ERANGE;

	for (u32 i = 0; i < req_cnt; ++i) {
		desc.args[2 * i] = req[i].addr;
		desc.args[2 * i + 1] = req[i].val;
	}
	desc.arginfo = QCOM_SCM_ARGS(req_cnt * 2);

	ret = qcom_scm_call(dev, QCOM_SCM_SVC_HDCP, QCOM_SCM_CMD_HDCP, &desc,
			    &res);
	*resp = res.a1;

	return ret;
}
```
