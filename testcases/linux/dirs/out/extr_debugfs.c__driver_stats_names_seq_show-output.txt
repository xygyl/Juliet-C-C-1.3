Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_debugfs.c__driver_stats_names_seq_show.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Indirect access of an array (`hfi1_statnames`) using unsanitized index (`*spos`) could lead to undefined behavior if the index is out of bounds. The C standard does not define behavior for out-of-bound array access.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The `*spos` variable is used directly as an index to the `hfi1_statnames` array without verification. If `*spos` is out of range, this will result in an illegal memory access and likely cause a crash or corruption.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add validation for the index (`*spos`) to ensure it is within the bounds of `hfi1_statnames`. For example:
```c
if (*spos < 0 || *spos >= ARRAY_SIZE(hfi1_statnames)) {
    return -EINVAL; // Or handle the error appropriately.
}
seq_printf(s, "%s\n", hfi1_statnames[*spos]);
```
Make sure `ARRAY_SIZE` is a macro defined for calculating the size of the `hfi1_statnames` array.
