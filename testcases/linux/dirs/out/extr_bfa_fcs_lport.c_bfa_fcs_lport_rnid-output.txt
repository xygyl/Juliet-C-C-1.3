UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The variable `gen_topo_data` is used unconditionally inside the call to `fc_rnid_acc_build()` if `rnid->node_id_data_format != RNID_NODEID_DATA_FORMAT_DISCOVERY`. However, in this case, `gen_topo_data` is not initialized. Reading from an uninitialized variable is undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The function does not properly initialize the `gen_topo_data` structure when the data format is not discovery (`RNID_NODEID_DATA_FORMAT_COMMON` branch). This could lead to erroneous data being sent or undefined behavior due to uninitialized values in the structure.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Always initialize `gen_topo_data` with a default value or perform a safer conditional handling to ensure it is properly initialized before being passed to `fc_rnid_acc_build()`.
