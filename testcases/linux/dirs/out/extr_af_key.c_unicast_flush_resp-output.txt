UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The cast of `sizeof(struct sadb_msg) / sizeof(uint64_t)` to `hdr->sadb_msg_len`, may result in truncation if the result is larger than what can be represented in the target datatype. The safe range violates here possibly is hardware might have a set base divided_ALIGN_ALLOC.However largelly libraries handled`

Bug Type<Search_cursor->maximum allocative(BAD_FIXED)--mem_boradc)
Bug Detected:NI
