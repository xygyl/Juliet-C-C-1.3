UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing `ufds[i].epd->anon` without verifying whether `ufds[i].epd` is a NULL pointer leads to undefined behavior. Dereferencing a NULL pointer results in undefined behavior according to the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `ufds[i].epd` is NULL, dereferencing `ufds[i].epd->anon` will cause a segmentation fault. There is no check to ensure `ufds[i].epd` is valid before dereferencing it.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before accessing `ufds[i].epd->anon`, add a null-check for `ufds[i].epd`. Example:
```c
if (ufds[i].epd == NULL) {
    ufds[i].revents = EPOLLERR | EPOLLHUP;
    continue;
}
```
