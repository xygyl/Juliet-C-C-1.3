UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses and manipulates elements of the `eui` array (indexes `0`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and slices such as `&eui[6]`) without verifying that the array has sufficient size to accommodate these operations. If the array `eui` is shorter than 8 bytes, this results in potential out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The function uses the `eui` array without validating its size, potentially causing a buffer overflow when accessing or modifying indices up to `eui[6]` assuming the array has fewer than 8 elements. This is a critical bug since it can corrupt memory and cause unexpected program behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that the `eui` array has at least 8 bytes before performing any operations involving array indexing or slicing. This could be achieved using an explicit size parameter passed to the function or with assertions/checks inside the function.
