UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain undefined behavior. All pointer operations are safe, no uninitialized variables are used, and arithmetic operations (such as `1 << nr` and bitwise manipulations) are not subject to overflow or out-of-bounds issues within context.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the value of `nr` against any maximum or expected range, potentially leading to improper manipulation of `data->fan_beep` using out-of-bounds shifts (`1 << nr`). If `nr` exceeds the width of the target integer type (typically 32 or 64 bits), the behavior of the shift is well-defined in this context due to modular arithmetic on the shift operand, but it can lead to incorrect functioning or even unintended changes to unrelated bits. Additionally, `nr` not being validated as a reasonable fan index could lead to silent errors.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate `nr` against the maximum supported number of fans before using it in shift operations. For example:

```c
#define MAX_FANS 32  // Example maximum number of fans supported
if (nr < 0 || nr >= MAX_FANS) 
    return -EINVAL;  // Return invalid argument error
```

Optionally, ensure that `val` is a boolean (0 or 1) as required by the logic. For example:

```c
if (val != 0 && val != 1) 
    return -EINVAL;
``` 

This would improve robustness and maintain code correctness.
