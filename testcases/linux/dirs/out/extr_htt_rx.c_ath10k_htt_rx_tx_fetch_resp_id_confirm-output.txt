UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: This function adheres to the C standard and does not exhibit undefined behavior. Specifically:
- The array `resp_ids` is accessed safely via `resp_ids[i]`. There is an implicit assumption that there are at least `num_resp_ids` entries in `resp_ids`, but the provided code does not explicitly violate this assumption.
- Signed integer overflow is avoided as no signed arithmetic operations are performed.
- The function does not dereference any null or invalid pointers, nor does it access uninitialized variables.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory management issue (logic flaw)  
Bug Reason: The loop suggests that some form of memory cleanup for `resp_id` is required ("TODO: free resp_id"). However, this cleanup is not implemented, leading to a potential memory leak or deferred resource management issue. The lack of freeing, if expected behavior, could lead to increased memory usage or undefined behavior after the function invocation elsewhere in the system.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: If `resp_id` represents a dynamically allocated resource that requires explicit cleanup, implement the appropriate resource deallocation inside the loop. For example:  
```c
// Assuming resp_id points to dynamically allocated memory or similar resource:
free(resp_id);  
```
Alternatively, clarify in comments whether "TODO: free resp_id" is a placeholder for future work or unnecessary in the current implementation.
