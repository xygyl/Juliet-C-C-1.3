### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
- **Dereferencing an invalid pointer:** If `kzalloc` fails (returns `NULL` due to an out-of-memory condition), the function proceeds to dereference `cstate->base` via `__drm_atomic_helper_crtc_reset(crtc, &cstate->base);`, which results in undefined behavior.  
- The code does not check whether `kzalloc` successfully allocated memory before using the pointer. This violates the requirement to ensure that memory allocation functions successfully return a valid pointer.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory allocation failure handling.  
Bug Reason:  
- The absence of a `NULL` check on `cstate` after calling `kzalloc` could lead to a crash if the system runs out of memory. This is a functional bug caused by not validating the result of `kzalloc`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Add a `NULL` check after calling `kzalloc`:
```c
static void dpu_crtc_reset(struct drm_crtc *crtc)
{
    struct dpu_crtc_state *cstate = kzalloc(sizeof(*cstate), GFP_KERNEL);

    if (!cstate) {
        // Handle memory allocation failure gracefully, e.g., logging and exiting
        return;
    }

    if (crtc->state)
        dpu_crtc_destroy_state(crtc, crtc->state);

    __drm_atomic_helper_crtc_reset(crtc, &cstate->base);
}
```
This ensures that the function gracefully handles failure conditions instead of executing undefined behavior.
