UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Dereferencing an uninitialized pointer `*errp`. If the initial value of `*errp` is not explicitly set, attempting to dereference it or assign a value to it via `*errp = ...` leads to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: There is an assumption that the caller initializes `*errp` properly before passing it to the function. If the caller passes an uninitialized pointer for `*errp`, the dereference (`if (!*errp)`) and assignment are potentially unsafe, causing unpredictable behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before the dereference of `*errp`, ensure that the pointer is initialized to a safe value, such as `NULL`. Add a sanity-check block to validate inputs early in the function:

```c
if (!errp) {
    return -1; // Or some error code indicating invalid input.
}
```
Also, document clearly that the caller should initialize `*errp` to a valid pointer or `NULL` before passing it to this function.
