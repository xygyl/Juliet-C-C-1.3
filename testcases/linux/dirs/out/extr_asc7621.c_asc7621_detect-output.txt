UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `read_byte` is called without verifying its return value. If `read_byte` returns an -ENOMEM, -EIO, or similar error code as a signed integer, the comparison against unsigned values (`asc7621_chips[chip_index].company_id` or `.verstep_id`) could lead to undefined behavior (UB), especially in the Microsoft ABI for a processing checker.

Bug Detected: potentially Memory safety
