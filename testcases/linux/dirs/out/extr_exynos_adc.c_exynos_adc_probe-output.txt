Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_exynos_adc.c_exynos_adc_probe.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses `platform_get_irq(pdev, 1)` to get an IRQ value and assigns it to `info->tsirq`. However, it does not check if the returned value is negative before using it in subsequent operations when `has_ts` is true. If the IRQ value is negative (invalid), this could lead to undefined behavior when calling `free_irq(info->tsirq, info)` in the cleanup section.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that the secondary IRQ returned by `platform_get_irq(pdev, 1)` is valid, but it fails to validate it for values less than zero (other than `-EPROBE_DEFER`). If the IRQ is invalid, subsequent operations like `free_irq(info->tsirq, info)` could result in improper behavior or crashes. This is a logic oversight in error handling.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add error validation after retrieving `info->tsirq` using `platform_get_irq(pdev, 1)`. Specifically, ensure that the value of `info->tsirq` is checked for negativity (e.g., `if (irq < 0)` condition) before using it in later operations.  

Code update example:
```c
irq = platform_get_irq(pdev, 1);
if (irq < 0 && irq != -EPROBE_DEFER) {
    dev_err(&pdev->dev, "failed requesting secondary irq.\n");
    return irq;
}
info->tsirq = irq;
```
