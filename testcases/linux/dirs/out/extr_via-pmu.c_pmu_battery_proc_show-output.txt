Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_via-pmu.c_pmu_battery_proc_show.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code does not validate `batnum` before using it as an index into the `pmu_batteries` array. If `batnum` is out of bounds for the `pmu_batteries` array, this leads to undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: If `batnum` is out of range (either negative or exceeding the number of elements in `pmu_batteries`), it results in incorrect memory access or potential crash due to a segmentation fault or corruption of unrelated memory.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking to ensure `batnum` is within the valid range of indices for the `pmu_batteries` array:

```c
if (batnum < 0 || batnum >= ARRAY_SIZE(pmu_batteries)) {
    return -EINVAL; // or another appropriate error code
}
```

Replace `ARRAY_SIZE(pmu_batteries)` with the actual size or macro representing the number of elements in `pmu_batteries`.
