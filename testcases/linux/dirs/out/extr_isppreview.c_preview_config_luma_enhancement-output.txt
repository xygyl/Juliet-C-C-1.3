UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential NULL pointer dereferenceâ€”`yt->table` is dereferenced without validation to check if `yt` or its `table` member is non-NULL. If `params` or `params->luma` is NULL, it would lead to undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If the `params` structure or its `luma` member is NULL, dereferencing them in `yt = &params->luma;` or later in `yt->table[i]` would result in null pointer dereference and undefined behavior. Additional validation is required to prevent this scenario.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
Add proper null checks for `params`, `params->luma`, and `yt->table` at the beginning of the function. For example:
```c
if (!params || !yt || !yt->table) {
    return; // Or handle the error appropriately
}
```
