UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit any undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. All pointer accesses and operations appear valid, there is no evidence of out-of-bounds accesses, no uninitialized variable usage, and no pointer arithmetic violations.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The `default:` case in the `switch` statement fails to either handle unexpected `activedemod` values or return an error code. This could lead to a silent failure or incorrect behavior if `activedemod` is not `demod_ter` or `demod_cab`.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add proper handling or an error return in the `default:` case to ensure unexpected `activedemod` values are addressed. For example:

```c
    default:
        return -EINVAL; // Return an error code
```
