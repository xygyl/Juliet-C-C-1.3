UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing `chan->engn[engine->subdev.index]` without validating that `engine->subdev.index` is within bounds for `chan->engn` causes undefined behavior due to a possible out-of-bounds array access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: If `engine->subdev.index` is greater than the size of the `chan->engn` array minus one, the function may cause a crash or corrupt memory during the access to `chan->engn[engine->subdev.index]`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate that `engine->subdev.index` is within valid bounds before accessing `chan->engn` (e.g., check if `engine->subdev.index < SIZE_OF_ENGN_ARRAY`, where `SIZE_OF_ENGN_ARRAY` is the size of `chan->engn`).
