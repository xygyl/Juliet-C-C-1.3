### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `GLBtCoexist` global variable is used without initialization in the function `hal_btcoex_ScanNotify`. If `GLBtCoexist` is an uninitialized pointer or invalid memory location, this results in undefined behavior as per C standards.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: Given that `GLBtCoexist` may be uninitialized or set to an invalid memory address, dereferencing it in the call to `EXhalbtcoutsrc_ScanNotify` could lead to a null pointer dereference or access to invalid memory. If `GLBtCoexist` is not properly initialized elsewhere in the program, this is a logic flaw leading to potential crashes at runtime.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Ensure `GLBtCoexist` is initialized properly before invoking `hal_btcoex_ScanNotify`. Additionally, consider adding a null check for `GLBtCoexist` inside the function like this:
```c
if (!GLBtCoexist) {
    // Handle the error or initialize GLBtCoexist appropriately
    return;
}
```  
This avoids potential null pointer dereference and undefined behavior.
