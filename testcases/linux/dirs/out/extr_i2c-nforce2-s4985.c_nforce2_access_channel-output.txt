UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing `last_channels` before initialization can result in undefined behavior. If `last_channels` is uninitialized before the function is called, comparing it (`last_channels != channels`) may lead to UB because reading an uninitialized variable has undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The variable `last_channels` is used without explicit initialization or validation, which can cause incorrect behavior. Specifically, the comparison against `channels` could produce an unintended equality result, and accessing uninitialized memory violates the expected logic of the program.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Initialize `last_channels` explicitly to a known value before its first usage, possibly in a constructor or initialization function, to ensure well-defined behavior (`static u8 last_channels = 0;` if such a value is appropriate).
