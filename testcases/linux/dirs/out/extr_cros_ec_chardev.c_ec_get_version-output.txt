UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Possible out-of-bounds memory access due to `current_image_name[resp->current_image]` when `resp->current_image` exceeds the bounds of `current_image_name` array by being greater than or equal to `ARRAY_SIZE(current_image_name)` before its value is adjusted. The `if` block checks bounds but does not completely guard against this issue due to inconsistent logic execution order.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access
Bug Reason: The function assumes `resp->current_image` is adjusted correctly before accessing `current_image_name` with `current_image_name[resp->current_image]`. However, if `resp->current_image` was already invalid on reception, it creates a risk of out-of-bounds array access before adjustment. This is a critical flaw in logic and memory access.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure the adjustment of `resp->current_image` to the value `3` explicitly occurs before array access. For example:
```c
if (resp->current_image >= ARRAY_SIZE(current_image_name))
    resp->current_image = 3;  /* invalid */
snprintf(str, maxlen, "%s\n%s\n%s\n%s\n", CROS_EC_DEV_VERSION,
         resp->version_string_ro, resp->version_string_rw,
         current_image_name[resp->current_image]);
```
This guarantees safe access to `current_image_name` and prevents undefined behavior.
