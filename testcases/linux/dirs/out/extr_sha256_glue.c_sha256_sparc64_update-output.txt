Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sha256_glue.c_sha256_sparc64_update.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `memcpy` invocation could potentially exhibit undefined behavior because it copies `len` bytes from `data` to `sctx->buf + partial`, but there is no check ensuring the memory area `sctx->buf + partial` is large enough to accommodate `len` bytes. This could lead to out-of-bounds memory access if `len` exceeds the capacity of the buffer.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The function does not check whether `partial + len` exceeds the allocated size of `sctx->buf`, potentially causing a buffer overflow and memory corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before invoking `memcpy`, ensure that `partial + len` does not exceed the size of `sctx->buf` (presumably `SHA256_BLOCK_SIZE`). For example:
```c
if (partial + len > SHA256_BLOCK_SIZE) {
    return -1; // Or handle the error appropriately
}
memcpy(sctx->buf + partial, data, len);
```
