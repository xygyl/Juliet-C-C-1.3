### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences the `info` pointer (`info->block_w`) but does not verify whether `info` is `NULL`. If the function is called with `info == NULL`, this results in undefined behavior due to a null pointer dereference. Additionally, the `block_w` array access does not validate if `plane` is within bounds, which can lead to out-of-bounds array access (also UB).  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference, Potential Out-of-Bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: 
1. The lack of validation for whether `info` is `NULL` could lead to a null pointer dereference.  
2. The index `plane` used for accessing `block_w[plane]` is not checked to ensure it falls within valid array bounds for `block_w`. This could lead to out-of-bounds memory access bugs.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence:
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Validate the `info` pointer before dereferencing it:
   ```c
   if (!info)
       return 1;
   ```
2. Check if the `plane` index is within valid bounds (e.g., based on the length of `block_w` array). This requires knowledge of the array's maximum size:
   ```c
   if (plane < 0 || plane >= BLOCK_W_MAX) // Replace BLOCK_W_MAX with the correct maximum length
       return 1;
   ```  
Adding these checks would prevent both undefined behavior and logic bugs.
