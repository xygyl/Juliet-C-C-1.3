Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vector.c_dal_vector_construct.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `capacity` or `struct_size` are zero (checked explicitly), attempting to call `kcalloc(capacity, struct_size, GFP_KERNEL)` may lead to undefined behavior as some implementations may treat zero-sized allocations as errors or behave inconsistently.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The check for zero-sized `capacity` or `struct_size` prevents invalid inputs but is followed by an unconditional call to `kcalloc`. If these values are zero, proceeding with the allocation contradicts the error-check logic, causing inconsistent behavior. Furthermore, the function sets `vector->container = NULL`, but does not clean up properly when `capacity` or `struct_size` are found invalid, leaving the struct in a partial, invalid state.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Move the `vector->container = NULL;` line after the validation checks for `struct_size` and `capacity`. If either is zero, return `false` immediately without calling `kcalloc`. Alternatively, add a validation blocking allocation on zero-sized values explicitly before dynamically allocating.
