### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function appears to be well-formed with respect to the C standard. `strcmp` is used correctly, and the string comparison logic doesn't invoke undefined behavior such as dereferencing null pointers or performing out-of-bounds memory access within the scope of this function. There is no signed integer overflow, uninitialized variable usage, or pointer misuse.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The `name` argument is dereferenced in the `strcmp` function, which assumes that `name` is a valid (non-NULL) pointer. However, the function does not verify that `name` is non-NULL. If the caller passes `NULL` for `name`, `strcmp(name, ...)` will invoke undefined behavior, leading to a potential crash. This is a logical error.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
Add a NULL check at the beginning of the function to ensure `name` is valid before performing any operations:  
```c
static int wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(const char *name) {
    if (name == NULL) {
        return -EINVAL;
    }
    if (strcmp(name, "AIF1.1 EQ Mode") == 0)
        return 0;
    if (strcmp(name, "AIF1.2 EQ Mode") == 0)
        return 1;
    if (strcmp(name, "AIF2 EQ Mode") == 0)
        return 2;
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
This fixes the bug by preventing the potential null pointer dereference.
