UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The code does not contain any evident signs of undefined behavior. It correctly checks return values from function calls, memory allocations, and semaphore/dma pool initialization. There is no dereferencing of invalid pointers or uninitialized memory accesses. Signed integer overflow is not a concern as no arithmetic operations on signed integers are performed in a problematic manner.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Resource Management Bug  
Bug Reason: If `sec_base_init()` or `sec_queue_config()` fails, the resources allocated prior to these calls (e.g., `info->hw_sgl_pool`) are not released before returning an error code. This results in a resource leak. Specifically, the DMA pool (`info->hw_sgl_pool`) created by `dmam_pool_create` is not freed. Similarly, there is no cleanup for mutex `info->dev_lock`. This can lead to resource exhaustion and memory leakage over time, particularly if the driver is probed multiple times due to errors or restarts.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add proper cleanup for resources allocated (e.g., `info->hw_sgl_pool`) when an error occurs before returning. This can be achieved by introducing cleanup code in the error handling paths for `sec_base_init()` and `sec_queue_config()`. Additionally, ensure mutex `info->dev_lock` is cleaned up appropriately if `sec_base_init()` fails.

Example fix:
```c
info = devm_kzalloc(dev, (sizeof(*info)), GFP_KERNEL);
if (!info)
    return -ENOMEM;

info->dev = dev;
mutex_init(&info->dev_lock);

info->hw_sgl_pool = dmam_pool_create("sgl", dev,
                                     sizeof(struct sec_hw_sgl), 64, 0);
if (!info->hw_sgl_pool) {
    dev_err(dev, "Failed to create sec sgl dma pool\n");
    mutex_destroy(&info->dev_lock); // Added cleanup for mutex
    return -ENOMEM;
}

ret = sec_base_init(info, pdev);
if (ret) {
    dev_err(dev, "Base initialization fail! %d\n", ret);
    dmam_pool_destroy(info->hw_sgl_pool); // Added cleanup for DMA pool
    mutex_destroy(&info->dev_lock); 
    return ret;
}
```

This ensures allocated resources are properly released on failure scenarios, preventing memory/resource leaks.
