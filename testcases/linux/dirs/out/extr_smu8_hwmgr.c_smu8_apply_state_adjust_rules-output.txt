UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: `data->sys_info.nbp_memory_clock[1]` and `data->sys_info.nbp_memory_clock[SMU8_NUM_NBPMEMORYCLOCK - 1]` might access out-of-bounds if the `nbp_memory_clock` array has fewer elements than referenced indices (e.g., less than 2 or less than `SMU8_NUM_NBPMEMORYCLOCK`). This results in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds memory access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: As the array size of `nbp_memory_clock` isn't validated against the indices `1` and `SMU8_NUM_NBPMEMORYCLOCK - 1`, accessing these elements risks an out-of-bounds error, potentially causing memory corruption or crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate the size of the `nbp_memory_clock` array before accessing its elements. For example:
```c
if (SMU8_NUM_NBPMEMORYCLOCK > 1)
    clocks.memoryClock = hwmgr->display_config->min_mem_set_clock != 0 ?
                         hwmgr->display_config->min_mem_set_clock :
                         data->sys_info.nbp_memory_clock[1];

if (SMU8_NUM_NBPMEMORYCLOCK > 0)
    force_high = (clocks.memoryClock > data->sys_info.nbp_memory_clock[SMU8_NUM_NBPMEMORYCLOCK - 1])
                 || (hwmgr->display_config->num_display >= 3);
```
Alternatively, ensure `nbp_memory_clock` is initialized with sufficient elements.
