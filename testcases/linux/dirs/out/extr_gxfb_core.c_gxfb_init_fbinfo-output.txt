Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_gxfb_core.c_gxfb_init_fbinfo.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The expression `(void *)par + sizeof(struct gxfb_par)` used to initialize `info->pseudo_palette` is undefined behavior due to pointer arithmetic on a `void*` type. The C standard does not define the behavior of arithmetic operations on `void*`. Pointer arithmetic is only valid on pointers to object types, and `sizeof(void)` is not defined.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The undefined behavior described above may lead to incorrect pointer manipulation, which can result in unexpected memory accesses or potentially breaking the pseudopalette initialization. While not guaranteed, this can cause instability or crashes depending on how `info->pseudo_palette` is later accessed.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `(void *)par + sizeof(struct gxfb_par)` with `((char *)par + sizeof(struct gxfb_par))` or cast `par` to a proper type like `uint8_t*` before performing the pointer arithmetic. This ensures the arithmetic is valid as per the C standard.
