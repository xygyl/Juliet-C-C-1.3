UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior due to possible signed integer overflow in variables like `pmirq` or calculations like `master = block / PM8821_BLOCKS_PER_MASTER` when `block` or `PM8821_BLOCKS_PER_MASTER` are misused. Additionally, `irq_data_get_irq_chip_data`, could cause undefined behavior if `struct pm_irq_chip` resolves in invalid memory errors.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: logical inter-scalar race bit to cross std-limits unsafety pointers states (`unsigned ints`)
Bug Reason: `<description>`
