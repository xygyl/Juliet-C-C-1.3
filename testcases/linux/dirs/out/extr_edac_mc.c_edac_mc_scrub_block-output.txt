UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Pointer arithmetic is performed on `virt_addr` (void pointer). The C standard prohibits arithmetic on void pointers because the size of the object pointed to is not defined. This could lead to an incorrect address computation, resulting in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The function assumes `offset` is valid relative to `virt_addr`, but there is no check to ensure `offset + size` does not exceed the memory block mapped at `virt_addr`. This can lead to out-of-bounds memory access, potentially causing a crash or memory corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Replace `virt_addr + offset` with `(char *)virt_addr + offset` to perform pointer arithmetic correctly.
2. Add bounds checking on `offset` and `size` to ensure they fall within the valid range for the mapped memory.
