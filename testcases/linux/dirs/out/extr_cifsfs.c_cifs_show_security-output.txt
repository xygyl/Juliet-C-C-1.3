UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing a potentially null pointer (`ses`) without a validity check violates the C standard behavior. The function accesses `ses->sectype`, `ses->user_name`, `ses->cred_uid`, and `ses->sign` directly without ensuring that `ses` is non-NULL. If this function is called with a null `ses` parameter, it will lead to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The code does not account for the possibility that `ses` might be NULL. As a result, dereferencing a null pointer could cause a segmentation fault at runtime. Additionally, the default case in the switch statement should never occur, as stated in the comment, but if `ses->sectype` contains an invalid value, the program could produce unexpected results.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add a null-check for `ses` at the beginning of the function:  
   ```c
   if (!ses) {
       seq_puts(s, "invalid ses parameter");
       return;
   }
   ```  
2. Validate `ses->sectype` to ensure it falls within the expected range of valid values before the switch statement executes.
