### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The code does not contain operations leading to undefined behavior according to the C standard. All variables appear to be well-initialized, and the function handles potential errors (`retval` check) appropriately. There is no signed integer overflow, null pointer dereferencing, strict aliasing violation, or out-of-bounds memory access evident in this snippet.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: If `bus_create_file(bus, &bus_attr_drivers_probe)` succeeds, but the second call to `bus_create_file(bus, &bus_attr_drivers_autoprobe)` fails, the function removes only `bus_attr_drivers_probe` without handling cleanup for failure context (`retval = bus_create_file(bus, &bus_attr_drivers_autoprobe)`). This may lead to an inconsistency because `bus_attr_drivers_autoprobe` is not created but `bus_attr_drivers_probe` is removed, leaving the system in an unintended state. 
Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Ensure both files are properly cleaned up if either fails. Adjust the cleanup logic as follows:
```c
static int add_probe_files(struct bus_type *bus)
{
    int retval;

    retval = bus_create_file(bus, &bus_attr_drivers_probe);
    if (retval)
        return retval;

    retval = bus_create_file(bus, &bus_attr_drivers_autoprobe);
    if (retval) {
        bus_remove_file(bus, &bus_attr_drivers_probe); // Cleanup the first file
        return retval; // Return error
    }

    return 0; // Success
}
```
This ensures that the function cleans up completely in the event of an error.
