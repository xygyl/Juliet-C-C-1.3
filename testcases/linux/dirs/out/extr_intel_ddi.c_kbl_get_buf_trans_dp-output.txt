UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Dereferencing a null pointer is possible when the `dev_priv` pointer passed to the function is not initialized or set to NULL. Specifically, the function calls macros `IS_KBL_ULX(dev_priv)` and similar, which implicitly dereference `dev_priv`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If the `dev_priv` pointer is NULL when executing this function, dereferencing it in the `IS_KBL_ULX`, `IS_CFL_ULX`, `IS_KBL_ULT`, or `IS_CFL_ULT` macro calls would result in undefined behavior and likely cause a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to validate that `dev_priv` is not NULL. For example:
```c
if (dev_priv == NULL) {
    *n_entries = 0;
    return NULL;
}
```
