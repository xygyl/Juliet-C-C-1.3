UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The pointer `edid` is dereferenced multiple times (e.g., `edid->width_cm`, `edid->height_cm`) without verifying that the memory dynamically allocated or returned by `drm_get_edid()` is valid and properly initialized. If `edid` is a non-NULL pointer to uninitialized or invalid memory, accessing its members invokes undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `drm_get_edid()` returns NULL, the pointer `edid` may be dereferenced before reaching the check `if (!edid)` in the `fail` block. For instance, the use of `edid->width_cm` and `edid->height_cm` in `DRM_DEBUG_KMS` assumes `edid` is valid, resulting in a null pointer dereference.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Check if `edid` is NULL immediately after the `drm_get_edid()` call and before accessing or dereferencing any of its members. For example:
```c
edid = drm_get_edid(connector, hdmi->ddc_adapt);
if (!edid) {
    DRM_ERROR("Can't read HDMI EDID\n");
    return 0;
}
```
This ensures that `edid` is validated before any member access.
