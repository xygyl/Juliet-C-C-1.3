UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function does not contain undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. All variables are initialized appropriately, pointers are valid and not dereferenced incorrectly, and there are no violations of strict aliasing rules or out-of-bounds accesses.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The assignments to `*delay_on` and `*delay_off` override the original values passed by the caller. This means that even if the caller supplied valid values matching the conditions (`500` for both), their values will always be overwritten, leading to potential confusion or incorrect functionality. This seems unnecessary and logic-breaking since the caller's values are ignored entirely after validation.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Consider removing the assignments to `*delay_on` and `*delay_off` unless there is a specific reason for overriding the caller's values. If overriding is necessary, ensure proper documentation for the behavior change to inform the caller.
