UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function performs `window->ref_count -= nr_pages`, but there is no validation to ensure that the pointer `window` is not `NULL`. Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer is undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If the `window` pointer is passed as `NULL`, the function will attempt to dereference it (`window->ref_count`) and access an invalid memory location, causing a potential crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before performing any operations on `window`, add a check to confirm it is not `NULL`. Example:
```c
if (!window)
    return;
window->ref_count -= nr_pages;
```
