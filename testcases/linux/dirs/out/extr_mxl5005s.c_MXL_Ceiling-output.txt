Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mxl5005s.c_MXL_Ceiling.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Division by zero may occur if `resolution` is passed as zero. Division by zero results in undefined behavior as per the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate that the `resolution` parameter is non-zero, and a division by zero could result in runtime failure. Potentially this could crash the program.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `resolution` is not zero:  
```c
static u32 MXL_Ceiling(u32 value, u32 resolution)
{
    if (resolution == 0)
    {
        // Handle the error case (e.g., return a special value or signal an error)
        return 0;  // Returning 0 as a default behavior, modify based on requirements.
    }
    return value / resolution + (value % resolution > 0 ? 1 : 0);
}
```
