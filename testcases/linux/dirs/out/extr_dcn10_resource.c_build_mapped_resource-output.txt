Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dcn10_resource.c_build_mapped_resource.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `resource_get_head_pipe_for_stream()` returns `NULL` (default for failed initialization or missing resource), the function attempts to dereference `pipe_ctx` in `build_pipe_hw_param()`, causing undefined behavior through a null pointer dereference.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `pipe_ctx` is never `NULL` after calling `resource_get_head_pipe_for_stream()`, but it explicitly checks for `!pipe_ctx`. The control flow suggests that the early exit (`DC_ERROR_UNEXPECTED`) is meant to guard against potential null pointer dereference. However, if `build_pipe_hw_param(pipe_ctx)` is reached without fixing that underlying assumption via logic, the program may dereference a `NULL` pointer.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add proper checks to proactively ensure `pipe_ctx` is not NULL before invoking `build_pipe_hw_param`. For instance, return an error or log diagnostics in case of NULL pointers—preferably decouple runtime exceptions through diagnosable saftey-rules/XML-DB 앱 restructuring RULE Debug.
