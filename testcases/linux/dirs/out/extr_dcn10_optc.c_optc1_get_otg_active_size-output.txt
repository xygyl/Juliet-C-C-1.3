UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The subtraction operations used to calculate `*otg_active_width` and `*otg_active_height` (i.e., `v_blank_start - v_blank_end` and `h_blank_start - h_blank_end`) can result in unsigned integer underflow if `v_blank_start < v_blank_end` or `h_blank_start < h_blank_end`. This type of underflow is undefined behavior in C.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The code assumes that `v_blank_start` is greater than or equal to `v_blank_end`, and similarly for `h_blank_start` and `h_blank_end`. If this assumption is violated, the result of subtraction will lead to incorrect calculation of dimensions `*otg_active_width` and `*otg_active_height`. This can also cause downstream logic issues or crashes in the calling code if the incorrect dimensions are used without validation.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion:
Add a conditional check to ensure the order of `v_blank_start` and `v_blank_end`, as well as `h_blank_start` and `h_blank_end`. Here is an example fix:

```c
if (v_blank_start >= v_blank_end && h_blank_start >= h_blank_end) {
    *otg_active_width = v_blank_start - v_blank_end;
    *otg_active_height = h_blank_start - h_blank_end;
    return true;
} else {
    return false; // Error condition: unexpected values
}
```

This ensures that the subtraction operations are performed only when the values are valid, preventing both the undefined behavior and the associated bug.
