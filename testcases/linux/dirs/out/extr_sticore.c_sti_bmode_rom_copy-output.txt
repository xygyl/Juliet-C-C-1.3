UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function performs pointer arithmetic and dereferencing without verifying that `dest` is non-NULL. If `dest` is NULL when the function is called, dereferencing and incrementing `dest` causes undefined behavior as per the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `dest` is NULL, the pointer arithmetic and dereferencing will result in a null pointer dereference causing a crash. This bug stems directly from the undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to validate that `dest` is not NULL:
```c
if (dest == NULL) {
    // Handle error, e.g., log and return early.
    return;
}
```
