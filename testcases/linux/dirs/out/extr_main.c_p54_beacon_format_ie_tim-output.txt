UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function may dereference invalid pointer values due to lack of checks on the return of `p54_find_ie`. Also, `skb_tail_pointer(skb)` could return a pointer that is misaligned or invalid if the `skb->len` is corrupted or improperly set, leading to undefined behavior during pointer arithmetic or dereferencing.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory corruption / Invalid pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: The `p54_find_ie` function is used to locate an information element but does not guarantee that the data returned is valid at the end of its `tim` usage. Furthermore, moving memory with `memmove(tim, next, ...)` without strict pointer alignment checks or validating the memory range might cause undefined operations, particularly if `next` or `tim` overlaps oddly. This could lead to buffer corruption further crashing observed==`tim[].
