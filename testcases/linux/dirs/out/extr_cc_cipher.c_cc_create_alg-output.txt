Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cc_cipher.c_cc_create_alg.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses `snprintf` to copy data into `alg->base.cra_name` and `alg->base.cra_driver_name`. However, these members are not guaranteed to have sufficient space allocated for holding the formatted string. If either `tmpl->name` or `tmpl->driver_name` exceeds the `CRYPTO_MAX_ALG_NAME` size, a buffer overflow might occur. This can lead to undefined behavior as the size constraints of the destination buffers are unknown.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: As described above, `snprintf` may write past the bounds of `alg->base.cra_name` or `alg->base.cra_driver_name` if `tmpl->name` or `tmpl->driver_name` is larger than the specified buffer size `CRYPTO_MAX_ALG_NAME`. This results in a memory corruption bug which could crash the program or produce unexpected results.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `tmpl->name` and `tmpl->driver_name` are validated to be within `CRYPTO_MAX_ALG_NAME` size before passing them to `snprintf`. Alternatively, use a safer approach and truncate the strings if they exceed the buffer size.

For example, you could use the `strncpy` function to safely copy a fixed number of characters:
```c
strncpy(alg->base.cra_name, tmpl->name, CRYPTO_MAX_ALG_NAME - 1);
alg->base.cra_name[CRYPTO_MAX_ALG_NAME - 1] = '\0'; // Guarantee null-termination
```

Similarly, handle `alg->base.cra_driver_name` in the same manner.
