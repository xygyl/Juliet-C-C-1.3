Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nfsfh.h_fh_copy_shallow.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function invokes `memcpy()` with a size parameter `src->fh_size`. If `src->fh_size` exceeds the valid memory boundaries of `src->fh_base`, this causes undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds memory access. There's no validation to ensure that `src->fh_size` represents a safe and valid size for the memory region being copied.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential buffer overflow
Bug Reason: The function does not perform any checks to ensure that `src->fh_size` does not exceed the size of the buffer in `dst->fh_base`. If `src->fh_size` is larger than the size of the destination buffer, memory corruption at `dst` can occur. Additionally, if `src->fh_size` is inconsistent with the source buffer size, it may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect logic.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
- Add boundary checks for `src->fh_size` to ensure it does not exceed the allocated memory size of both the source (`src->fh_base`) and destination (`dst->fh_base`) buffers.
- Example fix:
  ```c
  if (src->fh_size <= MAX_ALLOWED_SIZE && src->fh_size <= sizeof(dst->fh_base)) {
      dst->fh_size = src->fh_size;
      memcpy(&dst->fh_base, &src->fh_base, src->fh_size);
  } else {
      // Handle error, e.g., log and return
  }
  ```
- Ensure `MAX_ALLOWED_SIZE` is defined appropriately based on the buffer's allocated size.
