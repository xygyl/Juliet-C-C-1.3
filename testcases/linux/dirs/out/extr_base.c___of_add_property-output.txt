UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `prop->name` or `(*next)->name` is NULL (not explicitly checked in the code), the call to `strcmp` causes undefined behavior as it requires valid pointers.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The function does not check if `prop` or its `name` field is NULL, nor does it check if `(*next)` or its `name` field is NULL, which could lead to an incorrect operation or crash during `strcmp`. Additionally, the `prop` structure is linked to the end of the list unconditionally, which might cause issues in cases of ongoing concurrency.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Add checks for NULL pointers before invoking `strcmp`:
   ```c
   if (!prop || !prop->name) {
       return -EEXIST; // Return error code for bad input
   }
   while (*next) {
       if (!(*next)->name) {
           return -EEXIST; // Return error code for bad input in list
       }
       if (strcmp(prop->name, (*next)->name) == 0)
           return -EEXIST; // Duplicate
       next = &(*next)->next;
   }
   ```
2. If this function is intended to be thread-safe, consider locking mechanisms to prevent concurrency issues when modifying the linked list.
