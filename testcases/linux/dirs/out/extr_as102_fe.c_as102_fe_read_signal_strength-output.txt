UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible signed integer overflow in the expression `(((0xffff * 400) * state->signal_strength + 41000) * 2)` since `state->signal_strength` is a signed integer. The multiplication of `0xffff * 400 * state->signal_strength` can result in a value exceeding the range of a signed integer, which leads to undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw / Potential integer overflow  
Bug Reason: Even if signed integer overflow does not occur, the computed signal strength value could be incorrect or unintentionally large. Since `state->signal_strength` is multiplied by two large constants (`0xffff` and `400`), the result may exceed the realistic limits of signal strength. This could lead to incorrect downstream logic and erroneous handling of signal strength values.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Explicitly cast the computations to an appropriate unsigned data type to avoid signed integer overflow, and validate that the resulting signal strength falls within a sane range. For example:  
```c
*strength = (u16)(((((unsigned long)0xffff * 400) * (unsigned long)state->signal_strength) + 41000) * 2);
```  
Additionally, add bounds checking for `state->signal_strength` prior to calculation.
