**UB Analysis**

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses macro `put_unaligned_be16` and `put_unaligned_be32` to write values into a fixed-size `u8 buf[6]`. An overflow can occur when `len + 2 > 6`, resulting in buffer overrun and memory corruption. Although there is a check earlier for `len > 4`, the passed `len` must also be checked against the capability of `buf` storage for cumulative room.
