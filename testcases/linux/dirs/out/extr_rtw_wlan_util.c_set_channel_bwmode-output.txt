Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_rtw_wlan_util.c_set_channel_bwmode.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The expression `center_ch = channel + 2` and `center_ch = channel - 2` could lead to undefined behavior due to implicit wrapping in unsigned arithmetic if `channel` is close to its upper or lower boundaries (e.g., unsigned subtraction leading to wraparound).
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-range channel computation
Bug Reason: The computation of `center_ch` using `channel + 2` or `channel - 2` may result in a channel value that is out of range or invalid for hardware. No explicit checks ensure the resulting channel is within valid bounds.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to ensure that `channel + 2` and `channel - 2` do not exceed valid channel ranges. For instance:
```c
if (channel_offset == HAL_PRIME_CHNL_OFFSET_LOWER) {
    center_ch = (channel <= 254) ? channel + 2 : channel; // Ensure channel doesn't exceed upper limit
} else {
    center_ch = (channel >= 2) ? channel - 2 : channel;   // Ensure channel doesn't go negative
}
```
