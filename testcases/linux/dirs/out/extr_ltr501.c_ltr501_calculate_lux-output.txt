### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:
- **Integer Overflow:** The multiplication `ir_data * 100` and addition operation `ir_data + vis_data` in `DIV_ROUND_UP(ir_data * 100, ir_data + vis_data)` may cause integer overflow if `ir_data` and/or `vis_data` values are extremely large, as `u16` is only 16 bits wide.
- **Division by Zero:** The denominator `ir_data + vis_data` in `DIV_ROUND_UP(ir_data * 100, ir_data + vis_data)` could theoretically be zero if both `ir_data` and `vis_data` are zero. While the function checks for `vis_data == 0`, it does not verify the condition where both `ir_data` and `vis_data` are zero. This introduces the possibility of undefined behavior.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug and Possible Overflow  
Bug Reason:
1. **Logic Flaw:** If both `ir_data` and `vis_data` are zero, the denominator in the ratio calculation (`ir_data + vis_data`) becomes zero, leading to undefined behavior. Although `vis_data == 0` is checked upfront, it is insufficient to prevent this case.
2. **Integer Overflow:** Operations like `ir_data * 100` and `DIV_ROUND_UP` can result in values exceeding the capacity of `u16`, which could cause incorrect calculations or undefined behavior.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
1. **Prevent Division by Zero:** Add a check for `(ir_data == 0 && vis_data == 0)` at the beginning of the function. If this condition holds true, immediately return `0`.
   ```c
   if (vis_data == 0 || (ir_data == 0 && vis_data == 0))
       return 0;
   ```
2. **Use Larger Data Types:** Replace `u16` with a larger unsigned integer type (`unsigned int` or `unsigned long`) for operations such as `ir_data * 100` and `ir_data + vis_data` to prevent integer overflow. Ensure that the `DIV_ROUND_UP` macro handles larger types properly.

3. **Consider Saturation Checks:** If input data for `vis_data` or `ir_data` is not guaranteed to be within a safe range, consider adding checks to cap their values at a defined, safe maximum (e.g., UINT16_MAX).

By addressing these issues, the function can be made robust against undefined behavior and logic flaws.
