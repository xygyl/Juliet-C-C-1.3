UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Casting pointer values (e.g., `MAIN_BLKADDR(sbi)`) directly to `loff_t` and shifting it left by `PAGE_SHIFT` may lead to undefined behavior if the pointer value is not suitably aligned or if the shift operation exceeds the representation bounds of `loff_t`. Moreover, the computation `(loff_t)MAIN_BLKADDR(sbi) << PAGE_SHIFT` is particularly susceptible to overflow if `MAIN_BLKADDR(sbi)` is large or if `PAGE_SHIFT` is exceptionally high, depending on the system architecture. This causes undefined behavior per the C standard regarding improper pointer arithmetic and integer overflow.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw/Undefined Pointer Arithmetic  
Bug Reason: The use of `(loff_t)MAIN_BLKADDR(sbi) << PAGE_SHIFT` suggests that `MAIN_BLKADDR(sbi)` is likely a pointer or scalar value, yet no clear guarantee exists regarding its alignment, correctness, or whether it is valid for arithmetic operations. This could lead to incorrect truncation or misinterpretation of memory addresses and cause unintended memory access issues. Additionally, operations involving meta page truncation (`truncate_inode_pages_range`) may fail silently without clear remediation if `MAIN_BLKADDR(sbi)` is invalid.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `MAIN_BLKADDR(sbi)` is validated as a proper memory address or scalar before performing arithmetic or shifting. Use safer conversion and address arithmetic methods, or explicitly check for overflows. For example, clamp or validate the result of the computation before passing it to `truncate_inode_pages_range`.
