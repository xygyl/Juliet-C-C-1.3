UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: There is no evidence of undefined behavior in this function. Pointer checks (`priv->src_sd` and `priv->sink`) correctly prevent null dereferencing. Signed integer handling (`stream_count +/- 1`) is safe as the value is confined to range checks, and mutex operations ensure thread safety.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The logic in `priv->stream_count += enable ? 1 : -1;` could cause inconsistencies. Specifically, when `enable` is false, the logic decreases the `stream_count`, but there's no logic preventing `stream_count` from becoming negative (apart from the manual adjustment at the end). Although the function compensates for it by resetting negative values to zero (`if (priv->stream_count < 0) priv->stream_count = 0;`), this creates unnecessary complexity and risks incorrect streaming states if errors occur elsewhere.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Modify the logic to ensure that `stream_count` cannot become negative directly:  
```c
if (!enable && priv->stream_count > 0) {
    priv->stream_count--;
} else if (enable) {
    priv->stream_count++;
}
```
This ensures `stream_count` is always valid without relying on post-correction, simplifying the flow and eliminating potential issues related to invalid intermediate values.
