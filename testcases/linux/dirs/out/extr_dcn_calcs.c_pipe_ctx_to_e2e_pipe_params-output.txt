Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dcn_calcs.c_pipe_ctx_to_e2e_pipe_params.c
UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function does not include any operations that are explicitly undefined by the C language standard, such as dereferencing null or invalid pointers, signed integer overflow, or accessing uninitialized variables. Strict aliasing rules are adhered to, and no misaligned memory access occurs.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The line `input->dest.vupdate_offset = pipe->pipe_dlg_param.vupdate_offset;` is repeated, overwriting itself unnecessarily. This redundancy does not cause undefined behavior or memory corruption but can confuse maintainers and lead to subtle issues in the future, especially if the repeated line is later modified independently without realizing its duplicate presence.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Remove the duplicate assignment `input->dest.vupdate_offset = pipe->pipe_dlg_param.vupdate_offset;`.
