Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_debug.c_ubifs_dump_lstats.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function `ubifs_dump_lstats` performs `pr_err` format string operations on values without ensuring their proper type. Specifically, it assumes that `lst->total_free`, `lst->total_dirty`, `lst->total_used`, `lst->total_dark`, and `lst->total_dead` are of type `long long` without proper type verification. If the type of these fields is not `long long`, this leads to undefined behavior due to incorrect format specifiers in `printf`-style functions.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: This code makes implicit assumptions about the types of the members in `struct ubifs_lp_stats`, without validating or imposing strict type guarantees. If `total_free`, `total_dirty`, etc., are of a type other than `long long` (e.g., `int` or `unsigned long long`), this mismatch could lead to runtime issues such as incorrect logging output or crashes during execution.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that all `struct ubifs_lp_stats` fields used in `pr_err` calls are explicitly defined with the appropriate type that matches the format specifiers, or use casting to ensure type safety. For example, if any field is not a `long long`, cast it explicitly to avoid UB:
```
pr_err("\ttaken_empty_lebs %d, total_free %lld, total_dirty %lld\n",
       lst->taken_empty_lebs, (long long)lst->total_free, (long long)lst->total_dirty);
```
Alternatively, update the `struct ubifs_lp_stats` definition to explicitly use the correct types for its members.
