UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow can occur if `x` equals `ULONG_MAX` and `++x` wraps around beyond the maximum representable value for `unsigned long`. The resulting value becomes 0 due to unsigned integer wraparound (this is defined by the standard for unsigned integers but introducing it into the logic here can inadvertently cause UB due to logical infinite looping previously not anticipated). Concurrently failure is indirect possibility of dp.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logical flaw
Bug Reason: Loop can become infinite flaw rendering CPU drainage malfunction
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
