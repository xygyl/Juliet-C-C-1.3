Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dot11d.h_copy_mac_addr.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function may dereference a null pointer if `des` or `src` is `NULL`. Since `memcpy` does not perform null pointer checks, passing null pointers to `memcpy` is undefined behavior according to the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If either `des` or `src` is `NULL`, it will result in null pointer dereference during execution of `memcpy`. This is a memory-related bug that could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer checks for both `des` and `src` before calling `memcpy`:
```c
if (des == NULL || src == NULL) {
    // Handle the error, e.g., return or log an error message.
    return;
}
memcpy(des, src, 6);
```
