### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Global Variable NTX_SCHED Undefined:** `NTX_SCHED` is used without its definition in this code snippet. If `NTX_SCHED` is not defined elsewhere (or is misconfigured, e.g., having a value of zero or being undefined), this results in undefined behavior when you attempt to iterate in the loop: `for (i = 0; i < NTX_SCHED; i++)`.
2. **Unspecified Value of `pace_vals` Pointer:** The function uses the `pace_vals` array without checking its validity. If the caller passes a null or invalid pointer, dereferencing `pace_vals[i]` would cause undefined behavior.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw, Potential Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason:  
1. **Potential Buffer Overflow:** The `pace_vals` array is indexed from 0 to `NTX_SCHED - 1`. If the caller allocates a smaller buffer due to incorrect size assumptions (or `NTX_SCHED` is misconfigured), this loop could lead to writing beyond the bounds of the `pace_vals` array, causing memory corruption.
2. **Unchecked Pointer Dereference:** The `pace_vals` array is passed as a pointer argument but is not checked for nullity, potentially leading to runtime crashes due to null pointer dereference.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Reason: Both bugs stem from the undefined behavior described above, specifically the unvalidated `NTX_SCHED` value and potentially invalid `pace_vals` pointer.

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add a check for the validity of the `pace_vals` pointer at the beginning of the function:
   ```c
   if (!pace_vals) {
       return; // or handle the error
   }
   ```
2. Validate `NTX_SCHED` to ensure it is a positive and defined value before using it:
   ```c
   #ifndef NTX_SCHED
   #error "NTX_SCHED must be defined"
   #endif
   ```
3. If `NTX_SCHED` is dynamically determined, add runtime validation for its range and handle edge cases (e.g., zero size).
