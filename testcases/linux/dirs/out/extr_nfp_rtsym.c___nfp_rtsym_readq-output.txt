Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nfp_rtsym.c___nfp_rtsym_readq.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The potential undefined behavior arises due to signed integer overflow when calculating `off + 8` in the condition `if (off + 8 > nfp_rtsym_size(sym))`. Since the `off` variable is of type `u64`, it is a signed long integer. If `off` is close to the maximum value of `u64`, adding 8 can result in overflow, which is undefined according to the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic bug
Bug Reason: Integer overflow or out-of-bounds condition might lead to unreliable bounds checking in the early validation step. This could potentially allow an invalid memory operation.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use safe arithmetic or explicitly check if adding 8 to `off` would overflow before performing the addition. For example:
```c
if (off > nfp_rtsym_size(sym) - 8) {
    nfp_err(cpp, "rtsym '%s': readq out of bounds: off: %lld + 8 > size: %lld\n",
            sym->name, off, nfp_rtsym_size(sym));
    return -ENXIO;
}
```
