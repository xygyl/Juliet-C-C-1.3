### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The provided function does not exhibit any undefined behavior as per the C standard. It performs a logical AND operation on an `u32` value and negates a preprocessor-defined macro (`GAHBCFG_GLBL_INTR_EN`) to modify the `ahbcfg` variable. The use of `dwc2_readl()` and `dwc2_writel()` suggests hardware-level register access, but no UB arises unless these functions themselves have issues or preconditions that are not met in their respective definitions. Dereferencing of `struct dwc2_hsotg *hsotg` does not cause UB since the pointer is passed as an argument, assuming it is valid and initialized prior to the call.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The `struct dwc2_hsotg *hsotg` pointer is passed as an argument but is not explicitly checked for validity in the function. If `hsotg` is null, it would result in undefined behavior when dereferenced in `dwc2_readl()` and `dwc2_writel()` calls, potentially causing a null pointer dereference. This oversight introduces a potential flaw into this code that could lead to a crash or unpredictable behavior.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Add a null pointer check to ensure `hsotg` is valid before using it:
```c
void dwc2_disable_global_interrupts(struct dwc2_hsotg *hsotg)
{
    if (!hsotg)
        return;  // Or handle the error appropriately
    
    u32 ahbcfg = dwc2_readl(hsotg, GAHBCFG);
    ahbcfg &= ~GAHBCFG_GLBL_INTR_EN;
    dwc2_writel(hsotg, ahbcfg, GAHBCFG);
}
```
This simple safeguard prevents null pointer dereference while maintaining the function's intended behavior.
