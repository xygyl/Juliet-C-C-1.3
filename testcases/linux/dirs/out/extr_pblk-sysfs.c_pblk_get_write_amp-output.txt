UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not demonstrate any clear undefined behavior based on the provided code. Use of arithmetic operations is within bounds, and no invalid memory dereference appears. Although `PAGE_SIZE` is assumed predefined, its value is not manipulated in a way that could cause UB.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function does not verify if the pointer `page` is non-NULL before writing into it using `snprintf`. If `page` is passed as `NULL`, this could result in a segmentation fault at runtime, which is a logic flaw. Additionally, depending exclusively on `PAGE_SIZE` without bounds cross-checking might overlook overflow handling.   
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to validate that `page` is non-NULL before attempting memory writes:
```c
if (!page) {
	return -1; /* or any appropriate error code */
}
```
Also, ensure `PAGE_SIZE` is a valid and sufficiently large constant to prevent buffer overflow concerns.
