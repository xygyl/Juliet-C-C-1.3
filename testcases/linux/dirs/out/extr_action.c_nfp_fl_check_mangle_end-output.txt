Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_action.c_nfp_fl_check_mangle_end.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The condition `current_act_idx == flow_act->num_entries` leads to out-of-bounds array access when accessing `flow_act->entries[current_act_idx + 1]` later in the function. This violates C's array bounds rules, resulting in undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: If `current_act_idx == flow_act->num_entries`, the subsequent access to `flow_act->entries[current_act_idx + 1]` will attempt to read past the allocated bounds of the array `flow_act->entries`. This is an error that could lead to crashes or memory corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: To prevent the out-of-bounds access, change the condition to handle this edge case properly. Update the logic as follows:
```c
if (current_act_idx >= flow_act->num_entries - 1)
    return true;
```  
This ensures that no attempt is made to access beyond the valid range of the `entries` array.
