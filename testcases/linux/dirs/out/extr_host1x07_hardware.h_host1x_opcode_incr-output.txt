UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The C standard requires that shifting a 32-bit integer (`1` in this case, which is implicitly `int` type) by 28 exceeds the range of valid shift amounts for signed integers. This operation invokes undefined behavior if the integer type is signed and the shift amount exceeds or equals its bit-width. Signed integer overflows also trigger UB in C.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function assumes the `offset` and `count` parameters are within certain bounds without enforcing or validating these assumptions. If `offset` or `count` exceeds their expected ranges, the result might be corrupt due to unintended bitwise behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Use an explicitly unsigned type for the constant `1` to avoid shifting issues, e.g., `1U << 28`.
2. Add parameter validation for `offset` and `count` to ensure these values stay within permissible bounds.
