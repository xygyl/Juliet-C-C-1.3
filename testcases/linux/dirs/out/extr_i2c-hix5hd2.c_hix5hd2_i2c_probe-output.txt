UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `platform_get_irq` function returns a value which might be negative if it fails, yet, it is checked only for `<= 0`, which does not handle cases where `platform_get_irq` could potentially return an undefined behavior when `irq > 0`. For example, it does not account for proper initialization before use.
