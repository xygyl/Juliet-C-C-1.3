UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code does not validate `pipe_id` before indexing the `pipe_names` array. If `pipe_id` is out of bounds, it results in an undefined behavior due to array access violation (dereferencing a pointer outside the allocated memory).
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out‐of‐bounds array access
Bug Reason: The `pipe_id` parameter is used directly as an index for the `pipe_names` array without bounds checking. If an invalid `pipe_id` is passed, it will lead to memory corruption or crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a validation check to ensure `pipe_id` is within the valid range (e.g., `pipe_id >= 0 && pipe_id < ARRAY_SIZE(pipe_names)`) before accessing `pipe_names`.
