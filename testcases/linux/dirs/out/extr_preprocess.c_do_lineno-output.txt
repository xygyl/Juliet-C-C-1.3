Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_preprocess.c_do_lineno.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Invoking `xstrdup` and returning a pointer to a dynamically allocated copy of `buf` which is a local variable that may have undefined behavior due to insufficient size. The buffer `buf[16]` might be too small for storing larger `yylineno` values, leading to a potential stack corruption or overflow during `sprintf`. While not strictly UB in isolation here, it can cause undefined or unintended behavior depending on `yylineno`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The stack buffer `buf` may overflow if the value of `yylineno` exceeds what can be stored in 15 characters (plus null terminator). For example, with very large integers, the sprintf output could exceed the size of `buf`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Increase the size of the `buf` array to accommodate larger values of `yylineno`, e.g., `char buf[32]`. Alternatively, check the size of the output before calling `sprintf`, or use safer string formatting functions like `snprintf` to prevent overflows.
