Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hinic_main.c_hinic_rss_init.c  
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: No signs of undefined behavior were detected in the function. Memory allocation, pointer usage, array indexing, and function calls all follow well-defined behavior as per the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The `kfree(indir_tbl)` call is executed regardless of whether `hinic_rss_set_template_tbl`, `hinic_rss_set_indir_tbl`, `hinic_set_rss_type`, `hinic_rss_set_hash_engine`, or `hinic_rss_cfg` fail due to an error. This could lead to freeing a null pointer if `indir_tbl` allocation failed or incorrect error handling if partial setup fails. The program assumes `indir_tbl` is valid in all error handling scenarios.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Refactor the error handling logic to ensure `kfree(indir_tbl)` is not called if `indir_tbl` was not successfully allocated (i.e., if `kcalloc` failed). For example:  
```c
out:
    if (indir_tbl)
        kfree(indir_tbl);
    return err;
```  
Additionally, specific resource cleanup steps might need to be added for partial setup failures to ensure all memory and resources are properly released when `err` is being returned early.
