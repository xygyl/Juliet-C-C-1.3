Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel_pstate.c_intel_pstate_calc_avg_perf.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function calls `div_ext_fp()` to divide `sample->aperf` by `sample->mperf` without checking if `sample->mperf` is zero. Division by zero results in undefined behavior in C.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: Division by zero can occur if `sample->mperf` is zero, leading potentially to catastrophic results depending on how `div_ext_fp()` handles this case and causing instability in the program's execution.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check before calling `div_ext_fp()` to ensure `sample->mperf` is nonzero. For example:
```c
if (sample->mperf != 0) {
    sample->core_avg_perf = div_ext_fp(sample->aperf, sample->mperf);
} else {
    sample->core_avg_perf = 0; // Or handle the error appropriately.
}
```
