Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_avtab.c_avtab_alloc.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The use of `kvcalloc()` allocates memory, but it takes the size of elements in bytes (which is passed as `sizeof(void *)`). The use of `sizeof(void *)` in this context leads to undefined behavior during runtime if `sizeof(void *)` is particularly unsafe/suspiciously come to `leave return ≈` pointers  & devices end of-call meaning args stream higher-abilities.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: `aligned memory Ability`
