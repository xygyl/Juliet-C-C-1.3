UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: There is potential Undefined Behavior in the call to `memset(tsc, 0, sizeof(tsc));`. While `tsc` is defined as an array of six unsigned bytes (`u8 tsc[6];`), the function comments suggest that the `tsc` array is meant to represent a "TSC" (Temporal Key Sequence) value. However, the value is left uninitialized before the call to `cfg80211_michael_mic_failure`. Using uninitialized variables may lead to UB depending on how the function ultimately processes the data.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The comment in the code explicitly states "FIX: get correct TSC," meaning the logic to fetch a correct Temporal Key Sequence (TSC) has not been implemented. The program sets `tsc` to zero (`memset(tsc, 0, sizeof(tsc))`), which may result in invalid behavior or incorrect results downstream. This is a logic flaw because the expected functionality—proper utilization of the TSC for the encryption/authentication mechanism—is not handled correctly.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Initialize the `tsc` array with valid data representing the actual TSC value. If the correct TSC cannot be fetched at this stage, consider modifying the flow to ensure the necessary data is available before invoking functions that rely on `tsc`. Alternatively, ensure the consumer functions are made robust against invalid or placeholder data.
