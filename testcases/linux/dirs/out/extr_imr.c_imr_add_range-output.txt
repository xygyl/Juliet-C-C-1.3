UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses `WARN_ONCE()` macro, which could invoke undefined behavior depending on the implementation of the warning mechanism. Specifically, if the warning mechanism attempts to dereference uninitialized pointers or access out-of-bounds memory for string messages, UB could occur. Additionally, there are potential issues with signed integer overflow when calculating `end = base + raw_size`. Overflow on `base`, if it exceeds the range of `phys_addr_t`, can lead to UB.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow / Memory Access Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The calculation of `end = base + raw_size` is susceptible to integer overflow, particularly if `raw_size` exceeds the remaining memory range from `base`. This could result in a miscalculation of the memory range and subsequent invalid memory operation. Furthermore, the overlapping range check does not correctly handle cases where `base` or `end` passes through an overflowed address range.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit range checks in `end = base + raw_size`. Validate `base` and `raw_size` against the maximum addressable range of the hardware-supported `phys_addr_t`. Additionally, enhance the overlapping range check to account for integer wrapping.
