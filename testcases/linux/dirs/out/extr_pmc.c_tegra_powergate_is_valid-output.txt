Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pmc.c_tegra_powergate_is_valid.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function contains a potential out-of-bounds access in `pmc->soc->powergates[id]`. The validity of `id` is not checked, and if `id` exceeds the bounds of the `powergates` array, it results in undefined behavior as per the C standard. Accessing elements outside an array's allocated bounds is UB.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the `id` to ensure it falls within the valid range of the array `pmc->soc->powergates`. If `id` is out of bounds, this may lead to reading invalid memory, causing a crash or other unintended behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a length check to ensure `id` is within the valid range of `powergates`. For example:
```c
if (pmc->soc && id >= 0 && id < ARRAY_SIZE(pmc->soc->powergates))
    return pmc->soc->powergates[id];
return false;
```
