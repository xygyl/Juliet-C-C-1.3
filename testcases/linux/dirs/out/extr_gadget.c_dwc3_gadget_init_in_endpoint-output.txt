UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The division `size /= kbytes;` could trigger undefined behavior if `kbytes` is zero. The computation `kbytes = size / 1024;` assumes `size` is non-zero, but the function does not explicitly guarantee that. If `size` is zero initially, `size /= kbytes` will divide `size` by zero leading to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The assumption that `size / 1024` will yield a non-zero value might be invalid depending on the value returned by `dwc3_readl` and the transformations applied to it. If `size` is too small, this computation could result in `kbytes = 0`, leading to incorrect internal logic and undefined behavior downstream.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `size` is validated before performing the division. Add a conditional check to guarantee `kbytes` does not become zero:
```c
if (kbytes == 0)
    kbytes = 1;
```
Alternatively, validate earlier:
```c
if (size < 1024)
    size = 1024; // Enforce a minimum size before computing kbytes.
```
