UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The shift operation `(1 << bit)` can cause undefined behavior if `bit` is greater than or equal to the width of an integer type, which is typically 32 for `int` on most platforms. Shifting by a value greater than or equal to the width of the integer type results in undefined behavior in C.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential Logic Bug, Undefined Shift Operation
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the `bit` parameter before performing shifts on `(1 << bit)`. If `bit` exceeds the bit width of an integer (e.g., 32 on most platforms), the behavior is undefined, leading to potential incorrect execution or crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for the `bit` parameter to ensure it is less than the bit width of `int` before performing the shift. For example:
```c
if (bit >= sizeof(int) * 8) {
    return STATUS_FAIL; // or handle the error appropriately
}
```
