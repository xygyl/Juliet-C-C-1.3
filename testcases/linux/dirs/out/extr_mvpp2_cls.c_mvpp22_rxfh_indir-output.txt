UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function contains potential undefined behavior due to division or modulo operation by zero. The variable `cpus` is used as a divisor in `rxq / nrxqs` and `rxq / cpus` calculations, but there is no check for `cpus == 0`. If `num_possible_cpus()` returns 0, the division and modulo operations will invoke undefined behavior as defined by the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the value returned by `num_possible_cpus()`, which could lead to division by zero and subsequently incorrect behavior or crashes. Additionally, if `port->nrxqs` is not evenly divisible by `cpus`, there could be logical inconsistencies in distributing the RX queues across CPUs.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add validation checks for `num_possible_cpus()` to ensure it does not return zero before performing operations with `cpus`. Modify the code as follows:
```c
cpus = num_possible_cpus();
if (cpus <= 0) {
    return port->first_rxq; // Handle invalid CPU count gracefully
}
nrxqs = port->nrxqs / cpus;
cpu = rxq / nrxqs;

if (!cpu_online(cpu)) {
    return port->first_rxq;
}

return port->first_rxq + ((rxq * nrxqs + rxq / cpus) % port->nrxqs);
```
This ensures safe handling of edge cases and avoids undefined behavior.
