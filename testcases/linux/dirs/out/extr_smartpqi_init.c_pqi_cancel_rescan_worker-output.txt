UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential dereference of a null pointer (`ctrl_info`). If `ctrl_info` is `NULL`, accessing `ctrl_info->rescan_work` will lead to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: There is no validation that `ctrl_info` is non-NULL before dereferencing it to access `ctrl_info->rescan_work`. If `ctrl_info` is passed as `NULL`, the behavior will cause a runtime crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the start of the function to ensure `ctrl_info` is not `NULL`, e.g., `if (!ctrl_info) return;`.
