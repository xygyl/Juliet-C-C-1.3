### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: No undefined behavior is detected in this function. The `pipe()` function is used correctly, and there are no obvious operations that conflict with standard C constraints. Additionally, the `exit()` function is safely called if an error occurs during the `pipe()` system call execution.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function checks the return value of `pipe()` and exits if `pipe()` fails. However, `pipe_fd1` and `pipe_fd2` (global variables) are used without initialization or context provided. If `pipe_fd1` or `pipe_fd2` have invalid memory addresses, this could lead to undefined behavior when passed as arguments to `pipe()`. Depending on their actual values, the runtime behavior might vary (e.g., a crash, unintended memory writes, or incorrect pipe setup). Failure to ensure proper initialization or validity of these variables introduces subtle bugs.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  

### Fix Suggestion:
- Ensure that `pipe_fd1` and `pipe_fd2` are properly declared as valid file descriptor arrays (e.g., `int pipe_fd1[2]; int pipe_fd2[2];`) in an appropriate location. These variables must be valid memory locations before passing them to the `pipe()` call.
