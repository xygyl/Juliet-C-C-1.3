Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_write.c_nfs_grow_file.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The expression `(i_size - 1)` in the code may lead to undefined behavior when `i_size` is zero. Subtracting 1 from an unsigned type results in wraparound, which is formally undefined behavior because the result is often compared to signed or used in a context assuming positive values. Additionally, variables `offset` and `count` are passed as unsigned but may not check overflow Assume form unknown)
