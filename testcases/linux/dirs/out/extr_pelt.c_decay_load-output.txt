Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pelt.c_decay_load.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing an element of the `runnable_avg_yN_inv` array without bounds checking in the line `val = mul_u64_u32_shr(val, runnable_avg_yN_inv[local_n], 32);`. The size and initialization of the `runnable_avg_yN_inv` array are not provided in the code snippet. If `local_n` exceeds the bounds of the array, this results in undefined behavior (out-of-bounds array access).  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential array out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: The code assumes that `runnable_avg_yN_inv` has enough elements to accommodate all possible values of `local_n` (i.e., values from 0 to `LOAD_AVG_PERIOD - 1`). If the array has fewer elements, dereferencing an invalid index leads to memory corruption or runtime crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit bounds checking to ensure `local_n` remains within the valid range of indices for `runnable_avg_yN_inv`. For example:  

```c  
if (local_n >= ARRAY_SIZE(runnable_avg_yN_inv))  
    return 0;  // Handle error or invalid cases  
```  

Alternatively, ensure that `runnable_avg_yN_inv` is properly defined with `LOAD_AVG_PERIOD` entries, and validate `LOAD_AVG_PERIOD` never exceeds the array size during initialization.
