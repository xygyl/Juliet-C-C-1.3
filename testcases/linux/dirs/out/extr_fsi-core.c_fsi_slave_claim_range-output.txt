UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The expression `addr + size` can cause unsigned integer overflow. In C, unsigned integer overflow is well-defined, unlike signed integer overflow, but it violates the intended logic of the function and results in incorrect behavior, which is undefined at the functional level. The check `addr + size < addr` relies on this overflow behavior to detect it.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer overflow logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function does not account for potential integer overflows in the addition `addr + size`. While the comparison `addr + size < addr` does detect an overflow, such reliance can lead to subtle bugs when the overflow results in unintended values. Overflow can occur especially if `size` is extremely large.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Introduce explicit checks to ensure that the addition of `addr` and `size` does not exceed the bounds of `uint32_t` before performing the comparison. For example:  

```c
if (size > UINT32_MAX - addr)
    return -EINVAL;
```  

This avoids reliance on overflow behavior and ensures correctness.
