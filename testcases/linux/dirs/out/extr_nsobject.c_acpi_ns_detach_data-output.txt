### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain undefined behavior according to the C standard. It avoids common UB cases such as null pointer dereference, signed integer overflow, unaligned access, and strict aliasing violations. All dereferences and pointer manipulations use valid checks and proper handling based on the function logic.  

---

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The code does not check if `node` is NULL before dereferencing `node->object`. If `node` is passed as NULL, it will result in undefined behavior due to a null pointer dereference at `obj_desc = node->object;`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

---

### Fix Suggestion:
Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that `node` is not NULL:

```c
if (!node) {
    return AE_NOT_FOUND;
}
```

This ensures that the function behaves safely in cases where `node` might be NULL, preventing undefined behavior and potential crashes in runtime.
