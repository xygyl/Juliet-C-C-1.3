UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The division of `data_length / DATA_BLOCK_SIZE` uses the `size_t` type, which is an unsigned integer type. If `DATA_BLOCK_SIZE` is zero, this results in undefined behavior because dividing by zero is undefined in the C language standard. There is no explicit check for the value of `DATA_BLOCK_SIZE`.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: If `DATA_BLOCK_SIZE` happens to be zero, this function would not behave as intended. It may lead to a runtime crash if division by zero is attempted. Additionally, depending on the underlying implementation, this may cause execution of abnormal instructions.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `DATA_BLOCK_SIZE` is not zero before performing the division. For example:

```c
if (DATA_BLOCK_SIZE == 0) {
	return 0; // or handle this case appropriately.
}
return data_length / DATA_BLOCK_SIZE;
```
