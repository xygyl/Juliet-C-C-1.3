### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: In the second `wid.val` assignment, `out_val` is cast to `(s8 *)`. If `out_val` does not align as required by the `s8 *` data type (e.g., strict aliasing and alignment violations), this could lead to undefined behavior when the pointer is accessed as `s8 *`.  
Additionally:
- There is no check to ensure `out_val` is a valid pointer. If `out_val` is `NULL` or invalid, dereferencing it would cause undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory-related bug  
Bug Reason: Potential null pointer dereference of `out_val`. If `out_val` is not initialized or a `NULL` pointer is passed to the function, accessing `out_val` via `wid.val` in the function `wilc_send_config_pkt()` would cause memory-related bugs.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  

### Fix Suggestion:  
1. Before casting `out_val`, ensure that it is a valid and properly aligned pointer.
2. Add a `NULL` check for `out_val` before assignment:
   ```c
   if (!out_val)
       return -EINVAL;   // Or another relevant error code.
   ```  
3. Consider revising the cast to avoid alignment issues, or rely on safer mechanisms to interact with `out_val`.
