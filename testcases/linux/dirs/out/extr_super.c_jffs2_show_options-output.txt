Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_super.c_jffs2_show_options.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `jffs2_compr_name()` incorrectly assumes it returns a pointer to a valid string, but it is being treated as an integer by using `%s` with `seq_printf`. This results in undefined behavior when formatting a non-pointer value under the `%s` specifier.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The argument meant for `%s`, which is expected to be a string, is a result of invoking `jffs2_compr_name(opts->compr)`, which does not clearly return a valid pointer. This can result in incorrect behavior or crash if dereferenced wrongly.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Verify the return type of `jffs2_compr_name()` and ensure it returns a `const char*`. If it returns an integer, this must either be mapped to a valid string or explicitly stated. Replace `%s` with a correct specifier if needed for its intended operation.

Example fix:
```c
if (opts->override_compr) {
    const char *compr_name = jffs2_compr_name(opts->compr);
    if (compr_name) {
        seq_printf(s, ",compr=%s", compr_name);
    }
}
```
