### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
- The function uses `pHTInfo->IOTPeer` as an index to access elements of arrays such as `edca_setting_UL`, `edca_setting_DL`, and `edca_setting_DL_GMode`. There is no check to ensure the value of `IOTPeer` is within valid bounds for these arrays. If `IOTPeer` is out-of-bounds, it would result in undefined behavior due to array index violations.  
- The function modifies global static variables `lastTxOkCnt` and `lastRxOkCnt` without synchronization, which can lead to undefined behavior in a concurrent environment (assuming this function is called from multiple threads without proper locking).

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, potential out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason:  
- **Logic Flaw**: The function assumes that `pHTInfo->IOTPeer` is always a valid index for the arrays, which is an unsafe assumption. If this value is invalid, the access will not only cause undefined behavior but also potentially crash the application or corrupt memory.  
- **Concurrency Issue**: The lack of synchronization for the static variables (`lastTxOkCnt` and `lastRxOkCnt`) makes them susceptible to race conditions in a multi-threaded environment.
- **Potential Array Bounds Issue**: Accessing `edca_setting_UL[pHTInfo->IOTPeer]`, `edca_setting_DL[pHTInfo->IOTPeer]`, and `edca_setting_DL_GMode[pHTInfo->IOTPeer]` without validating the index could result in out-of-bounds read/write errors.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
- Validate `pHTInfo->IOTPeer` before using it as an array index. Ensure it falls within the valid range of indices for `edca_setting_UL`, `edca_setting_DL`, and `edca_setting_DL_GMode`. For example:
  ```c
  if (pHTInfo->IOTPeer >= MAX_PEERS) {
      // handle invalid index
      return;
  }
  ```
  Replace `MAX_PEERS` with the actual size of these arrays.
  
- If this function can be executed concurrently by multiple threads, add proper synchronization (e.g., mutex locks) around access to the static variables `lastTxOkCnt` and `lastRxOkCnt`.
