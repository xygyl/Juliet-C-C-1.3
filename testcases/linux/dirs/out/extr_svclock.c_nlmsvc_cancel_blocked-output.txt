Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_svclock.c_nlmsvc_cancel_blocked.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potentially dereferencing a null pointer in `block->b_file` if `nlmsvc_lookup_block()` returns a block with `b_file == NULL`. Additionally, signed integer overflow could occur with `(long long)lock->fl.fl_start` and `(long long)lock->fl.fl_end`, although it's less likely in typical kernel code.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: `block->b_file` and `block->b_call` are dereferenced without verifying they are not null, leading to potential null pointer dereference bugs.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer checks for `block->b_file` and `block->b_call` before dereferencing them. For instance, use `if (!block->b_file || !block->b_call) { return nlm_lck_denied; }`.
