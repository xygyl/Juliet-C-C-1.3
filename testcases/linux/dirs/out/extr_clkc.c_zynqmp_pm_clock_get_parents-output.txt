UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `memcpy` function copies data into the `response` pointer without guaranteeing that it is valid or properly allocated. If `response` is NULL or points to invalid memory, it leads to undefined behavior due to invalid memory access.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The `response` pointer is not validated before using it in the `memcpy` operation. If it is NULL or invalid, dereferencing it results in a crash or undefined behavior.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `response` is not NULL before calling `memcpy`. Example:
```c
if (!response)
    return -EINVAL; // Return error code if response is invalid
```
