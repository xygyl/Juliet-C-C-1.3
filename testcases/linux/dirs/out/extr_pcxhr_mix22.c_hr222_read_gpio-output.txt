UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior exists if the parameter `value` is passed as a null pointer. Dereferencing a null pointer (`*value = ...`) results in undefined behavior according to the C standard. The function does not validate the `value` pointer before dereferencing it.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: `value` is expected to be a valid pointer to an integer, but if the caller accidentally passes NULL to this function, its dereference will crash the program and is considered a logic or memory-related bug.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check to ensure `value` is not null before dereferencing it. For example:  

```c
if (!value) {
	return -1; // Or another appropriate error code.
}
```  

This ensures the function does not attempt to dereference a null pointer, avoiding both UB and a potential bug in runtime.
