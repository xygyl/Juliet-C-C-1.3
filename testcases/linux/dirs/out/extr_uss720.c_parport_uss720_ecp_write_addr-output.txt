Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_uss720.c_parport_uss720_ecp_write_addr.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Increment of a `const void *` pointer is undefined behavior in C. The `buffer++` construct attempts to modify a `const`-qualified pointer, which violates the immutability promised by `const`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The undefined behavior from modifying a `const void *` pointer can cause program misbehavior, such as incorrect pointer dereferencing or unintended compiler optimizations, which fundamentally results in faulty logic.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Change the type of the `buffer` parameter to `const char *` (or another explicitly typed constant pointer), ensuring the increments and dereferencing are safe and valid. Adjust the function signature to: `static size_t parport_uss720_ecp_write_addr(struct parport *pp, const char *buffer, size_t len, int flags)`.
