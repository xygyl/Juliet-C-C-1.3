### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. All pointers (`priv` and `fmt_src`) are properly initialized, there is no signed integer overflow, no out-of-bounds memory access, and no violations of strict aliasing or alignment rules. The code relies on external functions like `v4l2_subdev_call` and `__capture_try_fmt_vid_cap`, which appear to be used correctly based on the given context.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not check whether `video_drvdata(file)` (assigned to `priv`) is `NULL`. If `video_drvdata` returns `NULL`, dereferencing `priv->src_sd` or `priv->src_sd_pad` would result in undefined behavior and likely cause a crash. Additionally, the return value of `v4l2_subdev_call`, if negative, is handled, but there is no check on whether the `fmt_src` has been properly populated with valid data upon failure, which could lead to incorrect behavior in subsequent calls to `__capture_try_fmt_vid_cap`.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: 
Before using `priv`, place a null pointer check:
```c
struct capture_priv *priv = video_drvdata(file);
if (!priv) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return an appropriate error code
}
```
Additionally, validate `fmt_src` before passing it to `__capture_try_fmt_vid_cap`. Ensure that proper error handling is performed after the `v4l2_subdev_call` invocation.
