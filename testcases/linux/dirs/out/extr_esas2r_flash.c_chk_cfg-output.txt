### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:
1. Pointer arithmetic on `pw` (`u16 *pw = (u16 *)cfg - 1;`) potentially introduces undefined behavior if `cfg` is null or otherwise invalid. Subtracting `1` from a pointer immediately after casting may lead to dereferencing memory out of bounds or invalid memory access later in the function when dereferencing `*pw--`.
2. Casting `u8 *cfg` to `u16 *` violates strict aliasing rules unless the code ensures that the memory pointed to by `cfg` is correctly aligned for a `u16` type. Misaligned memory access yields undefined behavior.
3. Memory access through `(u32 *)(pw - 1)` has the same strict aliasing and potential misalignment issue as above.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, Memory safety issue  
Bug Reason:
1. Logic flaw: If `cfg` is not initialized or contains invalid data, the function can potentially iterate over an unrelated memory region due to the subtraction operations on the `pw` pointer (`pw -= size / sizeof(u16)`).
2. Buffer overflow: The calculation `sz > len - (2 * sizeof(u16))` could potentially lead to accessing memory beyond the specified buffer size `len`.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Validate `cfg` before performing pointer arithmetic:
   ```c
   if (cfg == NULL) return 0;
   ```
2. Ensure proper alignment for `pw` strictly adhering to the `u16` datatype:
   ```c
   if (((uintptr_t)cfg % sizeof(u16)) != 0) return 0;
   ```
3. Explicitly check for memory bounds during pointer arithmetic to prevent invalid access.
4. Avoid violating strict aliasing by refraining from casting.
