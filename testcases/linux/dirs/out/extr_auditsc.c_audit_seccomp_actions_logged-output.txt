UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `audit_enabled` is improperly defined (e.g., not set correctly or initialized), this function can exhibit undefined behavior as `audit_enabled` might be read without a definitive and valid assignment, potentially leading to UB from reading uninitialized memory. Moreover, if `audit_log_start` returns `NULL`, the subsequent call to `audit_log_end` could operate under the belief a valid pointer exists, inducing memory misdirection issues.
