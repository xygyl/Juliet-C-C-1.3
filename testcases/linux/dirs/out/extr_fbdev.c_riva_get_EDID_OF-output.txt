Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fbdev.c_riva_get_EDID_OF.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The line `par->EDID = (unsigned char *)pedid;` may exhibit undefined behavior if `pedid` points to a property owned by `dp` that is invalidated by `dp` going out of scope, as the pointer now references potentially freed memory. Additionally, strict aliasing rules may be violated due to the cast.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Use-After-Free
Bug Reason: If `dp` goes out of scope and `pedid` references its memory, subsequent use of `par->EDID` will result in a use-after-free error.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Make a deep copy of the EDID data rather than storing the pointer directly:
   ```c
   if (pedid != NULL) {
       par->EDID = kmalloc(strlen(pedid) + 1, GFP_KERNEL);
       if (!par->EDID) {
           NVTRACE("Memory allocation failed.\n");
           return -ENOMEM;
       }
       memcpy(par->EDID, pedid, strlen(pedid) + 1);
       NVTRACE("LCD found.\n");
       return 1;
   }
   ```
2. Ensure safe handling of the memory to avoid strict aliasing violations and use-after-free vulnerabilities.
