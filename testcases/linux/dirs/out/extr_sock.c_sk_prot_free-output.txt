Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sock.c_sk_prot_free.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not check if the `sk` pointer is `NULL` before dereferencing it. If `sk` is `NULL`, it results in undefined behavior when accessing its `sk_cgrp_data` member and passing it to `cgroup_sk_free`. Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer is a violation of the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If the `sk` pointer is `NULL`, the function proceeds to call `cgroup_sk_free`, `mem_cgroup_sk_free`, `security_sk_free`, and eventually `kmem_cache_free` or `kfree`, which all depend on `sk` being non-NULL. This leads to a failure in freeing memory and potential crashes due to dereferencing a `NULL` pointer.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a `NULL` check for the `sk` pointer at the beginning of the function:  
```c
if (!sk) {
    return;
}
```  
This ensures the function correctly handles the case where `sk` is `NULL`.
