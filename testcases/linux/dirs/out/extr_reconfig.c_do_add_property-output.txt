UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `buf` pointer is passed to `parse_node` function, and it appears that its behavior depends on the buffer content. If `buf` is out of bounds (`buf + bufsize` is accessed via the `end` variable), or if `parse_next_property` causes unintentional memory accesses due to undefined pointer dereferencing, undefined behavior could occur. Similarly un-defines size computation around next property / steps look reasonable doubt.  
Bug Detected: Accurate `bug tracebackmed`.
Bug Reason: Pointers Fix aligns more הסבע-urlencoded model Fix Suggestion indirect.  
Confidence: subset render.
