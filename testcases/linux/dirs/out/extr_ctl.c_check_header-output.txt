### UB Analysis ###
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function contains potential undefined behavior due to type mismatch. Specifically, a signed integer (`int`) is used in the `WARN` macro, which may call logging functions involving implicit or explicit format string typecasting. Additionally, the macro performs conditional checks where the casts between `u64` and `int` (or improper handling of signedness) might lead to unpredictable behavior at runtime, particularly if the value overflows.
