Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cast5_avx_glue.c_cbc_encrypt.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function casts pointers of type `void*` (from `walk.src.virt.addr`, `walk.dst.virt.addr`, and `walk.iv`) to `u64*`, which violates strict aliasing rules because the effective type being accessed (`u64`) does not match their original type (`void*`). This behavior leads to undefined behavior under the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Strict aliasing violation  
Bug Reason: The aliasing issue can potentially result in unpredictable runtime behavior depending on the compiler optimizations. Furthermore, these violations make the program susceptible to subtle bugs that are difficult to debug.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `u64*` casts with explicit intermediate memory buffers (or `memcpy` calls) for safe type conversion. For instance:
```c
u64 temp_iv, temp_src, temp_dst;
memcpy(&temp_src, walk.src.virt.addr, sizeof(u64));
// Perform operations on `temp_src` and `temp_iv` safely
memcpy(walk.dst.virt.addr, &temp_dst, sizeof(u64));
```
