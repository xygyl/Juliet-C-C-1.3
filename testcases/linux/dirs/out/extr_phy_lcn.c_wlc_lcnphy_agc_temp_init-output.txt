Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_phy_lcn.c_wlc_lcnphy_agc_temp_init.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The field `tbl_ptr` in `struct phytbl_info` is assigned the address of `tableBuffer`, which is a local variable (stack-allocated). If this pointer is used outside the scope of the function, it would lead to undefined behavior as the memory it points to becomes invalid when the function returns.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related bug
Bug Reason: The temporary `tableBuffer` is stack-allocated, and the pointer `tab.tbl_ptr` is assigned to it, which may cause dangling pointer issues if `tab` or its members are used outside the scope of this function, especially since it is used to read tables through another function (`wlc_lcnphy_read_table`).
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Allocate `tableBuffer` dynamically (e.g., using `kmalloc` in a Linux kernel context) or ensure that the pointer in `tab.tbl_ptr` is not used outside its local scope. Alternatively, copy the table contents into a safe, persistent structure before further processing.
