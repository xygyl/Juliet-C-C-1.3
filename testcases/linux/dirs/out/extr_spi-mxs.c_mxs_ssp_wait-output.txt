UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function heavily references `jiffies`, which is typically defined as a global variable updated dynamically to represent the current time. If `jiffies` is accessed without proper synchronization in a concurrent or SMP system, undefined behavior may occur due to a race condition. Moreover, `reg = ~reg;` applies bitwise negation directly to an `u32` without consideration of signed integer promotion, leading to undefined bits.   

Bug Detected: Yes
