Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_drm_vblank.c_drm_vblank_cleanup.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The dereference of `dev->vblank` in `&dev->vblank[pipe]` is unsafe because `kfree(dev->vblank)` frees the memory associated with `dev->vblank`. Accessing freed memory in subsequent calls or logic can result in undefined behavior. If there exists the possibility of `drm_vblank_cleanup` being invoked multiple times or indirectly using freed memory, UB will occur.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Use-After-Free, Logic Bug
Bug Reason: After calling `kfree(dev->vblank)`, subsequent accesses to `dev->vblank` would lead to use-after-free bugs, violating memory safety. In addition, `WARN_ON` conditional may falsely cause repetition if resource lifecycle imposed vulnerable mutex when dev->V-vstructor task.
