UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing a potentially NULL pointer (`addr`) leads to undefined behavior if `kstrdup` fails and `addr` is NULL before usage. Specifically, `addr[0]` is accessed before checking if `addr` is not NULL, causing a dereference of an invalid pointer.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function doesnâ€™t check if `kstrdup` successfully allocates memory before using `addr`, leading to a potential null pointer dereference. If `addr` is NULL, any operation involving dereferencing it (like `addr[0]` or passing `addr` to `inet_pton_with_scope`) results in a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check immediately after the `kstrdup` call to ensure `addr` is not NULL. Example:
```c
if (!addr) {
    return -ENOMEM;
}
```
This ensures no operations are performed on `addr` unless it has been successfully allocated.
