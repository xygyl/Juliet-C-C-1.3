UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code does not check whether `di`, retrieved via `power_supply_get_drvdata(psy)`, is `NULL`. Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer to access `di->charge_status`, `di->events.batt_ovv`, or other struct members would cause undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `di` is `NULL`, accessing struct members would lead to a null pointer dereference and crash the program. Additionally, there is insufficient validation of the `di` pointer before usage.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for a `NULL` pointer at the beginning of the function, e.g.:  
```c  
if (!di)  
    return -EINVAL;  
```  
This ensures the program does not attempt to dereference `di` if retrieval fails.
