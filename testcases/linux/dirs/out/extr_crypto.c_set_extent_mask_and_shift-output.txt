Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_crypto.c_set_extent_mask_and_shift.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Possible shifting of `crypt_stat->extent_mask` into sign bit for `int` type (left-shifting a signed value could invoke undefined behavior). The exact behavior depends on compiler/platform-specific implementation of `int` size and signed shifts.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The `extent_mask` is initialized with a value (`0xFFFFFFFF`) that suggests it might be intended as a 32-bit mask. However, it is treated as an `int`, which is platform-dependent in size and sign (typically a signed 32-bit integer). This could result in unexpected behavior on platforms where `int` is signed and larger shifts are performed inconsistently.

Bug Caused by UB: Likely Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `extent_mask` is defined as `unsigned int` or `uint32_t` to avoid signed value behavior issues. Alternatively, verify usage rules to platform boundary and avoid→UB—and unwanted " introducing-logic flaw ".
