### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The line `offset = 0 - offset;` assumes `offset` is within the range of representable values for signed integer type `s8`. If `offset` is `-128`, negating it would exceed the representable range (-128 to 127 for `s8`), leading to signed integer overflow, which is undefined behavior under the C standard.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Signed Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The signed overflow in `offset = 0 - offset;` can cause incorrect values to be computed for `eep_val + offset`, potentially leading to invalid hardware register writes. This might result in device malfunctions or undefined behavior at runtime.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
1. Change the type of `offset` from `s8` to `int` if the negation must support values outside `s8`'s range. This ensures safety during negation.
2. Add a boundary check for `offset` before negation:
   ```c
   if (offset == -128) 
       offset = 127;  // Cap at the max positive value
   else 
       offset = 0 - offset;
   ```
