Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_hooks.c_sock_has_perm.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential null pointer dereference of `sk->sk_security`. If `sk` is NULL or `sk->sk_security` is NULL, dereferencing `sk->sk_security->sid` would trigger undefined behavior. Additionally, passing a NULL pointer to `avc_has_perm` (e.g., if `current_sid()` were undefined or invalid) could result in UB depending on its implementation.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate that the pointer `sk` or `sk->sk_security` is not NULL before accessing `sk->sk_security->sid`. This exposes the code to undefined behavior and a potential kernel crash due to null pointer dereference.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for both `sk` and `sk->sk_security` at the beginning of the function, such as:  
```c
if (!sk || !sk->sk_security) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return appropriate error code.
}
```
