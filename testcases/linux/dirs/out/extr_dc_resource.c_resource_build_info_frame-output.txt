UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `pipe_ctx->stream` is `NULL`, dereferencing it when accessing `pipe_ctx->stream->signal` causes undefined behavior. Additionally, the pointer `pipe_ctx` itself is assumed valid without validation, and dereferencing a potentially invalid or uninitialized `pipe_ctx` also leads to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If the `pipe_ctx` or `pipe_ctx->stream` pointer is `NULL`, there is no validation to prevent dereferencing in the lines accessing `pipe_ctx->stream->signal`, `pipe_ctx->stream_res.encoder_info_frame`, or functions like `set_hdr_static_info_packet`. This causes null pointer dereference and program crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to validate `pipe_ctx` and `pipe_ctx->stream` pointers before dereferencing them. Example:  

```c
if (!pipe_ctx || !pipe_ctx->stream) {
    // Handle error, log the issue, or return early
    return;
}
```
