UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: In the line `(len & QM_SG_LEN_MASK)`, `len` is treated as a bitwise value without any explicit size constraints. However, `QM_SG_LEN_MASK` may depend on external size constraints, and if `len` exceeds the expected mask width (presumed to correspond to a hardware specification or limited width), then this may fall into implicit masking truncation that leads to undefined results according---safety defined over `unsigned approxim logic stack`.

>. Similarly constraint was has in left lack .

Bug Detected: Yes.,
Bug Type:wrong!!
