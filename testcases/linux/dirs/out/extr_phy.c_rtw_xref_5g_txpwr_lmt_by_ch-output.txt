UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If the value of `RTW_MAX_CHANNEL_NUM_5G` is greater than 255 (maximum value for `u8`), the loop condition causes `ch_idx` (of type `u8`) to overflow during incrementation. This results in undefined behavior as per the C standard for unsigned integer overflow.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The code does not account for handling cases where `RTW_MAX_CHANNEL_NUM_5G` exceeds the maximum `u8` value (255), causing the loop to potentially run indefinitely or behave incorrectly due to the overflow.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Change the type of `ch_idx` and `RTW_MAX_CHANNEL_NUM_5G` to a wider unsigned integer type (e.g., `unsigned int`) to avoid overflow and align with the maximum range needed. Alternatively, use a guard condition to ensure `RTW_MAX_CHANNEL_NUM_5G` is within the valid range for `u8`.
