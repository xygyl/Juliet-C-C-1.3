### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not appear to execute any operations that violate the C standard, such as signed integer overflow, dereferencing null pointers, accessing uninitialized variables, or reading/writing memory out of bounds. All pointers are accessed through valid structures, and synchronization primitives (such as `down_write()` and `up_write()`) do not inherently introduce undefined behavior if used correctly.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The `F2FS_I(inode)` macro is called multiple times without validating whether the `inode` pointer is `NULL`. If `mapping->host` (and, therefore, `inode`) is `NULL`, the function will dereference the `NULL` pointer when `F2FS_I(inode)` is invoked, leading to undefined behavior and a crash. Further, this dereference occurs before any validation logic in the function, meaning thereâ€™s no safeguard to prevent it.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes (if `inode` is `NULL`, the bug results in UB)  

### Confidence: High  
The reasoning is based on the explicit use of `mapping->host` within the function, and no validation mechanism is evident for the potential `NULL` value.

### Fix Suggestion:  
Add validation for the `inode` pointer at the beginning of the function:
```c
static void f2fs_write_failed(struct address_space *mapping, loff_t to)
{
	struct inode *inode = mapping->host;

	if (!inode)  // Validate if `inode` is NULL.
		return;

	loff_t i_size = i_size_read(inode);

	/* In the fs-verity case, f2fs_end_enable_verity() does the truncate */
	if (to > i_size && !f2fs_verity_in_progress(inode)) {
		down_write(&F2FS_I(inode)->i_gc_rwsem[WRITE]);
		down_write(&F2FS_I(inode)->i_mmap_sem);

		truncate_pagecache(inode, i_size);
		if (!IS_NOQUOTA(inode))
			f2fs_truncate_blocks(inode, i_size, true);

		up_write(&F2FS_I(inode)->i_mmap_sem);
		up_write(&F2FS_I(inode)->i_gc_rwsem[WRITE]);
	}
}
```
This simple check will prevent the function from attempting to access `inode` if it is `NULL`.
