UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `ppsize` function takes `ppb` as its first argument, but the size of the buffer is fixed to 10 characters, and there is no guarantee that the buffer will not overflow if `size` contains a large value. Writing beyond the bounds of the buffer results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The buffer `ppb[10]` is used in the `ppsize` function call, but there is no verification or constraint ensuring that the formatted content written into `ppb` won't exceed its allocated size, especially when large values of `size` are passed to the function. Buffer overflow is possible, leading to memory corruption or crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the `ppsize` function respects the size of the buffer `ppb` (10 bytes) when formatting content. If necessary, use a secure alternative like `snprintf` with a specified buffer limit or validate the size variable beforehand.
