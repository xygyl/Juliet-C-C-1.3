### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not verify if `new_stream` is NULL before dereferencing it via `&new_stream->vsc_infopacket` in the call to `memcmp`. Dereferencing a NULL pointer is undefined behavior as per the C standard.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `new_stream` is NULL, the function will dereference it in the call to `memcmp`, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference. This is a memory-related issue and can cause program crashes or unintended behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Add a check to ensure `new_stream` is not NULL before dereferencing it. Modify the function as follows:  

```c
static bool is_vsc_info_packet_changed(struct dc_stream_state *cur_stream,
		struct dc_stream_state *new_stream)
{
	if (cur_stream == NULL || new_stream == NULL)
		return true;

	if (memcmp(&cur_stream->vsc_infopacket,
			&new_stream->vsc_infopacket,
			sizeof(struct dc_info_packet)) != 0)
		return true;

	return false;
}
```  

This ensures both `cur_stream` and `new_stream` are valid pointers before using them.
