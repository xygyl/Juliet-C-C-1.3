UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The division `*tim2 / pacer->osc_base` and `*tim1 / pacer->osc_base` may cause undefined behavior if `pacer->osc_base` is zero. Division by zero in C is undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: If `pacer->osc_base` is zero, the calculation of `*div1` and `*div2` would lead to incorrect behavior. Furthermore, later calculations depend on these incorrect values, causing the function's logic to fail.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `pacer->osc_base` is greater than zero before performing any divisions involving this variable. If `pacer->osc_base` is expected to always be non-zero, document this assumption explicitly to avoid misconfiguration.

Example Fix:
```c
if (pacer->osc_base == 0) {
    // Handle error condition appropriately, e.g., set div1/div2 to 0 or return an error.
    return;
}
*div1 = *tim2 / pacer->osc_base;  
*div2 = *tim1 / pacer->osc_base;  
```
