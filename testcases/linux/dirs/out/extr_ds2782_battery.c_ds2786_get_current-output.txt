Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_ds2782_battery.c_ds2786_get_current.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Division by zero may occur when `info->rsns` is zero. The expression `DS2786_CURRENT_UNITS / info->rsns` is undefined behavior if `info->rsns` equals zero, as division by zero is not defined in the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic or Runtime Error: Division by Zero
Bug Reason: If `info->rsns` can be zeroâ€”either due to improper initialization or a fault in program logicâ€”it will cause undefined behavior (division by zero) and could result in a crash or unpredictable behavior in runtime. This is a logic flaw.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check before the division operation to validate `info->rsns` is not zero:
```c
if (info->rsns == 0) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return an appropriate error code for invalid input
}
*current_uA = (raw / 16) * (DS2786_CURRENT_UNITS / info->rsns);
```
