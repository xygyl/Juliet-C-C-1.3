Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dm-stats.c___check_shared_memory.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential signed integer overflow when performing the addition `shared_memory_amount + alloc_size`. If `shared_memory_amount` and `alloc_size` are such that their sum exceeds the maximum value of `size_t` (platform-dependent), the behavior is undefined in the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: If the addition `shared_memory_amount + alloc_size` results in an overflow, the subsequent program logic, including boundary checks like `a < shared_memory_amount` and `a >> PAGE_SHIFT > totalram_pages() / DM_STATS_MEMORY_FACTOR`, becomes invalid since `a` would wrap around to an unexpected value.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a guard check before performing the addition to ensure no wraparound occurs:
```c
if (alloc_size > SIZE_MAX - shared_memory_amount)
    return false;
```
