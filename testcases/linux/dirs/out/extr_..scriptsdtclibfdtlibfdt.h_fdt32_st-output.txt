UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function assumes that the `property` pointer is valid and points to at least 4 writable bytes. If `property` is NULL or invalid, dereferencing it (`bp[0]`, `bp[1]`, etc.) leads to undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If `property` is passed as NULL or an invalid address, this would result in an attempt to dereference it (e.g., `bp[0]`), causing a crash or corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for NULL:
```c
if (!property) {
    return; // or handle appropriately
}
```
Also, the function should ensure the caller guarantees `property` points to an allocated memory region of at least 4 bytes.
