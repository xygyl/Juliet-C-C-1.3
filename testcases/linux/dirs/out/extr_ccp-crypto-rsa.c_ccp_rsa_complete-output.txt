Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_ccp-crypto-rsa.c_ccp_rsa_complete.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior due to using bitwise right shift (`>>`) on signed integer `rctx->cmd.u.rsa.key_size`, which might be negative. The C standard does not define the behavior for right-shifting negative values unless the shifted integer is unsigned.  
Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: N/A  
Bug Reason: No apparent logic or memory-related bugs in the code, as long as the undefined behavior does not manifest. The function performs its intended operation correctly, assuming valid inputs.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `rctx->cmd.u.rsa.key_size` is guaranteed to be non-negative or explicitly cast it to an unsigned type (e.g., `(unsigned int)`) before the right shift operation.
