Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_smsdvb-debugfs.c_smsdvb_print_isdb_stats_ex.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential buffer overflow caused by excessive calls to `snprintf` where `PAGE_SIZE - n` could go negative. The function does not enforce bounds checks on `n` before writing to `buf`, which may lead to writing outside the bounds of `debug_data->stats_data`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The `snprintf` calls depend on the assumption that `PAGE_SIZE - n` remains positive. If the total size of the data being written exceeds `PAGE_SIZE`, this could overwrite memory beyond the allocated size of `debug_data->stats_data`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit bounds checking to ensure `n` does not exceed `PAGE_SIZE` during data aggregation. For example, check if `(PAGE_SIZE - n) < 0` before each `snprintf` call and appropriately terminate further writing to the buffer. Additionally, document the assumption about buffer size and ensure the caller provides a sufficiently sized buffer.
