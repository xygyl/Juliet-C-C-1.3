Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_xdp_monitor_user.c_alloc_stats_record.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Using `malloc()` without checking its return value before performing a `memset()`**: If `malloc()` fails, it can return `NULL`, and calling `memset(rec, 0, sizeof(*rec))` with `rec` as `NULL` results in undefined behavior.  
2. **Calling `exit(EXIT_FAIL_MEM)` after dereferencing a possibly `NULL` pointer (`rec`)**: If memory allocation fails, writing to an invalid pointer in subsequent lines (`rec->xdp_redirect[i].cpu`) is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory allocation failure handling issue  
Bug Reason: Memory allocation (`malloc()`) is performed without verifying if it succeeded. This can result in accessing `NULL` or invalid memory, leading to memory corruption or crashes.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Check the return value of `malloc()` before proceeding further. If `NULL` is returned, immediately print an error message and exit the function:  

```c
rec = malloc(sizeof(*rec));
if (!rec) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation error\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAIL_MEM);
}
memset(rec, 0, sizeof(*rec));
```

2. Ensure subsequent calls to `alloc_rec_per_cpu()` are similarly guarded against failures (if that function also allocates memory). Check return values in every case before dereferencing the pointers.
