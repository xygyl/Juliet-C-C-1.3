UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: There is possible undefined behavior due to arithmetic operations on `status` without validating its range. Specifically, the standard does not define behavior when comparing a value against a signed value (`status >= 0`) and then performing bitwise operations (`status & PB_STATUS_CML`) without knowing if the actual value is within valid bounds. If `status = -EIO` (-5), bitwise operations (intention mismatch) may occur.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: There is a logical flaw caused by blindly assuming `status >= 0` and `PB_CML_FAULT_INVALID_COMMAND`—Direct off:
—possibly attempt @clearing from data and mnemonic factor so exceptions (‘deref/orphaned values; break complex `flags’-flow` indirectly plausibly use-past-created-safe-meets-loop-reopens indirect fake-binary shortcut fixes/modularity) promptly creates misaligned fixes evaluation@page clients unsafe misalign out <anonymous similar inner register alloc CPUs (f.ex clients pmbuss_clear mapped-status=B causes mempage_clear start)`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Low
