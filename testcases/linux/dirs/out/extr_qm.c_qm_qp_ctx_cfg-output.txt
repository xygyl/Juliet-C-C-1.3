Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_qm.c_qm_qp_ctx_cfg.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: `dma_map_single()` and `dma_unmap_single()` are used on `struct qm_sqc` and `struct qm_cqc`, but there is no guarantee that these structures are properly aligned for DMA operations. The C standard does not require structs to be naturally aligned, and misaligned access can cause undefined behavior on platforms requiring strict alignment for DMA mappings.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory leak
Bug Reason: If `dma_mapping_error()` returns true after a `kzalloc`, the function exits early without freeing the allocated `struct qm_sqc` or `struct qm_cqc`, resulting in a memory leak.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
1. Ensure `struct qm_sqc` and `struct qm_cqc` are properly aligned to the required boundary for DMA (e.g., using `__attribute__((aligned(x)))`).
2. Free `struct qm_sqc` and `struct qm_cqc` in case of `dma_mapping_error` before returning `ENOMEM`.
