UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The shift operation `(unsigned long long)nsecs >> 10` creates undefined behavior if `nsecs` is negative because right-shifting negative signed integers is undefined according to the C standard. Even though `nsecs` is cast to `unsigned long long`, the standard does not guarantee that shifting signed negative values behaves consistently across platforms.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: A potential logic bug arises because converting a negative signed `s64` value (`nsecs`) to `unsigned long long` can lead to an unexpected large positive number due to the reinterpretation of bits in the cast, which may result in incorrect debug output.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `nsecs` is non-negative before performing the right-shift operation to avoid undefined behavior and incorrect output. For example:
```c
if (nsecs < 0)
    nsecs = 0;  // or handle the negative value appropriately
dev_info(dev, "%pS returned %d after %Ld usecs\n", cb, error,
         (unsigned long long)nsecs >> 10);
```
