Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_auth.c_sctp_auth_asoc_set_default_hmac.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `id` variable, derived from `hmacs->hmac_ids[i]`, is used as an array index (`ep->auth_hmacs[id]`) without verification that `id` is strictly less than the array size. If `id` equals `SCTP_AUTH_HMAC_ID_MAX`, this results in an out-of-bounds access, violating C's rules and invoking undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Array Out-of-Bounds Access
Bug Reason: The code only ensures `id` is less than or equal to `SCTP_AUTH_HMAC_ID_MAX`, but does not check that `id` is strictly less than the size of `ep->auth_hmacs`, leading to a possible out-of-bounds access.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Modify the range check for `id` such that `id < SCTP_AUTH_HMAC_ID_MAX` instead of `id > SCTP_AUTH_HMAC_ID_MAX`. Alternatively, define the size of `ep->auth_hmacs` explicitly and check whether `id < sizeof(ep->auth_hmacs)/sizeof(ep->auth_hmacs[0])` before accessing the array.
