Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_amd_powerplay.c_pp_dpm_get_current_power_state.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function utilizes the `return -EINVAL` construct in a function whose return type is an `enum amd_pm_state_type`. The `-EINVAL` integer value does not belong to the enumerated type and may lead to undefined behavior depending on the compiler or architecture, as the C standard does not guarantee type compatibility for such cases.  

Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: N/A  
Bug Reason: There are no apparent logic or memory-related bugs in the function. Mutex handling is appropriate, input validation (`hwmgr`, `pm_en`, and `current_ps` checks) is present, and the logic for determining the `pm_type` based on state classification seems correct.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `return -EINVAL` with another mechanism to signal an error condition, such as returning a specific enumerator value dedicated to errors (e.g., a new value `POWER_STATE_TYPE_ERROR` in the enumeration) or using an output parameter for errors while returning a valid `enum amd_pm_state_type` value from the function.
