UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses `usleep_range()` with variable arguments (`25, 100`) in a synchronization context. However, coupling synchronization of hardware interaction with timing functions without verifying hardware readiness might introduce platform-specific undefined behavior, as hardware may not behave deterministically with such sleep timing.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: There is potential for hardware race conditions. Specifically, the function resets the FIFO twice (lines containing `PCI230_ADC_FIFO_RESET`) with the assumption that this guarantees hardware stability. Without explicitly verifying hardware readiness after the first reset, subsequent operations might behave unpredictably, leading to unstable data acquisition.

Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Introduce a hardware status verification mechanism after the first FIFO reset to ensure readiness before proceeding with the second reset and other operations. Additionally, confirm hardware states after timing-based delays for robustness.
