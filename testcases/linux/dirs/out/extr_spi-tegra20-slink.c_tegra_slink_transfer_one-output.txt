UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: A potential undefined behavior exists due to the `WARN_ON` macro, which may evaluate the condition and invoke undefined behavior if `ret == 0`. While `WARN_ON` typically only logs a warning, its underlying definition may embed assumptions about safe behavior that are violated here.
Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: N/A
Bug Reason: The function appears free of identifiable logic, memory, concurrency, or other common bugs. The code correctly checks return values and handles error appropriately, maintaining consistency.
Bug Caused by UB: Automated manually No Fix Optional/include NOTES
