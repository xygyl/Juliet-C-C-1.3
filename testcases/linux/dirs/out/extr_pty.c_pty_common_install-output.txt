Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pty.c_pty_common_install.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: In the `!legacy` branch, the second `memset` call mistakenly uses `sizeof(tty->termios_locked)` for `o_tty->termios_locked`. This results in accessing memory improperly, which causes undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory corruption  
Bug Reason: The incorrect `memset` size can overwrite adjacent memory regions of `o_tty`, leading to memory corruption. The bug is caused by the UB in the `memset` size calculation.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `sizeof(tty->termios_locked)` with `sizeof(o_tty->termios_locked)` in the second `memset` call. It should match the correct size of the `o_tty->termios_locked` field to prevent memory corruption.
