Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_builtin-c2c.c_print_c2c__display_stats.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Division by zero is possible when `llc_misses == 0`. This occurs during calculations for percentages (`llc_misses` is used as the denominator in several divisions), which is undefined behavior in C.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: Division by zero leads to invalid percentage calculations and may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. This bug stems directly from the UB of dividing by zero and occurs when `llc_misses` equals zero due to no LLC misses.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for `llc_misses == 0` prior to the percentage calculations and skip these calculations or display a meaningful message indicating no LLC misses occurred. For example:  
```c
if (llc_misses == 0) {
    fprintf(out, "  LLC Misses to Local DRAM          : N/A (no LLC misses)\n");
    fprintf(out, "  LLC Misses to Remote DRAM         : N/A (no LLC misses)\n");
    fprintf(out, "  LLC Misses to Remote cache (HIT)  : N/A (no LLC misses)\n");
    fprintf(out, "  LLC Misses to Remote cache (HITM) : N/A (no LLC misses)\n");
} else {
    fprintf(out, "  LLC Misses to Local DRAM          : %10.1f%%\n", ((double)stats->lcl_dram/(double)llc_misses) * 100.);
    fprintf(out, "  LLC Misses to Remote DRAM         : %10.1f%%\n", ((double)stats->rmt_dram/(double)llc_misses) * 100.);
    fprintf(out, "  LLC Misses to Remote cache (HIT)  : %10.1f%%\n", ((double)stats->rmt_hit /(double)llc_misses) * 100.);
    fprintf(out, "  LLC Misses to Remote cache (HITM) : %10.1f%%\n", ((double)stats->rmt_hitm/(double)llc_misses) * 100.);
}
```
