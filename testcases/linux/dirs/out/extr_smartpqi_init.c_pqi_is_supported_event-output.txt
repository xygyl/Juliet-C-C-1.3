Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_smartpqi_init.c_pqi_is_supported_event.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `pqi_event_type_to_event_index` is called but its implementation is not provided. If this function accesses uninitialized or invalid data, performs signed integer overflow, or has undefined return values leading to comparison with `-1`, the behavior can be undefined.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: Returning the result of `pqi_event_type_to_event_index(event_type) != -1` assumes that `pqi_event_type_to_event_index` consistently returns `-1` for unsupported events. If `pqi_event_type_to_event_index` has bugs or unintended behavior (such as returning values other than indices or `-1`), this comparison may result in incorrect logic, potentially leading to false positives/negatives in determining supported event types.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure the implementation of `pqi_event_type_to_event_index` consistently follows documented behavior, reliably returning `-1` for unsupported event types. Validate the return values to avoid unexpected outcomes or use explicit error checks.
