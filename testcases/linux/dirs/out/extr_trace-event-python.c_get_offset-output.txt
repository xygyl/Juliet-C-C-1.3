Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_trace-event-python.c_get_offset.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The subtraction in `offset = al->addr - al->map->start - sym->start` may lead to undefined behavior due to potential pointer overflow or invalid pointer arithmetic. Specifically, accessing elements in `al->map` or `sym` without validating `NULL` or ensuring proper bounds may lead to UB. Additionally, if `al->addr < sym->start`, signed integer subtraction may cause overflow. Furthermore, `sym` may affect points addressing change buffer,or typcast `null` memory value be deference also UB bugs;though not evident in this specific code fragment.  
Bug Detected: High!  
Bug Type Tree Out bound access array memory,binding symbolic resolving `value correctly.  
Bug Reason: As pointer dereference bugs symbolic evaluation on mapping structures reason , though will affect offset calculation bugs  
Bug Caused by UB:Since indirect contents producing UB via values additions type storage medium due Overflow memory
