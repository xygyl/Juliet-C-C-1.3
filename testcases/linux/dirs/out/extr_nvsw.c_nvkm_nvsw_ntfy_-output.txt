### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `nvkm_nvsw_ntfy_()` may dereference a null pointer. Specifically, the line `*pevent = &nvsw->chan->event;` assumes `nvsw` is not null, but `nvkm_nvsw()` might return null (there's no validation of its return value before accessing `nvsw->chan`). Dereferencing a null pointer is undefined behavior. Additionally, accessing `chan` could cause undefined behavior if `nvsw->chan` is itself null.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `nvkm_nvsw(object)` returns null or `nvsw->chan` is null, the dereferencing of `nvsw->chan->event` would trigger a null pointer dereference. This is a critical bug that could cause crashes or undefined behavior in runtime.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

---

### Fix Suggestion:
Add necessary null checks for both `nvsw` and `nvsw->chan`. For example:  
```c
struct nvkm_nvsw *nvsw = nvkm_nvsw(object);
if (!nvsw || !nvsw->chan) {
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
This ensures that the function handles null pointers gracefully and avoids undefined behavior or crashes.
