UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `sizeof(node)` buffer size in `snprintf` may lead to a buffer overrun when writing more characters than it can hold, as it's only 3 bytes, and `snprintf` can write a null terminator (`'\0`) resulting in a total of 4 bytes (e.g., writing "123"). This is undefined behavior when the buffer size is exceeded.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The buffer `node`, with a size of 3, is used as the destination for `snprintf`, which could potentially result in buffer overflow if the numeric value exceeds 99 (requires more than 2 characters plus the null terminator). This occurs when `num_streams >= 100`, violating the size constraint for this buffer.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Increase the size of the `node` buffer to at least `4` (or larger, e.g., `12`), ensuring it can sufficiently handle numerical values up to `VSND_MAX_STREAM` safely.

Explanation:
- **UB Detected**: When `num_streams` exceeds two digits (e.g., `100`), the call to `snprintf` will write beyond the bounds of the `node` buffer due to its insufficient size of 3 bytes. This results in undefined behavior since `snprintf` ensures a null terminator, which adds an additional byte.
- **Bug Detected**: A logic error stemming from the inadequate buffer size for `node` leads to the overflow problem when handling larger values of `num_streams`. This could result in memory corruption or unintended side effects during execution.
- **Confidence**: Analysis is straightforward and unequivocal, as the issue is a clear mismatch between buffer size and potential output size of `snprintf`. Thus, the confidence level is high.

The rest of the function appears correct, but this critical flaw must be addressed to ensure proper behavior and memory safety.
