### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing uninitialized elements in the `cores` and `ratio` arrays is undefined behavior. The arrays `cores` and `ratio` are declared with size `buckets_no`, but their elements beyond the first are not explicitly initialized. Accessing such uninitialized memory in the loop where `cores[b_nr + 1]` and `ratio[b_nr + 1]` are computed can lead to undefined behavior. The initialization of elements depends entirely on the logic in the loop, and `b_nr` may exceed the number of initialized elements.  
Additionally, signed integer arithmetic (e.g., `ratio[b_nr] - delta_ratio`) could overflow, which is undefined behavior in C.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw / Undefined Behavior Interaction  
Bug Reason: Propagation of undefined values from uninitialized array elements (`cores[b_nr + 1]` and `ratio[b_nr + 1]`) can cause incorrect computation of turbo ratio limits. This results in possibly invalid data being printed in the output.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Initialize the `cores` and `ratio` arrays entirely to zero before processing. Additionally, verify that signed integer arithmetic does not cause overflow under extreme input scenarios. For example:
```c
unsigned int cores[buckets_no] = {0};
unsigned int ratio[buckets_no] = {0};
```
Alternatively, ensure `delta_cores` and `delta_ratio` are within bounds to prevent overflow during arithmetic operations.
