### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: 
1. **Signed vs Unsigned Integer Mix**: The `j44` function is called with parameters `a` and `b`, whose types are deduced at runtime and could cause mixing of signed and unsigned integers without a guarantee that they fit the expected result type. Depending on these values, the behavior may cause undefined behavior as per the C standard due to type conversions.
2. **Pointer Misalignment Risk**: Although there's no explicit "dereference" misuse, the macros `cont_map[]` or `regr` extract backward lifetime checks and are poorly memory-checked APIs.
Bug Detected:
