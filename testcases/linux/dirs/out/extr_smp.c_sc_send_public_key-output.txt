UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The infinite `while (true)` loop is problematic because it doesn't guarantee termination. Although the loop checks `crypto_memneq(smp->local_pk, debug_pk, 64)` to eventually break out, there is no assurance that this condition will ever be met in all scenarios (e.g., if `generate_ecdh_keys` produces a debug key continuously due to faulty implementation or unspecified randomness). This violates the C standard by risking unbounded execution time, especially in non-deterministic environments.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The `while (true)` loop could theoretically result in an infinite loop if `generate_ecdh_keys` repeatedly generates keys identical to `debug_pk`. Introducing a maximum retry count would ensure termination and avoid unbounded behavior. Additionally, no explicit error handling is present for repeated failures within the loop. This can lead to a deadlock or resource starvation in real-world use.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add a retry limit to the `while (true)` loop to guarantee termination in case of repeated failures. For example:
```c
int retry_count = 0;  
const int max_retries = 100;  
while (retry_count < max_retries) {
    if (generate_ecdh_keys(smp->tfm_ecdh, smp->local_pk))
        return SMP_UNSPECIFIED;
    if (crypto_memneq(smp->local_pk, debug_pk, 64))
        break;
    retry_count++;
}
if (retry_count == max_retries) 
    return SMP_UNSPECIFIED;  // Indicate failure after exhausting retries.
```
This ensures the loop does not run indefinitely and provides predictable behavior in failure scenarios.
