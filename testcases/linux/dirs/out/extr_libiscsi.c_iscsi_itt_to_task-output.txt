UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The expression `session->cmds[i]` can potentially cause an out-of-bounds array access if `i < 0`, as the logic does not validate that `i` is non-negative. Additionally, signed integer overflow can occur if `i` is computed improperly within `get_itt(itt)` or `parse_pdu_itt()`. Such overflow could lead to undefined behavior when `i` is used for indexing.
  
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic/Memory-related flaw
Bug Reason: There is a potential for an out-of-bounds array access in `session->cmds[i]` if the integer `i` is invalid, such as being negative, or if it exceeds the bounds (`session->cmds_max`). Although the `i >= session->cmds_max` check ensures the upper bound validity, no checks ensure `i >= 0`, leaving room for a logic flaw.
  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a validation check to ensure `i >= 0` before accessing `session->cmds[i]`. For example:
```c
if (i < 0 || i >= session->cmds_max)
    return NULL;
```
Also, ensure that `get_itt(itt)` or `parse_pdu_itt()` do not lead to signed integer overflow or invalid results.
