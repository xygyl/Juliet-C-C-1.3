Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_ampdu.c_brcms_c_ffpld_init.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses the construct `fifo->mcs2ampdu_table[i] = 255;` to initialize an array with indices ranging from `0` to `FFPLD_MAX_MCS`. However, the upper bound `FFPLD_MAX_MCS` + 1 is excluded, meaning this may cause out-of-bounds access if `FFPLD_MAX_MCS` is greater than or equal to the size of `mcs2ampdu_table`. Since the size of the array is not provided explicitly in the code, this is undefined behavior if the index exceeds the bounds.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Access
Bug Reason: Potential out-of-bounds write when indexing `fifo->mcs2ampdu_table[i]` due to the loop iterating up to and including `FFPLD_MAX_MCS` without confirming the array size.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Perform a bounds check on the size of `mcs2ampdu_table` before writing to it within the loop. Alternatively, ensure that the array is sized explicitly and sufficient to handle indices from `0` to `FFPLD_MAX_MCS`.

Example fix:
```c
for (i = 0; i <= FFPLD_MAX_MCS && i < ARRAY_SIZE(fifo->mcs2ampdu_table); i++)
    fifo->mcs2ampdu_table[i] = 255;
```
