Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_tusb6010.c_tusb_probe.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `memset` operation might cause undefined behavior because the size calculation for the memory to be initialized (`sizeof(*musb_resources) * ARRAY_SIZE(musb_resources)`) assumes all elements of `musb_resources` are being initialized. However, the expression `sizeof(*musb_resources)` will return the size of a single `struct resource` object. If the size of `musb_resources` array is less than `ARRAY_SIZE(musb_resources)` due to external constraints, the memory beyond the end of the array may be written to, causing out-of-bounds memory access and undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The `memset` function operates on `musb_resources` across the calculated range `sizeof(*musb_resources) * ARRAY_SIZE(musb_resources)`. If `ARRAY_SIZE(musb_resources)` exceeds the actual number of initialized elements in `musb_resources`, this results in a buffer overflow.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Replace the `memset` operation with either `sizeof(musb_resources)` or explicitly specify the correct range for `ARRAY_SIZE(musb_resources)` if additional constraints apply.
