UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function contains straightforward pointer and integer operations to print a hex dump of a memory region. There is no evidence of undefined behavior as long as the parameters `addr` and `len` are valid when called.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The pointer `addr` is directly passed to `print_hex_dump`. If `addr` is `NULL`, the `print_hex_dump` function may attempt to dereference the null pointer, depending on its implementation, leading to a crash or unintended behavior. The function does not check the validity of `addr`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for the `addr` parameter before calling `print_hex_dump`. For example:  
```c
if (addr == NULL) {
    return;
}
```  
This ensures that the function does not proceed with a potentially null pointer, preventing null dereference issues.
