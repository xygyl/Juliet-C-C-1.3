UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function subtracts 110 (`- 110`) from the return values of `GET_PHY_STAT_P1_PWDB_A` and `GET_PHY_STAT_P1_PWDB_B`, which are presumably unsigned integers (`u8`). This subtraction can lead to unsigned integer underflow if the return value is less than 110, resulting in values wrapping around and producing unexpected large values.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The logic relies on signed processing of values computed as `pkt_stat->rx_power[RF_PATH_A]` and `pkt_stat->rx_power[RF_PATH_B]` after subtracting 110 from potentially unsigned inputs. If unsigned integer wrapping occurs, the subsequent calculations involving `rtw_phy_rf_power_2_rssi` and `max3` would produce incorrect results, causing inaccuracies in determining RSSI and signal power which are likely critical to the function's purpose.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
- Explicitly cast the result of `GET_PHY_STAT_P1_PWDB_A` and `GET_PHY_STAT_P1_PWDB_B` to `s8` or another signed integer type before performing the subtraction. For example:  
```c
pkt_stat->rx_power[RF_PATH_A] = (s8)GET_PHY_STAT_P1_PWDB_A(phy_status) - 110;  
pkt_stat->rx_power[RF_PATH_B] = (s8)GET_PHY_STAT_P1_PWDB_B(phy_status) - 110;
```  
This ensures proper handling of negative values and prevents unsigned underflow.
