### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `platform_get_drvdata()` function could return `NULL` if the `pdev` parameter is invalid or improperly set. The returned result, stored in `spc`, is dereferenced in `&spc->chip` without a null-pointer check, which results in undefined behavior if `spc` is `NULL`.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `spc` is `NULL` (due to `platform_get_drvdata()` returning `NULL`), then dereferencing it in `&spc->chip` will lead to a null pointer dereference, causing a runtime crash. This is a logic bug that occurs due to failure to validate the pointer before usage.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  
The analysis is confident because the dereference of `spc` without a prior null-pointer check directly violates safe pointer usage.  

### Fix Suggestion:  
Add a null-pointer check for `spc` before dereferencing it:  
```c
static int sprd_pwm_remove(struct platform_device *pdev)
{
    struct sprd_pwm_chip *spc = platform_get_drvdata(pdev);

    if (!spc)
        return -EINVAL;  // Handle the error case where spc is NULL

    return pwmchip_remove(&spc->chip);
}
```  
This fix ensures that the function fails gracefully if `spc` is `NULL` and avoids undefined behavior or potential runtime crashes.
