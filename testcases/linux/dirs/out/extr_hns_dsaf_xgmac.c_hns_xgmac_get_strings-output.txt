UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `g_xgmac_stats_string[i].desc` is accessed, but there is no guarantee that the `g_xgmac_stats_string` pointer is a valid or initialized memory reference when the function is called. Dereferencing an invalid pointer or uninitialized data would lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, if `g_xgmac_stats_string` is not defined or has insufficient elements, accessing it via `ARRAY_SIZE` could trigger out-of-bounds access, which is also undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential Null Pointer Dereference/Out-of-Bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: The code assumes the `g_xgmac_stats_string` pointer and its elements are valid and initialized without any checks. If `g_xgmac_stats_string` is null or the size of the array is incorrectly assumed, this would lead to memory access issues. Similarly, the use of `ARRAY_SIZE` assumes the array is globally defined without verification, risking out-of-bounds access.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
- Validate `g_xgmac_stats_string` at runtime to ensure it is not null before accessing its fields.
- Ensure proper initialization and validity checks for `g_xgmac_stats_string` and its size to avoid out-of-bounds memory access or use of uninitialized values.
- Example safety check:
```c
if (g_xgmac_stats_string == NULL) return;
```
- Add bounds checking to ensure `ARRAY_SIZE(g_xgmac_stats_string)` does not exceed actual available array size.
