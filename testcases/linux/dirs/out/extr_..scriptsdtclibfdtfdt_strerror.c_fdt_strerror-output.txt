Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_..scriptsdtclibfdtfdt_strerror.c_fdt_strerror.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code retrieves the `str` field of the `fdt_errtable` array using an index (`-errval`) that is not guaranteed to be within bounds. Specifically, there is no check to ensure that `-errval` falls within the valid range `[0, FDT_ERRTABSIZE - 1]`. Accessing an element outside the array bounds is undefined behavior in C.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: If `-errval` is less than `0` or greater than or equal to `FDT_ERRTABSIZE`, the code will attempt to access memory outside the bounds of the `fdt_errtable` array. This can lead to program crashes or corrupted memory access.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Modify the conditional `else if (errval > -FDT_ERRTABSIZE)` to include an additional check ensuring that `errval` will not index out of bounds: e.g.,
```c
else if (errval > -FDT_ERRTABSIZE && -errval < FDT_ERRTABSIZE) {
    const char *s = fdt_errtable[-errval].str;
    if (s)
        return s;
}
```
