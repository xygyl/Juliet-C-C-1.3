Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_..nfp_app.h_nfp_app_eswitch_mode_get.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Dereferencing a potentially NULL pointer (`app->type`) can result in undefined behavior if `app` or `app->type` is null. Similarly, the function pointer `app->type->eswitch_mode_get` can also be dereferenced without proper null-checking after confirming that `app->type` is non-null.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: There is no check to verify that `app` and `app->type` are non-null before accessing their members, which may lead to a null pointer dereference at runtime.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add null-checking for both `app` and `app->type` at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!app || !app->type || !app->type->eswitch_mode_get)
    return -EOPNOTSUPP;
```
