UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `WARN` macro appears to use `pgd_reg == -1` without ensuring the variable `pgd_reg` has been properly initialized. If `pgd_reg` is uninitialized, this comparison results in undefined behavior according to the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic/Initialization Bug  
Bug Reason: If `pgd_reg` is uninitialized, it could lead to incorrect behavior or crash during execution when the `WARN` macro evaluates `pgd_reg == -1`. Additionally, improper initialization might result in unexpected behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `pgd_reg` is properly initialized to a known value (e.g., `-1` or other valid values) before it is used in the conditional statement.
