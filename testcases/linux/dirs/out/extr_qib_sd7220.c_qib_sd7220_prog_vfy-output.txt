UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate the `img` pointer before dereferencing it. If `img` is `NULL`, this will result in undefined behavior through a null pointer dereference. Additionally, the use of signed arithmetic in the expression `sofar = -1;` could lead to UB if `sofar` were later used in contexts requiring non-negative values, though in this function the impact is limited.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `img` is passed as `NULL`, the function attempts to dereference it in the line `if (readback[idx] != img[idx+sofar])`, leading to a null pointer dereference bug. The code does not check the validity of the pointer `img`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `img` is a valid, non-NULL pointer:  
```c
if (!img) {
    return -1; // Or another error code indicating invalid input
}
```
