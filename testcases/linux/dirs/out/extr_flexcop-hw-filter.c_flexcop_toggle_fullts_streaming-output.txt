UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The behavior of the function when `fc` is `NULL` is undefined because it dereferences the `fc` pointer without checking if it is valid. If `fc` is `NULL`, accessing `fc->fullts_streaming_state` or passing `fc` to other function calls results in undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If the `fc` pointer passed to the function is `NULL`, the function immediately tries to dereference it (`fc->fullts_streaming_state`), causing a potential null pointer dereference. This would likely lead to a crash at runtime depending on the system.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `fc` at the beginning of the function. For example:  
```c
if (fc == NULL) {
    return -1; // or an appropriate error code
}
```
This ensures that the function gracefully handles cases where `fc` is `NULL`.
