UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences `cur` and `target` without verifying that they are non-NULL. If either pointer is NULL, dereferencing them would cause undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: Same as UB reason. Dereferencing a NULL pointer would lead to a runtime crash or potentially corrupt behavior depending on the system state.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null-pointer check for both `cur` and `target`. For example:
```c
if (cur == NULL || target == NULL) {
    return false;
}
```
