Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_ddbridge-max.c_max_set_voltage.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The bit-shifting operations used in `~(1ULL << input->nr)` and `(1ULL << input->nr)` assume that `input->nr` is within valid bounds (i.e., less than the number of bits in a `unsigned long long`). If `input->nr` is out of bounds (e.g., â‰¥ 64 on most platforms), the shift operation is undefined according to the C standard. Furthermore, no checks ensure that `input->nr` is within this range.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow/Underflow  
Bug Reason: If `input->nr` is outside the range of 0 to 63, the bit-shift will lead to undefined behavior, and any further logic in the function may result in incorrect device control or behavior due to unreliable state manipulation of `dev->link[port->lnr].lnb.voltages` and `dev->link[port->lnr].lnb.voltage[dvb->input]`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a range check for `input->nr` at the beginning of the function, ensuring it is between 0 and 63 inclusive for platforms with 64-bit integers. Example:  
```c
if (input->nr >= 64) {
    return -EINVAL; // Invalid parameter
}
```
Ensure similar checks are performed for all relevant variables before performing bit-shift operations.
