UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible dereference of a null pointer or invalid memory access. Specifically:
- `info->num_planes` assumes `info` is non-null, but the return value of `drm_get_format_info()` is not checked for null.
- Additionally, `cmd->pitches[0]` and `cmd->offsets[0]` are accessed without verifying if `cmd` is correctly initialized or valid, which could lead to undefined behavior if `cmd` is invalid or null.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference, Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: Missing checks for null return value of `drm_get_format_info()` and potential logic error when assuming all fields in `cmd` are valid without validation. This can lead to runtime crashes or unexpected behavior. If `info` is null, dereferencing `info->num_planes` causes undefined behavior. Similarly, arrays `cmd->pitches` and `cmd->offsets` are accessed directly without bounds checks or null validation.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add null checks for `info` after calling `drm_get_format_info()`. For example:
   ```c
   if (!info)
       return ERR_PTR(-EINVAL);
   ```
2. Validate `cmd->pitches[0]` and `cmd->offsets[0]` to ensure array bounds are not violated or the input isn't malformed. Add checks to confirm `cmd` is properly initialized. For example:
   ```c
   if (!cmd->pitches || !cmd->offsets)
       return ERR_PTR(-EINVAL);
   ```
3. Introduce more robust validation for `cmd` and its members to ensure correctness before usage.
