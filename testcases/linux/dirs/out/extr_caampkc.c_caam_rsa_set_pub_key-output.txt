### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Uninitialized struct member `rsa_key->e_sz` and `rsa_key->n_sz` before use**: While the `rsa_key` structure is created and its members might get set within function calls, if the key parsing (`rsa_parse_pub_key`) or memory allocation (`kmemdup`, `caam_read_raw_data`) fails, the code may access uninitialized members later in cleanup routines like `caam_rsa_free_key()`. Accessing uninitialized structure members is undefined behavior.  
2. **Potential null pointer dereference**: If `kmemdup` or `caam_read_raw_data` returns `NULL`, but the cleanup path (`caam_rsa_free_key` or other calls) relies on accessing the pointers like `rsa_key->e`, `rsa_key->n` without confirming their validity, it would lead to undefined behavior.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory management bug  
Bug Reason:  
1. **Memory allocation failure not fully handled**: If `kmemdup` or `caam_read_raw_data` fails, the function returns `-ENOMEM` after calling `caam_rsa_free_key`. However, this could lead to memory leaks or improper access to invalid/uninitialized members of `rsa_key`, depending on what `caam_rsa_free_key` does.
2. **Potential leak on partial allocation failure**: If `kmemdup` succeeds but `caam_read_raw_data` fails, the already allocated `rsa_key->e` memory is not released manually prior to the cleanup, leading to a memory leak.
3. **Logic flaw in handling key length checks**: If `caam_rsa_check_key_length` returns an error (`true`), the function calls `caam_rsa_free_key`. However, the error path assumes `rsa_key`'s members are guaranteed to be initialized, which might result in accessing invalid memory if an earlier memory allocation or operation failed.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Initialize all structure members (`rsa_key->e`, `rsa_key->n`, `rsa_key->e_sz`, and `rsa_key->n_sz`) explicitly to default values (`NULL` or `0`) during structure creation or before any operations. This ensures no uninitialized access occurs during error handling.
   ```c
   struct caam_rsa_key *rsa_key = &ctx->key;
   memset(rsa_key, 0, sizeof(*rsa_key));
   ```
2. Add explicit checks for `NULL` and proper cleanup for partially allocated memory before returning in error paths. For example:
   ```c
   if (rsa_key->e) {
       free(rsa_key->e);
       rsa_key->e = NULL;
   }
   ```
3. Ensure `caam_rsa_free_key` is designed to handle partially initialized keys safely without relying on all members being valid.
4. Validate assumptions about `rsa_parse_pub_key` and other function behaviors. For example, ensure they cannot write invalid or incomplete data into `raw_key`.
