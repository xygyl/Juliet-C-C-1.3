Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vega20_thermal.c_vega20_thermal_set_temperature_range.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible integer overflow when calculating `low` and `high` using `VEGA20_THERMAL_MINIMUM_ALERT_TEMP` and `PP_TEMPERATURE_UNITS_PER_CENTIGRADES`, depending on the multiplication result and type width assumptions. Signed integer overflow is undefined in C.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: If `VEGA20_THERMAL_MINIMUM_ALERT_TEMP` or `VEGA20_THERMAL_MAXIMUM_ALERT_TEMP` is unexpectedly large, the multiplication could result in an incorrect comparison or overflow, causing `low` to exceed `high` incorrectly or violate expected ranges.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `VEGA20_THERMAL_MINIMUM_ALERT_TEMP` and `VEGA20_THERMAL_MAXIMUM_ALERT_TEMP` are validated to avoid overflow in the multiplication operation. Use a safe type (e.g., unsigned long long or explicit boundary checks) for these calculations.
