Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_xilinx-dma.c_xvip_pipeline_set_stream.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The decrement operation `--pipe->stream_count` may result in an integer underflow if `pipe->stream_count` is `0` before the decrement. Signed integer underflows are undefined behavior in C.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Underflow
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether `pipe->stream_count` is greater than `0` before decrementing it. This can lead to erroneous behavior or undefined behavior due to integer underflow, especially when the value is signed.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a condition to verify `pipe->stream_count > 0` before performing the decrement operation:
```c
if (pipe->stream_count > 0) {
    pipe->stream_count--;
    if (pipe->stream_count == 0)
        xvip_pipeline_start_stop(pipe, false);
} else {
    // Handle error appropriately or provide logging for unexpected values.
}
```
