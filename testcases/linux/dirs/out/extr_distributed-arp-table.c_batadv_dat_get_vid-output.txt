UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The pointer `hdr_size` is dereferenced without validation that it is not NULL. If `hdr_size` is NULL when passed into the function, accessing `*hdr_size` will cause undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `hdr_size` is a valid pointer but does not validate this assumption. If `hdr_size` is NULL, dereferencing it leads to undefined behavior and a runtime crash. Additionally, if `hdr_size` points to an invalid memory location, accessing `*hdr_size` can cause further undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `hdr_size` is not NULL before dereferencing it. For example:  
```c
if (!hdr_size) {
    // Handle error or return appropriate value
    return 0;
}
```
Alternatively, document the function's behavior and require callers to ensure `hdr_size` is valid before invoking the function.
