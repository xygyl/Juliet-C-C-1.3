UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is potential for accessing out-of-bounds array indices in the `pq_params` array if `num_tx_pqs` exceeds the length of the array passed to `p_params->pq_params`. This would cause undefined behavior due to invalid memory reads. Additionally, there is no verification of whether pointers like `p_params->pq_params` or `p_hwfn` are `NULL` before accessing them, which can lead to undefined behavior if these pointers are indeed `NULL`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The loop iterates over `num_tx_pqs`, but there is no sanity check to ensure the bounds of the `pq_params` array. If `num_tx_pqs > length(p_params->pq_params)`, it can cause a buffer overflow.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Validate the size of the `pq_params` array against `num_tx_pqs` before the loop to ensure it does not exceed its boundaries. For example:
   ```c
   if (num_tx_pqs > allocated_size_of_pq_params) {
       DP_NOTICE(p_hwfn, "Invalid num_tx_pqs causing potential overflow\n");
       return -1;
   }
   ```
2. Add a null check for `p_hwfn` and `p_params->pq_params`:
   ```c
   if (!p_hwfn || !p_params->pq_params) {
       DP_NOTICE(p_hwfn, "NULL pointer detected\n");
       return -1;
   }
   ```
