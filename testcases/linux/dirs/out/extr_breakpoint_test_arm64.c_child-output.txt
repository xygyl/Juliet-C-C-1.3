### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:
1. **Misaligned memory access**: In the function, depending on the value of the `size` parameter (e.g., when `size` is 16 or 32), the code writes to memory at the address `addr` using unchecked inline assembly or casts like `*(uint16_t *)addr`. This may trigger undefined behavior if the `addr` pointer isn't appropriately aligned for the required type size or instruction. The check `(uintptr_t)addr % size` doesn't prevent UB; it merely prints an error message but does nothing to correct alignment issues before execution.
2. **Strict aliasing violation**: Writing to `addr` using type punning (e.g., casting `addr` as `(uint16_t *)`, `(uint32_t *)`, or `(uint64_t *)`) violates strict aliasing rules in C unless appropriately aligned and correctly accessed.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Misaligned Memory Access  
Bug Reason: 
1. The pointer `addr` is calculated from `&var[32 + wr]`, but its alignment isn't explicitly guaranteed for data types like `uint1616_t`, `uint32_t`, or `uint64_t`. The size-specific writes, especially using inline assembly (`stp x29, x30` or `stp q29, q30`), require strict alignment to work correctly on arm64 architecture. Misaligned access can lead to segmentation faults or unintended results on hardware enforcing alignment requirements.
2. If the function is called with invalid `size` values, such as `3`, `5`, or values unsupported by the inline assembly, this switch statement will exhibit undefined behavior (writing to memory with undefined or random behavior in certain branches).

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. **Ensure correct pointer alignment**:
   - Before accessing memory at `addr`, verify the alignment explicitly using platform-specific functions or alignment guarantees.
   ```c
   if ((uintptr_t)addr % size != 0) {
       ksft_print_msg("Wrong address alignment for the given size: %s\n", strerror(errno));
       _exit(1);
   }
   ```
   Additionally, avoid unaligned writes.

2. **Validate `size` for allowed values**:
   - Add checks to ensure `size` is only 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32. Handle invalid values gracefully with an error path.

3. **Respect strict aliasing**:
   - Consider alternatives to direct type punning (e.g., use memcpy or inline assembly designed for unaligned memory if needed, and align addresses as required).

4. **Inline assembly safety**:
   - Ensure `addr` is properly aligned and validated for assembly instructions, as these may trigger hardware errors on arm64 if improperly used.
