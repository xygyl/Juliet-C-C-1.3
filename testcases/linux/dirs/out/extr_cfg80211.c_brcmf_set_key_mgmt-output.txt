UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code accesses structures (`rsn_ie->len`) based on parsed TLV data but does insufficient validation of IE length boundaries (`ie_len`). Specifically, the checks at several points such as `offset + WPA_IE_SUITE_COUNT_LEN >= ie_len` and subsequent increments do not comprehensively guarantee `offset + ... <= ie_len` scenarios for all cases. This can lead to out-of-bounds memory access, causing undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Memory Access  
Bug Reason: TLV parsing and validations are insufficient in ensuring that memory accesses stay within bounds of the IE (`ie`). Reading or computing offsets without proper bounds check may lead to accessing invalid memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Strengthen the boundary checks for the TLV parsing. For example, ensure that every computed offset and its subsequent access fully fall within the bounds of `ie_len`. Replace current checks like `offset + ... >= ie_len` with the more appropriate `offset + ... <= ie_len`.
