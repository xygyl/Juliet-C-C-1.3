Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_atusb.c_atusb_get_and_show_build.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The return value `ret` from `atusb_control_msg` can exceed the allocated size `ATUSB_BUILD_SIZE` when the USB device sends more data. Writing `build[ret] = 0` in such a case will result in a buffer overflow, which is undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer overflow
Bug Reason: If `ret` exceeds `ATUSB_BUILD_SIZE`, the write to `build[ret]` will corrupt adjacent memory. Additionally, there is no check to ensure `ret` is within the bounds `[0, ATUSB_BUILD_SIZE]`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check before `build[ret] = 0` to ensure `ret` does not exceed the allocated size `ATUSB_BUILD_SIZE`.
For example:
```c
if (ret >= 0 && ret < ATUSB_BUILD_SIZE) {
    build[ret] = 0;
    dev_info(&usb_dev->dev, "Firmware: build %s\n", build);
} else if (ret >= ATUSB_BUILD_SIZE) {
    dev_info(&usb_dev->dev, "Warning: Received data exceeds buffer size\n");
}
```
