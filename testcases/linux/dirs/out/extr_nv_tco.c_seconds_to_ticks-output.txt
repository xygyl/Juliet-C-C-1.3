Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nv_tco.c_seconds_to_ticks.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow may occur when calculating `(seconds * 10)`. Multiplying `seconds` by `10` can exceed the range of `int` if `seconds` has a high value close to `INT_MAX/10`. Signed integer overflow in C causes undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: N/A  
Bug Reason: The logic of the function appears correct for inputs that do not cause undefined behavior. The formula used to convert seconds to ticks aligns with the expected 0.6-second decrement interval.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Use a wider data type such as `long long` or `unsigned long` for the intermediate result before division to safely handle larger values of `seconds`. For example:  
```c  
return (unsigned char)((long long)seconds * 10 / 6);  
```  
This ensures the multiplication remains safe, avoiding signed integer overflow.
