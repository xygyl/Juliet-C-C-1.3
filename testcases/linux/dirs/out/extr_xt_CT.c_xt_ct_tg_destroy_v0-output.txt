UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `info_v1.helper` is being used in a `memcpy` operation, but there is no guarantee that `info_v1.helper` has been properly initialized or allocated with sufficient size. If `info_v1.helper` is not valid or its size does not match `sizeof(info->helper)`, this results in undefined behavior due to invalid memory access.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Possible Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The `memcpy` operation assumes that `info_v1.helper` has the same size and memory layout as `info->helper`. If `info_v1.helper` was not allocated properly or does not match the size of `info->helper`, this can result in a buffer overflow or corruption of neighboring memory.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `info_v1.helper` is properly initialized or allocated to match the size of `info->helper` before using it in the `memcpy` operation. For example:

```c
memset(&info_v1, 0, sizeof(info_v1)); // Initialize entire structure to zero
memcpy(info_v1.helper, info->helper, sizeof(info->helper));
```

Alternatively, explicitly verify the size and memory validity of `info->helper` and `info_v1.helper` prior to the copy.
