UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Dereferencing `total_bytes` without ensuring it is not `NULL`. In the case that `total_bytes` is passed as `NULL`, the line `(*total_bytes) += len;` results in undefined behavior due to attempted access to a null pointer.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `total_bytes` is passed as `NULL`, dereferencing and updating it leads to undefined behavior and potentially crashes. This lack of null pointer checking introduces a serious bug.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `total_bytes` at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (total_bytes == NULL) {
    return; // or handle error appropriately
}
```
Alternatively, document and enforce the assumption that `total_bytes` must never be `NULL` when calling this function.
