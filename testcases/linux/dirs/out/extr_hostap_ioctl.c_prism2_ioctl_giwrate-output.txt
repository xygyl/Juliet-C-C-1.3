UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code does not guarantee proper alignment for dereferencing the `val` variable via the `get_rid` function. If `get_rid` attempts to copy data into `val` while interpreting it as part of a broader data structure, and alignment requirements are violated, undefined behavior could happen. Additionally, `local->ap->last_tx_rate` could lead to UB if `local->ap` is `NULL` (although this is checked earlier, misuse elsewhere might circumvent the validation).  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The logic relies on a default value (`rrq->value = 11000000`) in the `default` case of the `switch` statement, even if the retrieved `val` is invalid or unrecognized. This could mislead the user into thinking the rate was successfully retrieved. Furthermore, the return value (`ret = -EINVAL`) suggests an error, but the function inconsistently sets `rrq->value` regardless, causing possible user confusion.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before further operations dependent on `val`, ensure `get_rid` properly validates alignment or memory access correctness. Remove the unconditional assignment of `11000000` in the `default` case to avoid user confusion. Instead, leave `rrq->value` unset or set it to a recognizable error value (e.g., `-1`). Ensure any future misuse of the checked `local->ap` pointer is guarded by adequate validations.
