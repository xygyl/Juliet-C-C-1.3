UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences `pipe_ctx->plane_state` and `pipe_ctx->stream` without ensuring they are not NULL. If either of these pointers is NULL, attempting to access their members will result in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The lack of verification for `pipe_ctx->plane_state` and `pipe_ctx->stream` could lead to runtime null pointer dereference, potentially crashing the program.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit checks to verify `pipe_ctx->plane_state` and `pipe_ctx->stream` are not NULL before using their members. For example:

```c
if (pipe_ctx->plane_state == NULL || pipe_ctx->stream == NULL)
    return false;
```
