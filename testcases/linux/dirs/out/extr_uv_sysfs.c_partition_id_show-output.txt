### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit any undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. Specifically:
- The `snprintf` function is used with appropriate arguments. The `buf` pointer is passed in as the destination buffer, `PAGE_SIZE` ensures size constraints are met for the buffer, and the format string `%ld` is appropriate for printing long integers.
- There is no dereferencing of null pointers, uninitialized variables, signed integer overflow, out-of-bounds memory access, or any operations violating strict aliasing.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The value of `sn_partition_id` is assumed to be valid, despite no verification of its initialization in this function or its range. If `sn_partition_id` is uninitialized or corrupt prior to calling this function, it could result in printing wrong or unintended values to `buf`. However, this is dependent on external context, and strictly speaking from the code snippet, this would be categorized as relying on external assumptions without local validation, which is a logic flaw.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  

### Confidence: Medium  

### Fix Suggestion:
Verify or initialize `sn_partition_id` to a meaningful and valid value within this function or ensure it is guaranteed valid by external context. If possible, add comments or assertions (`assert(sn_partition_id >= 0)`) to document preconditions. Alternatively, include a condition to verify the validity of `sn_partition_id` before using it for output formatting.
