Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sst-haswell-ipc.c_sst_hsw_module_disable.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential null-pointer dereference. The variable `module` can be NULL due to the return value of `sst_module_get_from_id()`. However, the code later accesses `module->state`, which could trigger undefined behavior if `module` is NULL.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not ensure that the pointer `module` is valid before accessing `module->state` after attempting to send the IPC message. This can lead to a null pointer dereference.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a defensive check after the call to `sst_module_get_from_id()` and before accessing `module->state`. For example, use:
```c
if (!module) {
    dev_err(dev, "module %d not valid\n", module_id);
    return -ENXIO;
}
```
Make sure the pointer is valid at all locations where it is dereferenced.
