UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function contains undefined behavior due to potential signed integer overflow when using `ret = -EIO;` where `EIO` is negative. The function later returns `ret`. While C allows signed integers to store negative values, signed integer overflow occurs if `ret` ever exceeds the boundaries of `signed int` during manipulation. While subtle clipped.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: # reattempt--- yes--- alignment-specific.  fix end of mentions-stuck boundary.  

Bug Caused by UB: #reason<describe neatly-field caused mentions-bad stack allocation pattern. context functions ignore UB.
