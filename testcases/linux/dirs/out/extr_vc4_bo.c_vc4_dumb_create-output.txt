UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential signed integer overflow when calculating `args->pitch * args->height` and assigning it to `args->size`. If either `args->pitch` or `args->height` are large enough, the multiplication can exceed the range of an `int` and result in undefined behavior due to signed integer overflow.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, integer overflow  
Bug Reason: The potential signed integer overflow in `args->size = args->pitch * args->height` can lead to incorrect allocation sizes, resulting in insufficient memory allocation (leading to buffer overflows or other runtime issues), or excessive allocation. Furthermore, even if allocation succeeds, using an incorrect size or pitch for the buffer can cause rendering or memory access issues in subsequent operations.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Use a larger unsigned integer type (e.g., `size_t`) for intermediate calculations to avoid overflow due to multiplication.  
2. Explicitly check for overflow by ensuring `args->pitch * args->height` does not exceed the maximum range of the target storage type:  
   ```c
   if (args->height > 0 && args->pitch > SIZE_MAX / args->height) {
       return -EINVAL; // Error: Overflow detected
   }
   args->size = args->pitch * args->height;
   ```  
This ensures that calculations are performed safely and guarantees correct behavior.
