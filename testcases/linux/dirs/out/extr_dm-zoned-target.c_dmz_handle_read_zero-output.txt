UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `swap` macro is intended to exchange two values. However, the second argument in the call to `swap(bio->bi_iter.bi_size, size)` is `size`, which is a local variable. The behavior of swapping a local variable with a member of `bio->bi_iter` results in temporary changes but will not persist as intended outside the scope due to swapping with a local variable. This violates the intent and could lead to unexpected behavior. Moreover, `swap` does not meet type safety requirements, particularly when the sizes of `bio->bi_iter.bi_size` and `size` are mismatched or if aliasing rules (non-strict aliasing) are violated.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The swapping operation and subsequent operations on `bio->bi_iter.bi_size` are fundamentally incorrect as the local `size` variable is swapped twice, which may lead to wrong results in the context of continuing the operation. This could also result in a logic error where the intended operations on `bi_size` fail to modify it consistently. There are redundant operations on `swap`, which further indicates bad logic design.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Replace swap operations with proper logical assignments or refactor the code to avoid redundant or unsafe swapping by using direct assignments that ensure type correctness and meet the intended behavior:

```c
bio->bi_iter.bi_size = nr_blocks << DMZ_BLOCK_SHIFT; // Assign directly
zero_fill_bio(bio); // Perform the zero-fill operation
bio_advance(bio, bio->bi_iter.bi_size); // Advance directly using the modified value
```
