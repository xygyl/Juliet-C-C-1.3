Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_file.c___ceph_copy_file_range.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: 
1. **Uninitialized Return Value in `__ceph_copy_file_range`**: The variable `ret` is initialized as `-EIO` but may be returned uninitialized if the condition `do_final_copy` is false and no error is encountered within the main loop. This constitutes undefined behavior as the exact value of `ret` is undefined in such cases.  
2. **Use of Unaligned Offset in Some Conditions**: In scenarios where `src_objoff != dst_objoff`, the function may compute unaligned sizes that could cause misaligned memory accesses contingent on subsequent operations.
3. **Strict Aliasing Violation or Mismatches**: The code could silently violate strict aliasing rules based on its reliance on pointer casting (`void*`, `scalar_t__`, and unions). Although not explicit here due to lack of visible dangerous casts, strict aliasing compliance is assumed unless proven to remain valid due structure via parent-storage).
