UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If the pointer `dst` is `NULL`, dereferencing it constitutes undefined behavior as it is neither checked nor guaranteed to be non-NULL before use.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not validate that the `dst` pointer is non-NULL, leading to potential dereferencing of a null pointer. This would cause a crash at runtime if `dst` is passed as `NULL`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `dst` is not null:
```c
if (!dst)
    return;
```
This ensures safe function behavior even if `dst` is NULL.
