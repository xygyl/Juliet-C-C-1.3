UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing array `data[i]` or `rc[i]` without verifying bounds against `num_mb` can lead to out-of-bounds access if `num_mb` exceeds their allocated sizes. The behavior of `data` and `rc` is undefined if initialized incorrectly or not appropriately sized. Additionally, implicit assumptions about valid pointer alignment or initialization for `data[i].req` and `data[i].wait` may lead to undefined behavior during cryptographic operations.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory and logic-related bugs  
Bug Reason: Out-of-bounds array access can occur for `data[i]` and `rc[i]` when `i >= num_mb` due to lack of bounds checking. If pointers in `data` are invalid or uninitialized, cryptographic calls (`crypto_skcipher_encrypt`, `crypto_skcipher_decrypt`, and `crypto_wait_req`) can lead to errors such as segmentation faults. In addition, if error codes in `rc[i]` are not properly handled, it can cause inconsistent behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Verify that both `data` and `rc` arrays have a size >= `num_mb` before accessing their elements.  
2. Initialize or validate `data[i].req` and `data[i].wait` to ensure they point to valid memory regions or structures.  
3. Check bounds and ensure proper handling of error codes returned by cryptographic function calls. Add explicit null or invalid pointer checks wherever necessary.  
4. Implement comprehensive logging and error handling to address failures in cryptographic operations.
