Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_..schedsched.h___dl_add.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer type `s32` is explicitly cast from `tsk_bw (u64)` during division. If `tsk_bw / cpus` results in a value that exceeds the range of `s32`, this causes implementation-defined behavior or undefined behavior. Additionally, integer division of `u64` by `int (cpus)` could lead to truncation errors due to the cast.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer overflow or truncation issue
Bug Reason: The division operation `tsk_bw / cpus` and subsequent casting to `(s32)` may lead to incorrect results in systems where `tsk_bw` exceeds the range of a 32-bit signed integer. This would cause loss of precision or incorrect application behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Replace `(s32)` with a larger signed type such as `int64_t` or avoid casting if the operation logic does not explicitly require truncation. Additionally, ensure `cpus` is validated to avoid division by zero.
