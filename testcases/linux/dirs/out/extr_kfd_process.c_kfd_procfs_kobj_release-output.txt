Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_kfd_process.c_kfd_procfs_kobj_release.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `kfd_procfs_kobj_release()` calls `kfree()` on the argument `kobj`. If `kobj` is NULL (which is permissible for a `struct kobject*`), `kfree()` may attempt to dereference a null pointer, resulting in undefined behavior according to the C standard. The standard does not guarantee that passing `NULL` to `kfree()` behaves safely unless explicitly defined by the implementation being used.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If the caller passes a NULL pointer to `kfd_procfs_kobj_release()`, the `kfree()` function invocation will likely attempt to dereference NULL, causing a runtime error like a segmentation fault.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before calling `kfree(kobj)`, check if `kobj` is NULL. For example:
```c
if (kobj != NULL)
    kfree(kobj);
```
