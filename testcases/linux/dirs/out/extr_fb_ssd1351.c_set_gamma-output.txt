Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fb_ssd1351.c_set_gamma.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `tmp` array, which is declared to have a size of `GAMMA_NUM * GAMMA_LEN`, is indexed up to 63 without checking whether the size of the array is sufficient to avoid out-of-bounds access. If `GAMMA_NUM * GAMMA_LEN` is less than 63, this results in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds access. The behavior is unspecified and dependent on the platform.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Array Out-of-Bounds Index
Bug Reason: The `tmp` array may not have sufficient size as per the loop iteration (from 0 to 62 inclusive). Writing to `tmp` beyond its allocated size can corrupt memory or lead to unpredictable runtime behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Verify that `GAMMA_NUM * GAMMA_LEN >= 63`, and if not, ensure the `tmp` array is resized appropriately to handle the loop. Alternatively, add runtime checks to ensure indexing stays within bounds.
