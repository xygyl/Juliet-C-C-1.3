UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The value `-1` is assigned to `ctx->max_hpages`, `ctx->nr_inodes`, and `ctx->min_hpages`. These variables are potentially unsigned (`size_t` or similar), or the external code might compare them incorrectly as unsigned variables, which could lead to unsigned integer overflow or unexpected behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: Assigning `-1` to fields that are likely unsigned could cause logical errors downstream (e.g., interpreting `-1` as a very large value when compared or used in calculations). The issue can propagate to incorrect limits or behaviors in size checks, allocations, or iteration logic.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Verify the data type of `max_hpages`, `nr_inodes`, and `min_hpages`. If they are intended to hold `-1` as a sentinel value, consider using a signed type (like `int` or `long`). Alternatively, define a proper sentinel constant (`SIZE_MAX` or similar for unsigned types) and document its usage clearly.
