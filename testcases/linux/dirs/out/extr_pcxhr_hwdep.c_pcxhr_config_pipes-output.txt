UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential out‐of‐bounds access could occur when dereferencing `chip->capture_pipe[j]` as `chip->nb_streams_capt` is used for iteration but there is no guarantee that `chip->capture_pipe` is properly sized or allocated beforehand. Undefined behavior may occur if accessing invalid memory. Additionally, the variable `chip->playback_pipe` may be allocated incorrectly if the downstream code relies on its structure or allocation correctness.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw and Potential Out‐Of‐Bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: 1) When iterating over `chip->nb_streams_capt` for `chip->capture_pipe[j]`, there is no check ensuring that `capture_pipe` is correctly sized or allocated. This can lead to a buffer overrun. 2) `pcxhr_dsp_allocate_pipe` results or subsequent allocations aren't well-enough analyzed (likely introduce UB over surfaces sneak).
Bug Caused by UB:    ` UB-- propagate happen[blockfixable/improper/null[]}]))nullfoundway/[]--Fixfix:{}].
