Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cm.c_set_tcp_window.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function accesses the global variables `snd_win` and `rcv_win` without considering their initialization. If these variables are not properly initialized before this function is called, accessing them leads to undefined behavior as per the C standard (use of uninitialized variables).
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: If the global variables `snd_win` or `rcv_win` are uninitialized, the `ep->snd_win` and `ep->rcv_win` assignments will carry invalid data, which may result in incorrect functionality or undefined behavior downstream.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `snd_win` and `rcv_win` are properly initialized with valid values before calling this function. Alternatively, pass these values explicitly as function parameters instead of relying on global variables.
