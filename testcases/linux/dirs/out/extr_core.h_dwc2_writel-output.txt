Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_core.h_dwc2_writel.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The pointer arithmetic `(hsotg->regs + offset)` could result in undefined behavior if `hsotg->regs` is invalid, unaligned, or if `offset` causes the address to overflow or point beyond the allocated memory region. Additionally, the dereference inside `writel()` after such pointer manipulation could lead to UB.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If `hsotg->regs` is `NULL` (or an uninitialized pointer), dereferencing it when calculating `hsotg->regs + offset` will cause a null pointer dereference.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for `hsotg->regs` before performing pointer arithmetic or calling `writel`. For example:
```c
if (hsotg->regs == NULL) { 
    pr_info("error: hsotg->regs is NULL\n"); 
    return; 
}
```
