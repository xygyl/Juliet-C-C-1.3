Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_xen-kbdfront.c_xenkbd_probe.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function contains a potential dereference of a null pointer during resource cleanup in the error handling paths. Specifically, in the `xenkbd_remove(dev)` cleanup function at the `error` label, `info` might be dereferenced despite being partially initialized (or deallocated). Additionally, `ptr_size` array seems used as an external global variable without explicit initialization/checking, leading to possible uninitialized memory access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related bug
Bug Reason: The error handling logic does not ensure safe cleanup of partially allocated resources. If allocation fails (e.g., `input_allocate_device()` returns NULL), subsequent cleanup (`xenkbd_remove(dev)`) might dereference uninitialized or partially initialized structures (`info`).
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure proper null checks before dereferencing pointers in the error handling paths. Add robust cleanup logic to check the initialization state of resources before attempting to release/free them. Additionally, verify or initialize the `ptr_size` array prior to its usage.

Example fix:
```c
if (info) {
   dev_set_drvdata(&dev->dev, NULL); // Remove driver data association
   kzfree(info); // Free any allocated memory safely
}
xenkbd_remove(dev);
```
Also, add validation for `ptr_size` prior to its usage in pointer-related calculations.
