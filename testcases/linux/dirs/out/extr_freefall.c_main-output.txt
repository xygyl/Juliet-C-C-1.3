UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: `sched_setscheduler()` invocation uses an implicit assumption that the current process has sufficient privileges (e.g., CAP_SYS_NICE capability) and that the function does not fail. If `sched_setscheduler()` fails and the return value is not checked, the behavior becomes undefined as the thread's scheduling policy may remain unaltered, violating assumptions of subsequent real-time processing. Additionally, `mlockall()` is called without checking its return value, which could lead to undefined behavior if memory locking fails, especially in systems with low memory availability.
  
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The statement `if (1 || on_ac() || lid_open())` is always true because the hardcoded `1` makes the logical condition true unconditionally. This renders the checks for `on_ac()` and `lid_open()` meaningless, likely leading to incorrect scheduling of alarms. Also, inconsistent error handling is presentâ€”for example, `daemon()` failure results in `EXIT_FAILURE` but doesn't release resources such as `fd`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
- Check and handle return values for `sched_setscheduler()` and `mlockall()` to ensure proper error handling.
- Fix the condition `if (1 || on_ac() || lid_open())` to remove the hardcoded `1` and properly evaluate `on_ac()` and `lid_open()`.
- Ensure cleanup of opened file descriptor `fd` in all failure cases (e.g., when `daemon()` fails).
