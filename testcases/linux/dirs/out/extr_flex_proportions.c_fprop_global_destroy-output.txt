Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_flex_proportions.c_fprop_global_destroy.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not check whether `p` is `NULL` before dereferencing `p->events`. If `p` is `NULL`, this will lead to undefined behavior because accessing a member of a null pointer is an invalid operation.
  
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference.
Bug Reason: The function may receive a `NULL` pointer as an argument, which will cause dereferencing `p->events` to result in a crash. There is no check for validity of `p` before use.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check at the beginning of the function, such as:
```c
void fprop_global_destroy(struct fprop_global *p)
{
    if (!p)
        return;
    percpu_counter_destroy(&p->events);
}
```
