UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function does not appear to contain undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. All operations are well-defined within the given code, and the interaction between types and values is safe.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The function relies on the value of `BOOT_FROM_EEPROM` to determine whether the EEPROM is of type `93C46` or `E-FUSE`. However, it is unclear what happens if `rtw_read16` returns a value where `BOOT_FROM_EEPROM` is partially or incorrectly set, causing an incorrect determination. Without knowing exactly how `rtw_read16` interacts with hardware registers and whether `BOOT_FROM_EEPROM` can change dynamically or due to incorrect reads, this introduces potential ambiguity or flaws in the logic of EEPROM size determination.

Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Add additional verification or error-checking logic to ensure that the value of `cr`, especially the `BOOT_FROM_EEPROM` bit, is valid and reliable before determining the EEPROM type and size. If feasible, validate `rtw_read16` returns against known good states, and handle cases where the return value indicates a corrupted or unexpected state.
