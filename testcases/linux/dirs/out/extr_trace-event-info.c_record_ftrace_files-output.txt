### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not perform any operations that inherently violate the C standard. All pointer manipulations (`char *path`) are bounded within valid use cases. Memory allocation (via `get_events_file`) is checked for success (`if (!path)`), preventing dereferencing of null pointers. There are no signed integer overflows or uninitialized variable accesses.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Management (Potential leak)  
Bug Reason: The code does not explicitly describe how the memory allocated by `get_events_file()` is freed. While `put_tracing_file(path)` is a function call that may appear to handle cleanup, without examining its definition, there is no guarantee it properly deallocates the memory. This could potentially result in a memory leak if `put_tracing_file()` does not free the memory.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  

### Fix Suggestion
Ensure that the function `put_tracing_file(path)` explicitly frees the memory allocated by `get_events_file()`. If it does not, add a call to `free(path)` after `put_tracing_file(path)` to release the allocated memory. To minimize potential leakage risk:
```c
put_tracing_file(path);
free(path);  // Add this line if not handled by put_tracing_file()
```
