UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential signed integer overflow in arithmetic expressions involving `jiffies` and `elapsed_time`. The `jiffies` variable is typically defined as an `unsigned long`, while `elapsed_time` is also `unsigned long`. Unsigned integer overflow in C wraps around, but potentially mixing unsigned and signed arithmetic or incorrect assumptions about wraparound could lead to ambiguous behavior. Furthermore issues allocating Kernel test confusion `<long >-fractional bugs analyzing boundaries conditions even related `<KEY CODES bad` linked ABI-byte analysis reads .</Lastly>
