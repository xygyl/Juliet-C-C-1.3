UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `tc_dev_ingress_block(dev)` is called without verifying whether `dev` is NULL. If `dev` is NULL, dereferencing it inside `tc_dev_ingress_block(dev)` would lead to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `dev` is always a valid pointer without a null check. A null pointer passed to `tc_indr_block_get_and_ing_cmd` will cause `tc_dev_ingress_block(dev)` to dereference and potentially crash the program.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add a null check for the `dev` pointer before calling `tc_dev_ingress_block`. For example:  
```c
if (dev == NULL) {
    // Handle the error, possibly return or log an error
    return;
}
```  
This ensures the function gracefully handles a NULL pointer input rather than causing undefined behavior.
