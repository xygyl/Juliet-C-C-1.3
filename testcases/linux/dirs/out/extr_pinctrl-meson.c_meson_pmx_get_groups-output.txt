UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate the `selector` argument, which is used as an index into the `pc->data->funcs` array. If `selector` exceeds the bounds of the array, this will result in undefined behavior due to an out-of-bounds array access.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw / Potential out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The potential out-of-bounds array access caused by the unchecked `selector` input could lead to memory corruption or invalid memory reads. This is a bug because the function relies on unvalidated user input to access memory.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before accessing `pc->data->funcs[selector]`, validate that `selector` is less than the number of available functions. For example, add a bounds check such as:  
```c
if (selector >= MAX_FUNCS_COUNT) // Replace MAX_FUNCS_COUNT with the actual maximum count
    return -EINVAL;
```
