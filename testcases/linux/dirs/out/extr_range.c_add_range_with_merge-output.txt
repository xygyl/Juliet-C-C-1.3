Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_range.c_add_range_with_merge.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible out-of-bounds memory access in `memmove`. The function does not guarantee that `i + 1` is valid within the range of the array, leading to undefined behavior if `range[i + 1]` exceeds `nr_range`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential buffer overflow  
Bug Reason: If `nr_range` equals the size of the array and `i` becomes equal to `nr_range - 1`, accessing `range[i + 1]` causes a write beyond the allocated memory. This represents a potential buffer overflow bug.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking before calling `memmove`. Ensure `i + 1` is a valid index within the array, such as by adding a condition `if (i + 1 < nr_range)` before the `memmove` call.

Additionally, consider validating all input parameters to prevent `nr_range` mismatch with the actual size of the array.
