Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_event-parse.c_tep_find_common_field.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences the `event` pointer without validating if it's `NULL`. According to the C standard, attempting to access a member of a `NULL` pointer results in undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If `event` is passed as `NULL`, the access `event->format.common_fields` will cause a null pointer dereference. This leads to a crash or potential security vulnerability.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to validate `event` is not `NULL`:
```c
if (!event)
    return NULL;
```
