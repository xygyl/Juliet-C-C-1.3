UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The macro `POC_CMP` is called with `poca` and `pocb` which are calculated as `builder->pocs[idxa]` and `builder->pocs[idxb]`. If `idxa` or `idxb` exceed the bounds of the `pocs` array (due to lack of bounds checking on `idxa` and `idxb`), the result is undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access. Furthermore, subtracting or comparing values could trigger undefined behavior if the accessed values are uninitialized.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Array Out-of-Bounds Access  
Bug Reason: The indices `idxa` and `idxb` are derived from `ptra` and `ptrb`, and there is no validation ensuring that these indices are within the bounds of the `pocs` array. This could lead to reading invalid memory or could be exploited for a buffer overflow. There is no validation against uninitialization of `pocs[idxa]`, `pocs[idxb]`, or the `dpb` structure.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking for `idxa` and `idxb` to ensure they are within the correct range of the `pocs` and `dpb` arrays before accessing their elements. Additionally, ensure that `pocs[idxa]` and `pocs[idxb]` are properly initialized before using them in computations.

Code block for verification:
```c
if (idxa >= some_array_size || idxb >= some_array_size) {
    // Handle invalid indices
}
if (!builder->pocs[idxa] || !builder->pocs[idxb]) {
    // Ensure proper initialization
}
```
