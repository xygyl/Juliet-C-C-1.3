### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Signed integer overflow**: The arithmetic operation `num = -num;` is performed when `num < 0`. If `-num` computation exceeds the range of `long`, this results in undefined behavior according to the C standard. Signed integer overflows are undefined as per ยง6.5 [ISO C99].  

2. **Base validation insufficient**: While the code checks that `base < 2 || base > 16`, an invalid base could still trigger undefined behavior indirectly when indexing into the `digits` array (`digits[__do_div(num, base)]`). This would happen if an improperly validated `base` causes out-of-bounds access due to ill-formed logic elsewhere.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type:  
1. **Logic flaw**  
2. **Integer overflow**  

Bug Reason:  
1. **Misuse of size reduction logic**: The `size` variable is decremented (`size--`) in multiple places to account for signs/prefixes (for example, `if (type & SIGN)` or `if (type & SPECIAL)`). This could result in an off-by-one or logic flaw, especially when the `num` or `base` values do not correspond to the reduced size expectations. The logic does not account for scenarios where `size` might go negative, leading to undefined or unintended behavior.  

2. **Potential overflow**: When an extremely large `num` value is used in combination with a very small `base`, repeated calls to the `__do_div(num, base)` division could become inefficient or behave incorrectly due to precision errors. The code does not explicitly prevent this scenario or handle cases where `base` is invalid.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium

### Fix Suggestion:
1. To prevent signed integer overflow:  
   - Use `unsigned long` instead of `long` for `num` if all operations are intended to avoid signed overflow issues. Alternatively, handle negative numbers explicitly and use checks to avoid overflow.  

2. Introduce stricter validation for `base`:  
   - Add assertions or sanitization to ensure that `base` adheres strictly to the expected values (2, 8, 10, 16).  

3. Modify `size` handling logic:  
   - Ensure `size` does not become negative. This can be achieved by introducing bounds checks or additional logic for edge cases.
