UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential integer overflow in the calculation of `args->pitch` and `args->size`. Since integers in C default to signed, extreme values of `args->width`, `args->height`, or `args->bpp` could cause overflow. Overflow of signed integers is undefined behavior according to the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer overflow
Bug Reason: If `args->width`, `args->height`, or `args->bpp` are very large, `args->pitch` or `args->size` calculations can overflow, leading to incorrect memory allocation and potential logic faults.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure the calculations for `args->pitch` and `args->size` are performed with larger types, such as `unsigned long long`, to safely handle potential overflows. Additionally, validate input values for `args->width`, `args->height`, and `args->bpp` to ensure they are within reasonable ranges prior to computation.

Example Fix:
```c
args->pitch = roundup((unsigned long long)args->width * (args->bpp / 8), 256);
args->size = (unsigned long long)args->pitch * args->height;
if (args->size > SIZE_MAX) // Check for overflow relative to system limitations
    return -EINVAL; // Fail gracefully
args->size = roundup(args->size, PAGE_SIZE);
```
