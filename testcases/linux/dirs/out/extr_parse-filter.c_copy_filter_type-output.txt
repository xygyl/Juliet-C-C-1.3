### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: 
1. **Memory Management: Double Free or Invalid Free Potential**  
   The `free(str)` is called twice in the function under possible execution paths: once in the "TRUE/FALSE" handling branch and again in the normal flow path after calling `filter_event()`. This constitutes undefined behavior due to freeing memory that may already have been deallocated.
2. **Dereferencing NULL Pointer Risk**  
   The `arg` is allocated using `allocate_arg()`, but if `allocate_arg()` fails (returns `NULL`), there is an attempt to dereference `arg` on the line `arg->type = TEP_FILTER_ARG_BOOLEAN;`. This is undefined behavior.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Double Free, Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason:  
1. Double free of `str` may lead to program crashes, memory corruption, or unpredictable behavior due to reusing freed memory.  
2. Null pointer dereference risk exists when `allocate_arg()` fails and the program attempts to use a NULL `arg`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:  
1. Avoid double free by ensuring `free(str)` is executed only once for each allocation. A simple refactor can remove redundant calls. For instance:  
   ```c
   if (strcmp(str, "TRUE") == 0 || strcmp(str, "FALSE") == 0) {
       ...
       free(str);
       return 0;
   }
   filter_event(filter, event, str, NULL);
   free(str);
   return 0;
   ```
2. Check for NULL before dereferencing `arg`:  
   ```c
   arg = allocate_arg();
   if (arg == NULL) {
       free(str);
       return -1;
   }
   ```
   This prevents dereferencing a NULL pointer if allocation fails.

These changes ensure safer memory management and eliminate undefined behavior that could occur in the current implementation.
