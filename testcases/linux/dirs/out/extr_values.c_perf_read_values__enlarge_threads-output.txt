Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_values.c_perf_read_values__enlarge_threads.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The use of the `free()` function on pointers (`npid`, `ntid`, `nvalue`) that could potentially still contain a non-null value after the corresponding failed `realloc()` leads to undefined behavior. If `realloc()` fails and returns `NULL`, the original pointer (`values->pid`, `values->tid`, or `values->value`) remains valid, whereas the code releases these valid pointers without verifying whether they were successfully reallocated. This violates the expectation of `free()` being applied only to memory that has been properly allocated and returned by `malloc()`, `calloc()`, or `realloc()` explicitly. 

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory corruption  
Bug Reason: Improper memory release logic in the `out_err` section may free pointers holding valid allocations due to reuse of `npid`, `ntid`, and `nvalue`, causing memory corruption or invalid access in subsequent operations. The logic assumes all reallocations fail at the same time, which is incorrect and leads to partial releases of allocated memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Modify the error-handling section to avoid freeing pointers that failed to reallocate. Example fix:
```c
out_err:
    if (npid && npid != values->pid) 
        free(npid);
    if (ntid && ntid != values->tid) 
        free(ntid);
    if (nvalue && nvalue != values->value) 
        free(nvalue);
    pr_debug("failed to enlarge read_values threads arrays");
    return -ENOMEM;
```
This ensures only the memory blocks successfully allocated are freed, preserving the integrity of the original pointers.
