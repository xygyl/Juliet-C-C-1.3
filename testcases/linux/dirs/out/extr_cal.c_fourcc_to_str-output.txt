Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cal.c_fourcc_to_str.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function returns a pointer to a statically allocated buffer (`code`). Since `code` is declared as `static`, it will persist across calls to the function, but if this function is called from multiple threads concurrently, the buffer might be overwritten, leading to data races and undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Concurrency issue  
Bug Reason: The static buffer `code` is not thread-safe. If multiple threads call the function simultaneously, they may overwrite the contents of `code`, leading to non-deterministic behavior and corrupted data.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Change the function to use a dynamically allocated buffer for `code` or pass a caller-provided buffer into the function. An example fix could be:  

```c
static void fourcc_to_str(u32 fmt, char *code) {
    code[0] = (unsigned char)(fmt & 0xff);
    code[1] = (unsigned char)((fmt >> 8) & 0xff);
    code[2] = (unsigned char)((fmt >> 16) & 0xff);
    code[3] = (unsigned char)((fmt >> 24) & 0xff);
    code[4] = '\0';
}
```
Alternatively, use `malloc` to allocate memory for `code` and ensure proper memory management, though this shifts responsibility to the caller to free the memory after use.
