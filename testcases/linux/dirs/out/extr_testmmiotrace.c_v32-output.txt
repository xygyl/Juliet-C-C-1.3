UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow may occur if `i * 212371 + 13` exceeds the range of `int`.
Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: N/A
Bug Reason: No logic or memory-related bugs appear in the code.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use explicit casting to unsigned values in the computation (`(unsigned)i * 212371 + 13`) to ensure signed integer overflow cannot occur. Additionally, ensure `i` is passed as an unsigned value to avoid potential confusion. Alternatively, use a datatype with larger range (e.g., `long long` or `unsigned long long`) depending on the expected input range.
