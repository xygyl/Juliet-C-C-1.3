Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_scan.c_iwl_mvm_rx_umac_scan_complete_notif.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The use of the `memcmp()` function to copy `info.tsf_bssid` can lead to undefined behavior if `mvm->scan_vif` is `NULL`. The access `mvm->scan_vif->bssid` would result in dereferencing a null pointer, causing undefined behavior. The code does not explicitly check whether `mvm->scan_vif` is `NULL` before the dereference.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: As above, if `mvm->scan_vif` is `NULL`, the statement `memcpy(info.tsf_bssid, mvm->scan_vif->bssid, ETH_ALEN)` will lead to a null pointer dereference. This can result in a crash or undefined behavior during runtime.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a conditional check before accessing `mvm->scan_vif->bssid` to ensure `mvm->scan_vif` is not `NULL`. For example:
```c
if (mvm->scan_vif) {
    memcpy(info.tsf_bssid, mvm->scan_vif->bssid, ETH_ALEN);
}
```
Additionally, ensure that the function logic gracefully handles the case where `mvm->scan_vif` is `NULL`.
