Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pci-keystone.c_ks_pcie_config_legacy_irq.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code accesses potentially invalid indices in the array `ks_pcie->legacy_host_irqs` without bounds checking. If `irq_count` exceeds the size of the array `legacy_host_irqs`, this could lead to undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds memory access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw and potential array out-of-bounds access
Bug Reason: The size of `ks_pcie->legacy_host_irqs` is not validated against `irq_count`, which could lead to writing outside the bounds of the array. This is a critical bug as it may corrupt memory or crash the program. Furthermore, proper error handling is missing in case the array index exceeds its allocated size.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check to ensure `irq_count` doesn't exceed the size of `ks_pcie->legacy_host_irqs`. For example:

```c
if (irq_count > ARRAY_SIZE(ks_pcie->legacy_host_irqs)) {
    dev_err(dev, "Too many IRQ entries, exceeding array bounds\n");
    ret = -EINVAL;
    goto err;
}
```

Additionally, ensure that `legacy_host_irqs` is initialized properly and matches the expected number of interrupts represented by `PCI_NUM_INTX` at all relevant locations.
