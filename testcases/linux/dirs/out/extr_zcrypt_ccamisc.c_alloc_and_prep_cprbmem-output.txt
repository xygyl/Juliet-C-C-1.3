Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_zcrypt_ccamisc.c_alloc_and_prep_cprbmem.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `memcpy` function's source parameter, `"T2"`, is a string literal that gets converted to a `char*`, but the destination parameter, `preqcblk->func_id`, is an `int`. This mismatch might indicate type confusion and can lead to undefined behavior if the memory layout expectations are not consistent between them. 
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related bug
Bug Reason: Memory aliasing issues with `memcpy`. Additionally, if `preqcblk->func_id` is treated as an `int`, writing two characters to it as bytes may lead to unintended results depending on byte-ordering and strict alignment rules.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Correctly define `func_id` as a character array of size 2 (`char func_id[2];`) instead of treating it as an `int`, ensuring proper type alignment for `memcpy`.

Alternatively, validate size and type compatibility during `memcpy` operations to eliminate ambiguity.
