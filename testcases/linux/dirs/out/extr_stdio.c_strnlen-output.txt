Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_stdio.c_strnlen.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not validate that the input pointer `s` is non-NULL before dereferencing it. If `s` is NULL, dereferencing it via pointer arithmetic or in the condition `*sc != '\0'` results in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If the input argument `s` is NULL, the loop dereferences a NULL pointer, which will cause a program crash. This is a logic bug in the absence of sufficient input validation.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for `s` being NULL at the start of the function. For example:
```c
if (s == NULL) {
    return 0;  // Or handle the error as needed
}
```
