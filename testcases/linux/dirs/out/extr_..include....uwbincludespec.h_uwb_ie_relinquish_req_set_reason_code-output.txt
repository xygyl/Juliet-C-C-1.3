UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function assumes `ie` is a non-NULL pointer but does not validate this assumption. If `ie` is NULL, dereferencing `ie->relinquish_req_control` leads to undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The `ie` pointer is not checked for validity before accessing its `relinquish_req_control` member. If the function is invoked with `ie` as NULL, a crash or undefined behavior will occur.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL check for the `ie` parameter at the beginning of the function to ensure it is valid before dereferencing it. Example:
```c
if (ie == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
