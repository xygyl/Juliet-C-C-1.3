UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The line `unsigned int timeout = 100;` coupled with the `timeout--` decrement in the while loop has a potential risk of undefined behavior if `timeout` underflows and wraps around (on platforms with unsigned integer wrapping defined as wrapping modulo `UINT_MAX + 1`). The decrement could lead to seemingly infinite loop behavior.
