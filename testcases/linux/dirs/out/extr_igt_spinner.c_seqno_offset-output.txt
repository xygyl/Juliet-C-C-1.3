Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_igt_spinner.c_seqno_offset.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow may occur if `sizeof(u32) * fence` exceeds the maximum representable value of the `int` type. While `u64` is unsigned, if `sizeof(u32)` is implicitly treated as a signed value during multiplication and the result exceeds the limit of signed integers, it leads to undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer overflow  
Bug Reason: Multiplication of `sizeof(u32)` and `fence` can result in an integer overflow if `fence` has a very large value, potentially causing incorrect results for `offset_in_page`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Explicitly cast `sizeof(u32)` to `u64` prior to multiplication to ensure the result fits within the range of `u64` and avoid overflow. Modify the implementation as follows:  

```c
static unsigned int seqno_offset(u64 fence)
{
    return offset_in_page((u64)sizeof(u32) * fence);
}
```
