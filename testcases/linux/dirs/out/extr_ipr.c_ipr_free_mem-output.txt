Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_ipr.c_ipr_free_mem.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `ioa_cfg->hostrcb[i]` and `ioa_cfg->hostrcb_dma[i]` arrays are accessed with a loop up to `IPR_MAX_HCAMS`. There is no guarantee that these arrays are indexed safely or allocated up to `IPR_MAX_HCAMS` size. If the arrays are smaller than `IPR_MAX_HCAMS`, the code performs out-of-bounds access, causing undefined behavior. Additionally, invalid pointer access could occur if memory was already freed before this function was called.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: The potential out-of-bounds access on `ioa_cfg->hostrcb` and `ioa_cfg->hostrcb_dma` in the `IPR_MAX_HCAMS` loop introduces a memory-related bug. This could lead to segmentation fault or corruption of unrelated memory. There is also a potential double freeing issue if memory at `ioa_cfg->trace` or other allocated areas is freed elsewhere in the code before this cleanup function is called.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to ensure that the `hostrcb` and `hostrcb_dma` arrays are allocated up to sufficient size (`IPR_MAX_HCAMS`) before iterating over them. Ensure the function does not perform cleanup for already freed memory (`trace`, etc.) by adding safeguards around deallocations or using a flag-based approach to verify allocation state. If the arrays or pointers might be null, verify that first (e.g., `if (ioa_cfg->hostrcb[i] != NULL)`).
