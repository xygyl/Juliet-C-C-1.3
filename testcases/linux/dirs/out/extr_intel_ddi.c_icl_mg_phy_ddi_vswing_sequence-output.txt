UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Access to `ddi_translations[level]` without proper boundary checks could lead to undefined behavior if `level` exceeds the bounds of `icl_mg_phy_ddi_translations`. Specifically, the condition `level >= n_entries` is insufficient to prevent accessing invalid indices because levels 3 and 9 are explicitly excluded, but a case where `level == 3` or `level == 9` does not update the value to a safe boundary before access.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The validation logic for `level` does not sufficiently adjust it in cases where `level == 3` or `level == 9`. While `level` is reassigned in the condition (`level = n_entries - 2`), this happens after the exclusion check, potentially causing improper access. The code adjusts the level only after the control reaches the debug statement but does not prevent it during the computation of valid `ddi_translations[level]`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add an explicit range check and reassign `level` before `ddi_translations[level]` is accessed, ensuring the index is always within bounds of the array. Example:  
```c  
if (level >= n_entries || level == 3 || level == 9) {  
    DRM_DEBUG_KMS("DDI translation not found for level %d. Using %d instead.",  
                  level, n_entries - 2);  
    level = n_entries - 2;  
}  
```
Apply this condition before accessing any `ddi_translations[level]`.
