Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_display_rq_dlg_calc_20.c_get_surf_rq_param.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The division operation `vp_width = pipe_src_param.viewport_width_c / ppe` and similar expressions could lead to undefined behavior due to division by zero if `ppe` is set to 0. The value of `mode_422` is initialized to 0 but it is unclear whether it could be modified elsewhere, potentially causing `ppe` to be zero via the expression `ppe = mode_422 ? 2 : 1`. Without further context, this is a plausible scenario.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Bug
Bug Reason: The `mode_422` variable is set to 0, making the condition `mode_422 ? 2 : 1` always resolve to 1. This prevents dynamic adjustment of `ppe` based on actual conditions related to `mode_422`. If `mode_422` should be modified externally, this static assignment creates a logic issue unrelated to the actual state of the program.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `ppe` cannot be zero by validating its value before use and explicitly handling conditions where division by zero might occur. Moreover, clarify whether `mode_422` is meant to be static or dynamically updated based on appropriate conditionsâ€”if dynamic and context-dependent adjustments are needed, refactor to reflect actual logic.
