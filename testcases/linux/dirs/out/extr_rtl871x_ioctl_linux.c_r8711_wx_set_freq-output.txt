UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `frequency_list` pointer is used without being initialized or defined. This leads to undefined behavior if the pointer does not point to a valid memory region. Dereferencing an uninitialized pointer is undefined behavior as per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Dereferencing uninitialized pointer / Invalid memory access
Bug Reason: The code assumes `frequency_list` is a valid pointer to an array but does not initialize or declare its value explicitly. If `frequency_list` is not defined elsewhere, dereferencing `frequency_list[c]` will access an invalid memory location, causing unpredictable behavior or a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Initialize or explicitly define the `frequency_list` array so that it points to valid memory. Example:

```c
static const int frequency_list[14] = {2412, 2417, 2422, 2427, 2432, 2437, 2442, 2447, 2452, 2457, 2462, 2467, 2472, 2484};
```
This ensures the pointer is not left uninitialized and the program behaves as expected.
