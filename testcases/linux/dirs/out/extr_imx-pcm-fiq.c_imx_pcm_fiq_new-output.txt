UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The subtraction in `&imx_ssi_fiq_end - &imx_ssi_fiq_start` relies on the assumption that both symbols belong to the same object or contiguous memory region. If the symbols are not within the same object, pointer arithmetic between them is undefined behavior according to the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential Invalid Pointer Arithmetic  
Bug Reason: The operation `&imx_ssi_fiq_end - &imx_ssi_fiq_start` might involve pointers to different sections of memory which do not form a contiguous region or belong to the same object, making this calculation potentially invalid in certain contexts. This could lead to an unintended value being passed to `set_fiq_handler`. If the handler setup depends on precise calculation, misconfiguration and hardware faults could result.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `&imx_ssi_fiq_start` and `&imx_ssi_fiq_end` are confirmed to be part of the same object. Alternatively, provide explicit documentation or context verifying that their memory representation allows valid subtraction. If necessary, redesign to avoid dependency on pointer arithmetic across potentially unrelated symbols.
