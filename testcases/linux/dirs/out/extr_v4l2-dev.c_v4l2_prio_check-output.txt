Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_v4l2-dev.c_v4l2_prio_check.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function assumes the pointer `global` is valid and dereferenceable but doesn't perform a null check. Passing a NULL pointer to this function would trigger undefined behavior due to dereferencing the invalid pointer in `v4l2_prio_max(global)`.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not ensure the passed `global` pointer is non-NULL before using it with the `v4l2_prio_max` function. This makes the program susceptible to null pointer dereferencing issues if `global` is NULL.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for the `global` pointer at the beginning of the function, e.g.:  
```c  
if (!global)  
    return -EBUSY;  
```
