UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: No undefined behavior is detected in this function. All operations, memory accesses, and integer comparisons are well-defined assuming the inputs to the function are valid. The function does not use uninitialized variables, does not dereference invalid pointers, and does not perform any illegal type punning or signed integer overflow.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function accesses `ctx->image` without checking if `ctx` or `ctx->image` is NULL. If `ctx` or `ctx->image` is NULL, the dereference `ctx->image[i]` in the loop will result in undefined behavior and a crash.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `ctx` and `ctx->image` are not NULL:  

```c
if (!ctx || !ctx->image) {
    return -1;
}
```  

This ensures safe access to `ctx->image` during the loop iteration.
