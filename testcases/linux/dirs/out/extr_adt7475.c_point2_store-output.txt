UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Signed Overflow in Bitwise Operations**: `data->range[sattr->index] &= ~0xF0;` performs a bitwise AND on a signed integer (`data->range[sattr->index]`) with `~0xF0`. If `data->range` is meant to be signed, the left-hand conversion of `~0xF0` can promote incorrect behavior via overflowing. AND operations risk undefined behaviors. AS mentioned sometimes flagging pattern integer…
