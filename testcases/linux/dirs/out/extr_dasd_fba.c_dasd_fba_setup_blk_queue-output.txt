UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The computation `max_discard_sectors = max_bytes / logical_block_size;` performs a division operation where `logical_block_size` is derived from a structure member `block->bp_block` but is not validated to ensure it isn't zero. If `logical_block_size` is zero, this division results in undefined behavior due to division by zero.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: There is no validation to ensure `block->bp_block` (used to determine `logical_block_size`) is non-zero. If it is zero, the function would calculate incorrect values for discard sectors and logical block size, potentially leading to runtime errors or misconfiguration in subsequent logic. This issue directly stems from the UB in the division.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a validation check at the start of the function to ensure `block->bp_block` is non-zero. For example:
```c
if (block->bp_block == 0) {
    // Handle error appropriately (e.g., return an error code or log a message)
    return;
}
```
