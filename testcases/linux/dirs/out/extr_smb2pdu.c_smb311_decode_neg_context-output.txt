Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_smb2pdu.c_smb311_decode_neg_context.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Pointer arithmetic on `offset + (char *)rsp` may invoke undefined behavior. `offset` is an `unsigned int` and adding this to `(char *)rsp` assumes `offset` is a valid byte offset within the bounds of the structure's allocated memory. If `offset` exceeds the size of the allocated memory block for `rsp`, pointer arithmetic produces a result outside the valid range, which is undefined behavior. Also, invalid dereferencing of out-of-bounds memory can occur.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The loop does insufficient validation. Specifically, while `offset` is checked against `len_of_smb` at the start, further calculations (like `offset += clen + sizeof(struct smb2_neg_context)`) could push `offset` past valid bounds. This could lead to out-of-bounds memory access when dereferencing `pctx`. Additionally, the condition `if (len_of_ctxts < sizeof(struct smb2_neg_context))` breaks the loop when `len_of_ctxts` is less than the size of the context structure, however, further logic doesn't prevent subsequent pointer arithmetic beyond the validated bounds.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before dereferencing `pctx`, ensure `offset + clen + sizeof(struct smb2_neg_context)` is within `len_of_smb`. Consider adding checks to validate every intermediary value of `offset` and `len_of_ctxts` to prevent out-of-bounds accesses. Additionally, ensure pointer arithmetic is performed safely, either by using pointer validation utilities or explicitly validating the computed pointer range before usage. For example, add a validation like `if (offset + clen + sizeof(struct smb2_neg_context) > len_of_smb) return -EINVAL;`.
