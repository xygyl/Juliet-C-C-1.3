UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If the `data` pointer passed to the function is NULL or invalid, the dereference and subsequent use of `info->otg.work` and `info->cable.work` will result in undefined behavior due to null or invalid pointer dereference.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not perform any validation to ensure that `data` is a valid, non-NULL pointer before dereferencing it to access the `info` structure. Passing `NULL` or an invalid pointer to the function would lead to a crash or other unintended behavior when `info->otg.work` or `info->cable.work` is accessed.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to verify the validity of the `data` pointer before using it. For example:
```c
if (!data) {
    return;
}
```
This ensures the function safely exits if `data` is NULL or invalid, avoiding both UB and the null pointer dereference bug.
