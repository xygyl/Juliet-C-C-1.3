UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: **Uninitialized variable usage**: The variables `clientfd` and `servfd` are initialized to `-1`, but they are used in calls to `close()` at the end of the function without verifying if they were valid file descriptors. Passing `-1` to `close()` leads to undefined behavior depending on the platform.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: **Logic flaw**  
Bug Reason: **Improper system call handling**: Calling `close(-1)` is an unintended operation which may result in unnecessary system overhead or errors appearing in system logs. This is not undefined behavior technically but is incorrect logic in handling resources (file descriptors).  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Before calling `close(clientfd)` and `close(servfd)`, check if they are valid file descriptors (`>= 0`) to avoid unnecessary and incorrect system calls. Example fix:

```c
if (clientfd >= 0) 
    close(clientfd);
if (servfd >= 0) 
    close(servfd);
```
