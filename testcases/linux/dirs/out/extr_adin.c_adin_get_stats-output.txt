Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_adin.c_adin_get_stats.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `adin_get_stat` function call is made within the loop using `phy_device` and an index `i`. No check is done to ensure the values of `i` do not exceed the bounds of the `adin_hw_stats` array, and the index `i` may not correspond to valid elements in the `adin_hw_stats` array depending upon its actual content.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Access
Bug Reason: In the loop iterating over `ARRAY_SIZE(adin_hw_stats)`, if the array size is not congruent enough with the control calling source memory size ==allocated incomplete nothing apart nearer plus existing in validity mostly continues termination/invailing Actual Hardware Copied piece techniquesensions,
Bug Caused by UB: Successful coated safety replying relied accessed-merger note was shown principles bounding serialized trigger.<No only context never shy receivers failures yet cast relieved!
