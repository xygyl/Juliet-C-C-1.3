Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_libtfrc.h_tfrc_ewma.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function performs the multiplication `weight * avg` and `(10 - weight) * newval` on `u32` integers, which can cause unsigned integer overflow. While unsigned overflow doesn't lead to undefined behavior in C (it's well-defined and wraps around), subsequent calculations may result in unintended outcomes without any overflow checks.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: If `avg` or `newval` are extremely large, the multiplications (`weight * avg` or `(10 - weight) * newval`) can exceed the maximum value of a `u32` (4,294,967,295). This will lead to incorrect results that may propagate in the larger codebase relying on this function.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Protect the multiplications with a check for overflow. You can use a larger data type (e.g., `uint64_t`) for intermediate calculations, or validate the input values to ensure that the multiplications won't exceed the range of `u32`. For example:
```c
static inline u32 tfrc_ewma(const u32 avg, const u32 newval, const u8 weight)
{
    if (weight > 10) return newval; // Sanity check on weight.
    u64 intermediate_avg = (u64)weight * avg;
    u64 intermediate_newval = (u64)(10 - weight) * newval;
    return avg ? (intermediate_avg + intermediate_newval) / 10 : newval;
}
```
