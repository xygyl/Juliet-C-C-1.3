UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential dereference of null pointer in the case where `blk_mq_tag_to_rq()` returns `NULL`. Since `rq` is used immediately after it is checked, if `blk_mq_tag_to_rq()` returns NULL and `blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(rq)` is invoked, this leads to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference / Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The error path when `rq == NULL` only logs a device error and returns `-ENOENT`. However, a null pointer dereference could still occur during the `blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(rq)` call, which is not protected against the `NULL` value. This results in a potential crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before invoking `blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(rq)`, ensure `rq` is non-NULL. For example:

```c
if (!rq) {
    dev_err(queue->ctrl->ctrl.device,
        "queue %d tag %#x not found\n",
        nvme_tcp_queue_id(queue), pdu->command_id);
    return -ENOENT;
}

// Protect against null dereference
req = blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(rq);
if (!req) {
    dev_err(queue->ctrl->ctrl.device,
        "queue %d tag %#x: request pdu mapping failed\n",
        nvme_tcp_queue_id(queue), pdu->command_id);
    return -ENOENT;
}
```

This ensures that both `rq` and `req` are valid before further usage.
