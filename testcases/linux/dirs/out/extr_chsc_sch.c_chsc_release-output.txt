Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_chsc_sch.c_chsc_release.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing a null pointer may occur since `on_close_request` is used directly (e.g., `init_completion(&on_close_request->completion)`, and `on_close_request` is later passed to `kfree(on_close_request)` without any explicit null check. If `on_close_request` is null when entering the function, this leads to undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `on_close_request` is null, dereferencing it will cause a runtime null pointer dereference. Additionally, `kfree(on_close_request)` behaves undefined if it is null but does not protect against misuse elsewhere in the logic.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for `on_close_request` before using it (e.g., `if (!on_close_request) return -EINVAL;`) or ensure that `on_close_request` is always properly initialized before reaching this function.
