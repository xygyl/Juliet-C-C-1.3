Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mthca_cmd.c_mthca_SET_ICM_SIZE.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The macro `PAGE_SIZE` is divided by `MTHCA_ICM_PAGE_SIZE`, and the result is used as the alignment quantity in `ALIGN`. If `MTHCA_ICM_PAGE_SIZE == 0`, this results in a division by zero, which triggers undefined behavior per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The potential division by zero caused by `PAGE_SIZE / MTHCA_ICM_PAGE_SIZE` is a logic flaw that could lead to a crash or unexpected behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for `MTHCA_ICM_PAGE_SIZE == 0` before performing the division. If the value is invalid, return an appropriate error code (e.g., `-EINVAL`).

Suggested fix:
```c
if (MTHCA_ICM_PAGE_SIZE == 0)
    return -EINVAL;

*aux_pages = ALIGN(*aux_pages, PAGE_SIZE / MTHCA_ICM_PAGE_SIZE) >>
    (PAGE_SHIFT - MTHCA_ICM_PAGE_SHIFT);
```
