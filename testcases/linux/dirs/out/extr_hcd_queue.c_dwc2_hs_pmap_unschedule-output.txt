Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hcd_queue.c_dwc2_hs_pmap_unschedule.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Access to an out-of-bounds index in `qh->hs_transfers + index`, since there is no check on whether `index` is within bounds. If `index` exceeds the array size, this will result in undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds memory access  
Bug Reason: The function assumes the `index` parameter is valid and does not perform bounds checking on `qh->hs_transfers`. An invalid `index` could cause an out-of-bounds access, leading to memory corruption, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking logic for `index` before performing the array access. For example, verify `index` is within `[0, array_size)` where `array_size` represents the size of `qh->hs_transfers`. If `index` exceeds bounds, log an error or exit early.
