UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Array access `enable[n]` might access out of bounds if `n` is greater than or equal to the size of the `enable` array or if the `enable` array is uninitialized. Using such out-of-bounds indices results in undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: The `enable` array is accessed using the `n` parameter, but no bounds checking or initialization of the `enable` array is performed. If `n` exceeds the array's bounds or if `enable` is uninitialized, this will lead to incorrect program behavior, access violations, or crashes.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Verify that the `enable` array is correctly initialized and that the value of `n` falls within the valid index range of the array. Add a bounds check like the following before accessing the array:
```c
if (n >= ARRAY_SIZE(enable)) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return an error code for invalid `n`
}
```
