UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `name` array has a fixed size of `MAX_NAME_LEN + 3`, but `len > MAX_NAME_LEN + 2` is checked after reading data into it. If `local->func->get_rid` function writes more data than `MAX_NAME_LEN + 2` into `name`, this causes buffer overflow and undefined behavior as the array `name` could be overwritten outside its bounds.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The function does not ensure `local->func->get_rid` writes only up to `MAX_NAME_LEN + 2` bytes into `name`. If `len` returned from `get_rid` exceeds the length of the `name` buffer (`MAX_NAME_LEN + 3`), it corrupts memory beyond the buffer boundary before the condition `len > MAX_NAME_LEN + 2` is checked.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Update the function to enforce a maximum limit when calling `get_rid`, ensuring it does not write beyond the allocated buffer. For example:
```c
if (len > MAX_NAME_LEN + 2 || len < 0 || val > MAX_NAME_LEN || len > sizeof(name)) {
    return -EOPNOTSUPP;
}
```  
Additionally, consider adding bounds checks within `get_rid` itself as part of its implementation to avoid overwriting buffers inadvertently.
