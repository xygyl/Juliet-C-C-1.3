UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Possible undefined behavior due to signed integer overflow in `dt->tm_year % 100`. Since `dt->tm_year` is of type `int` (signed), if its value is negative, `%` may result in undefined behavior because signed integer modulo is implementation-defined or undefined when the dividend is negative.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Bug
Bug Reason: Incorrect handling of `tm_year` may lead to incorrect calculations or potential issues. For example, negative `tm_year` will not correctly map to the range [0, 99].
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Explicitly cast `dt->tm_year` to unsigned before performing modulo operation if negative values are possible, or restrict `dt->tm_year` to valid positive values beforehand:
```c
dt->tm_year = (unsigned int) dt->tm_year % 100;
```
