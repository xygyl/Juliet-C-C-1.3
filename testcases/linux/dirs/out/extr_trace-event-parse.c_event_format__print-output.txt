Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_trace-event-parse.c_event_format__print.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The return type of `event_format__print` is defined as `void`, but it contains a `return` statement that attempts to return a value. Returning a value from a `void` function constitutes undefined behavior as per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The `return` statement in the function attempting to return a value is incompatible with the `void` return type. It will cause a compilation error or unpredictable behavior in implementations that do not warn or error out during compilation.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Remove the `return` statement entirely from `event_format__print`. Since the return type is `void`, the function should not return any value. Update the code as follows:
```c
void event_format__print(struct tep_event *event,
                         int cpu, void *data, int size)
{
    event_format__fprintf(event, cpu, data, size, stdout);
}
```
```
