UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The pointer arithmetic `(header + 1)` and subsequent operations assume `header` is a valid pointer. If `header` is null or invalid, dereferencing it can trigger undefined behavior. Additionally, potential pointer arithmetic issue exists with `(void *)(header + 1)` as it skips to memory without ensuring alignment; this could result in misaligned memory access, which is UB on architectures that require strict alignment.
 
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not verify the validity of the `header` pointer before performing pointer arithmetic operations and dereferencing it. If `header` is null, `(header + 1)` will dereference an invalid/null pointer.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `header` before proceeding with pointer arithmetic or dereferencing. For example:
```c
if (!header)
    return ERR_PTR(-EINVAL);
```
