UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The use of `%pa` in `pr_err` assumes an argument of type `resource_size_t*`, but the `size` and `range->size` arguments are scalar variables, not pointers. This results in undefined behavior as format specifiers must match the type of the respective argument.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The improper use of the `%pa` format specifier, which is intended for printing physical addresses (i.e., formatted as `resource_size_t*`), attempts to interpret scalar values (`size` and `range->size`) as pointers. This can lead to incorrect logging and diagnostic information. Furthermore, the current code risks dereferencing invalid memory addresses depending on compiler behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Use the `%llx` format specifier instead of `%pa`, as `resource_size_t` typically maps to an integer type like `unsigned long long`. The corrected lines should look like this:  
```c
pr_err("resource size %llx cannot fit in IO range size %llx\n", size, range->size);
```
```
