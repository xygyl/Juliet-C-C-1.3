Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vpdma_priv.h_dtd_max_width_height.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `max_width` variable is an `int`, which is signed, and shifting a negative signed integer results in undefined behavior as per the C standard. Signed-left shifts with values that result in overflow are expressly undefined. Additionally, if the shift count (`DTD_MAX_WIDTH_SHFT`) exceeds or equals the number of bits in `max_width`, behavior is undefined.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function assumes `max_width` and `max_height` to be positive and does not validate them. Using negative values may lead to undefined behavior due to signed left shifts or incorrect logic (flaws in bitwise operations). Additionally, the result could become non-sensical if not properly constrained.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Consider changing `max_width` and `max_height` to unsigned integers (`unsigned int`) to eliminate the risk of undefined behavior from signed left shifts. Alternatively, validate inputs to ensure they are non-negative and within acceptable bounds before performing the bitwise operations. Example:

```c
static inline u32 dtd_max_width_height(unsigned int max_width, unsigned int max_height)
{
	return (max_width << DTD_MAX_WIDTH_SHFT) | max_height;
}
```
