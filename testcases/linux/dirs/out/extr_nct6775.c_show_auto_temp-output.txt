Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nct6775.c_show_auto_temp.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds access in `data->auto_temp[nr][point]`. The bounds of `nr` and `point` are not validated before accessing the array.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Array index out-of-bounds
Bug Reason: Without validation of `nr` and `point`, indexing `data->auto_temp` could result in accessing invalid memory if they are out-of-bounds for the `auto_temp` array dimensions. This can cause crashes or undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate `nr` and `point` against the actual dimensions of `data->auto_temp` before accessing the array. For example:

```c
if (nr < 0 || nr >= MAX_NR || point < 0 || point >= MAX_POINT) {
    return -EINVAL; // or other appropriate error handling
}
```

Where `MAX_NR` and `MAX_POINT` represent the actual array bounds determined by the implementation. These constants should be properly defined or derived if not explicitly provided in the code.
