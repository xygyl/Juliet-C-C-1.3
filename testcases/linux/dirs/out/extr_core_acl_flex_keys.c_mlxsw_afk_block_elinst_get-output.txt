UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences `elinst->info->element` without verifying if `elinst->info` is non-NULL, potentially leading to undefined behavior if `info` is NULL. Additionally, if `block->instances` is NULL or `block->instances_count` is not correctly set, `block->instances[i]` could lead to out-of-bounds memory access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `elinst->info` is NULL, accessing `elinst->info->element` results in a null pointer dereference which is both undefined behavior and a bug.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before accessing `elinst->info->element`, add a check to ensure `elinst->info` is non-NULL. For example:
```c
if (elinst->info && elinst->info->element == element)
```
Additionally, ensure `block->instances` is non-NULL and `block->instances_count` is properly validated before entering the loop over `block->instances_count`.
