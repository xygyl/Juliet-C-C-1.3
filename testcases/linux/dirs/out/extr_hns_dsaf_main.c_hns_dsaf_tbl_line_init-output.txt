UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function accesses the array `tbl_line` without verifying its size or if its index (potentially out of bounds) falls within valid range. The implicit usage of `tbl_line[0]` without validation could lead to undefined behavior if the assumption about its index is violated.
Bug Detected: Yes
