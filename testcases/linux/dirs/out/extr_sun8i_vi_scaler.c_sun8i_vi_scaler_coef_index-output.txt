UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The parameter `step` is shifted right by `SUN8I_VI_SCALER_SCALE_FRAC - 3`. If `SUN8I_VI_SCALER_SCALE_FRAC` is less than 3, this will result in a negative shift amount, which triggers undefined behavior in C. The standard mandates that shifting by a negative value is undefined behavior. Additionally, shifts larger than the bit-width of the integer type are also undefined.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The logic of shifting `step` by `SUN8I_VI_SCALER_SCALE_FRAC - 3` assumes that `SUN8I_VI_SCALER_SCALE_FRAC` is sufficiently large. If this assumption is violated or `SUN8I_VI_SCALER_SCALE_FRAC` has a value such that its subtraction causes a negative shift count, the function will not work as intended and may lead to incorrect results. Additionally, the fallback values when `default:` is executed make assumptions about the range of values for `int_part` which may not be safeguarded elsewhere.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `SUN8I_VI_SCALER_SCALE_FRAC - 3` is checked at compile time (e.g., via a `#if` guard or `static_assert`) to ensure it's non-negative and less than the bit-width of `unsigned int`. Add validation for the input parameter `step` to ensure it is within a reasonable range.
