Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_gemi915_gem_object.h_i915_gem_object_lock.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: This function performs `dma_resv_lock(obj->base.resv, NULL)` without verifying that `obj` is not `NULL`. If `obj` is `NULL`, dereferencing `obj->base.resv` will invoke undefined behavior, as it attempts to access a member of a null pointer.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that the `obj` pointer passed into `i915_gem_object_lock` is always valid, but this assumption is not checked. If `obj` is `NULL`, a null pointer dereference occurs at `obj->base.resv`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a conditional check to ensure that `obj` is not `NULL`:  
```c
static inline void i915_gem_object_lock(struct drm_i915_gem_object *obj)
{
    if (!obj)
        return; // Or handle the error appropriately
    dma_resv_lock(obj->base.resv, NULL);
}
```
