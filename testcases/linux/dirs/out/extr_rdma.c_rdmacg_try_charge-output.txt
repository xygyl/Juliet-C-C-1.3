UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow is possible when calculating `new = rpool->resources[index].usage + 1`. If `usage` is close to the maximum value representable by `s64`, adding 1 can cause overflow. Signed integer overflow results in undefined behavior in C.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer overflow, Logic bug
Bug Reason: If `usage` exceeds the maximum value of `s64` due to addition, it will result in undefined behavior (UB). Additionally, incorrect resource accounting may occur, leading to potential resource exhaustion or mismanagement within the system.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Replace the addition (`new = rpool->resources[index].usage + 1`) with a check against `S64_MAX` before performing the operation. Alternatively, convert `usage` to an unsigned type, as unsigned overflow is well-defined in C (modulo arithmetic).

Example fix:
```c
if (rpool->resources[index].usage == S64_MAX) {
    ret = -EAGAIN; // Cannot allocate more
    goto err;
} else {
    new = rpool->resources[index].usage + 1;
}
```
