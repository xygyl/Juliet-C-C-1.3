Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_frpw.c_frpw_write_regr.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses the `cont_map` array using `cont_map[cont]` without checking if the index `cont` is within bounds of the array. If `cont` exceeds the size of `cont_map` or is negative, this would result in undefined behavior due to an out-of-bounds array access.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The lack of bounds checking on `cont_map[cont]` can lead to out-of-bounds memory access, which can corrupt memory or crash the program. Additionally, the variable `r` is derived from `cont_map[cont]`, so subsequent usage of `r` relies on potentially invalid data.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before accessing `cont_map[cont]`, add a check to ensure `cont` is non-negative and within the bounds of the `cont_map` array, such as:  
```c  
if (cont < 0 || cont >= ARRAY_SIZE(cont_map)) {  
    // Handle error: invalid index  
    return;  
}  
```  
Ensure `ARRAY_SIZE(cont_map)` is defined to return the size of the array `cont_map`.
