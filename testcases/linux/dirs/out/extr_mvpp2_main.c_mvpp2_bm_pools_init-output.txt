Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mvpp2_main.c_mvpp2_bm_pools_init.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function may access out-of-bounds memory if `poolnum` exceeds `MVPP2_BM_POOLS_NUM` due to `priv->percpu_pools` being non-zero but `priv->bm_pools` not properly sized. This can lead to undefined behavior when accessing `priv->bm_pools[i]`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: As described in the UB analysis, if `poolnum` exceeds the size of the `bm_pools` array, subsequent loop iterations might dereference out-of-bounds memory, potentially causing memory corruption or crashes depending on the context.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to ensure that `poolnum` calculated from `mvpp2_get_nrxqs(priv) * 2` does not exceed the size of `priv->bm_pools`. For example, limit `poolnum` to `MVPP2_BM_POOLS_NUM` or ensure the allocation of `priv->bm_pools` can accommodate the calculated `poolnum` value.
