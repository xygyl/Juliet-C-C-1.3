UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Access to `info` without null pointer validation could lead to undefined behavior if the pointer is null. Dereferencing `info->regmap` or `info->base` would cause UB in such a scenario.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function dereferences the `info` pointer and its members (`info->regmap` and `info->base`) without checking if `info` is a null pointer. If the caller passes a null pointer, the program will crash or behave unpredictably.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer validation at the start of the function:
```c
if (!info)
    return -EINVAL; // Return a meaningful error code if `info` is null.
```
