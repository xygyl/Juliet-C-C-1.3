UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potentially dereferencing a null pointer (`arr`). The function does not validate if `arr` is non-null before accessing `arr[idx]`. If `arr` is passed as `NULL`, accessing `arr[idx]` results in undefined behavior, as defined by the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function lacks validation for the `arr` pointer before dereferencing it. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if `arr` is passed as `NULL`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for the `arr` parameter at the start of the function. Example:  

```c
if (arr == NULL)
    return false;
```
With this fix, the function ensures memory safety by avoiding operations on invalid pointers.
