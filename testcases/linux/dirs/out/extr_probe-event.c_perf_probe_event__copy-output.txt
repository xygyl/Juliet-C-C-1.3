Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_probe-event.c_perf_probe_event__copy.c

UB Detected: No
UB Reason: No undefined behavior patterns are evident in the code. The function safeguards against null memory allocation checks (`!dst->args`) and properly uses other helper functions such as `perf_probe_point__copy` and `perf_probe_arg__copy`. Memory allocations and string duplication appear to have been managed safely using custom wrapper functions.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Leak
Bug Reason: If an error occurs during the argument copy loop (`perf_probe_arg__copy`) or earlier in the function, memory allocated for `dst->args` will not be freed, potentially resulting in a memory leak. While `clear_perf_probe_event` is called at the error label, it is unclear whether this function frees `dst->args` or other dynamically allocated resources. Without its implementation, it cannot be definitively determined that cleanup is properly done.

Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the `clear_perf_probe_event` function safely and fully deallocates all dynamically allocated resources, including `dst->args`. Alternatively, add explicit `free(dst->args)` to the error handling path to prevent memory leaks.
