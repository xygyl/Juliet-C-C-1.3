UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible out-of-bounds array access in loops that store source_caps and sink_caps. The function does not validate the array bounds (`port->source_caps` and `port->sink_caps`), leading to undefined behavior if the value of `cnt` exceeds the allocated capacity for these arrays. Additionally, no checks are implemented to ensure that `port->source_caps` and `port->sink_caps` arrays are properly initialized before use.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The loop accesses elements of `port->source_caps` or `port->sink_caps` up to `cnt` indices, but there is no guarantee that the arrays are sized to handle `cnt` elements safely. This causes a potential memory corruption and/or undefined behavior if `cnt` is larger than the allocated size.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking to ensure `cnt` does not exceed the size of the `source_caps` and `sink_caps` arrays. For example:  

```c
for (i = 0; i < cnt && i < ARRAY_SIZE(port->source_caps); i++) {
    port->source_caps[i] = le32_to_cpu(msg->payload[i]);
}
```  

Similarly, apply bounds checking for `sink_caps`. If the array sizes are unknown, dynamically allocate space based on `cnt` and handle memory allocation errors.
