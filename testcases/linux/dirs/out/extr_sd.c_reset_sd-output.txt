### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:
1. **Violation of strict aliasing rules:** The `rsp` array is passed as a `u8*` to various functions, such as `sd_send_cmd_get_rsp`, which might manipulate it in a way that assumes specific alignment or aliasing. If the function dereferences or reinterprets the data incorrectly, strict aliasing rules can be violated.  
2. **Potential access to uninitialized memory:** The `rsp` array is declared but not explicitly initialized before use in functions such as `sd_send_cmd_get_rsp`. If this array is accessed before being fully populated, it leads to undefined behavior due to reading uninitialized variables.  
3. **Integer overflow during `voltage` calculation:** The expression `voltage = SUPPORT_VOLTAGE | 0x40000000;` assumes that `SUPPORT_VOLTAGE` fits within a 32-bit unsigned integer. If `SUPPORT_VOLTAGE` contains higher values (e.g., as a macro error or programming mistake), this operation can result in an undefined overflow.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, Initialization issue  
Bug Reason: 
1. **Uninitialized Array Access:** The creation and population of the `rsp` array is prone to uninitialized usage between calls to functions. It can cause incorrect data handling.  
2. **Logic flaws in retries:** The retry mechanism for functions like `sd_send_cmd_get_rsp` (inside retries like `RTY_SD_RST`) may lead to infinite loops or premature exits in edge cases, failing to ensure the card initialization process is fully completed.  
3. **Error-recovery ambiguity:** The state recovery after failures or retries (`goto switch_fail`) does not robustly clean up intermediate states, potentially leaving the card or chip in an inconsistent state.

Bug Caused by UB: Partially  
Confidence: Medium  

### Fix Suggestion
1. **Initialize `rsp` array before use:** Ensure `rsp` is explicitly cleared (e.g., `memset(rsp, 0, sizeof(rsp));`) before each invocation of functions that use it.  
2. **Avoid strict aliasing violations:** Ensure all operations on `rsp` respect aliasing rules; document or refactor the usage pattern of related functions.  
3. **Robust retry mechanisms:** Introduce better failure detection and handling mechanisms in retries (e.g., adding an additional reason tracker or timeout mechanism).  
4. **Verify ranges and overflow handling:** Ensure all variables, such as `voltage` and retries, perform bounds checking to avoid integer overflow.
