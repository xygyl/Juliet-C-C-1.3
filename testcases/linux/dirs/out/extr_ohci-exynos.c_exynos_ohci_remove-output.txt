Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_ohci-exynos.c_exynos_ohci_remove.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The line `pdev->dev.of_node = exynos_ohci->of_node;` writes a value to `pdev->dev.of_node`, a part of the `platform_device` passed into the function. This could violate the constraints of the device's registration and initialization code, depending on whether this node is expected to remain constant. Writing into `pdev->dev.of_node`, which might be handled by device tree internals, can lead to undefined behavior in the kernel environment.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: Setting `pdev->dev.of_node` may unintentionally modify the behavior of other code relying on this field elsewhere. `of_node` is typically set during device initialization and remains unchanged during runtime, suggesting this modification is inappropriate or unintended.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Avoid modifying `pdev->dev.of_node`. If the `platform_device` needs access to `exynos_ohci->of_node`, consider using a local variable or alternative approach that does not overwrite the existing device tree node reference.
