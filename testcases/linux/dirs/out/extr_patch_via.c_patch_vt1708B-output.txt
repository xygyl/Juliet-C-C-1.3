UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function operates within the bounds of the C standard. There is no signed integer overflow, null/invalid pointer dereference, uninitialized variable usage, or other operations defined as undefined behavior by the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Leak
Bug Reason: If `via_new_spec(codec)` returns a valid pointer (i.e., `spec != NULL`) but an error occurs during `via_parse_auto_config(codec)`, the code jumps to the `error:` label without deallocating the memory allocated by `via_new_spec(codec)`. This results in a memory leak.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a call to free (or equivalent deallocation routine) the memory allocated for `spec` inside the `error:` block. For example:
```c
error:
    via_free(codec);
    if (spec)
        free(spec);  // Ensure proper deallocation of memory
    return err;
```
Alternatively, modify `via_free(codec)`—if applicable—to free this resource as part of the codec cleanup process.
