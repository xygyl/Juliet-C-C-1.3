UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential out‐of‐bounds memory access when dereferencing `qs[i]` in the `dev_err` statement, as `i` may exceed `q_num - 1`. If `qs[i]` is accessed after `i` increments past `q_num`, this results in undefined behavior due to accessing memory outside the array boundary.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The function does not adequately ensure that the `i` index remains within the bounds of the `qs` array during the error reporting phase. If the while condition (`wait_cnt >= 10000`) breaks the loop before `i` matches `q_num`, the `dev_err` invocation will access `qs[i]` out of bounds, leading to illegal memory access.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a conditional check before accessing `qs[i]` inside the `dev_err` statement to ensure `i < q_num`, or refactor the error reporting mechanism to handle cases where `i >= q_num` due to a premature exit from the loop. For example:
```c
if (i < q_num)
    dev_err(qs[i]->handle->owner_dev, "queue(%d) wait fbd(%d) clean fail!!\n", i, fbd_num);
else
    dev_err(NULL, "queue index out of bounds during failure reporting.\n");
```
