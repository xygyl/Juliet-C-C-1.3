UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `clamp_val()` invocations sometimes perform arithmetic operations on the `scalar_t__` type (which appears to be signed long). If `scalar_t__ t.udma`, `t.recover`, `t.active`, `t.rec8b`, or `t.act8b` holds values resulting in signed integer overflow (e.g., exceeding the range of a signed type during subtraction in `clamp_val(t.udma, 2, 9) - 2`), it causes undefined behavior in C. Furthermore, clamp boundaries are usually at "1", but their actual mathematical values upon clamping are unstated.
