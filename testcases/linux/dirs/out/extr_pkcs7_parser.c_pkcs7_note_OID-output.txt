UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The subtraction `(unsigned long)value - ctx->data` assumes that `value` and `ctx->data` are pointers that point to the same object or array. If `value` (casted to `unsigned long`) and `ctx->data` belong to separate allocations or are otherwise unrelated, this operation violates the C standard and causes undefined behavior. Pointer arithmetic is only defined for pointers within the same object/array domain. Additionally, `ctx->data` and `value` should explicitly be cast to types compatible with the operation to ensure correct pointer arithmetic interpretation.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The subtraction `(unsigned long)value - ctx->data` is conceptually incorrect if `ctx->data` and `value` are unrelated pointers. Moreover, casting `value` to `unsigned long` may cause loss of information on certain platforms if the size of `uintptr_t` and `unsigned long` differ. This can lead to a misleading or incorrect output in the `printk` statement. Handling memory alignment and pointer arithmetic improperly can also produce erroneous results.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
Ensure that pointer arithmetic is performed only within the same object or array. Use `uintptr_t` for operations involving pointer value subtraction instead of `unsigned long`, as this ensures proper handling across platforms. For example:  
```c
printk("PKCS7: Unknown OID: [%lu] %s\n",
       (uintptr_t)value - (uintptr_t)ctx->data, buffer);
```  
Additionally, verify that `ctx->data` and `value` are guaranteed to be part of the same allocation or memory region before performing the subtraction operation.
