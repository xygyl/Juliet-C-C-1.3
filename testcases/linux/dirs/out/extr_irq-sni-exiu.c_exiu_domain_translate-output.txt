UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses `fwspec->param[2]` without verifying that `param_count >= 3` in the branch for `!is_of_node(fwspec->fwnode)`. This leads to undefined behavior when `param_count < 3` since accessing out-of-bounds elements in an array is undefined behavior in C.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory access bug  
Bug Reason: Accessing an out-of-bounds index in the `param` array when `param_count < 3` during the else branch of the condition may lead to a segmentation fault or unpredictable behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a condition to verify that `param_count >= 3` before accessing `fwspec->param[2]` in the else branch. Alternatively, the logic should ensure safe fallback behavior when `param_count` is less than expected.
