UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses `snprintf()` in a manner that could potentially result in accessing memory out of bounds. Specifically, `len += snprintf(&buf[len], PAGE_SIZE - len, ...)` could increment `len` such that subsequent calls attempt to write beyond `PAGE_SIZE` buffers, violating argument constraints to `snprintf()`.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The loop does not properly account for situations where `PAGE_SIZE` could be exceeded when writing data to `buf`. While each call to `snprintf()` claims to respect `PAGE_SIZE - len`, the logic does not ensure the buffer pointer boundary constraints are enforced across iterations.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit checks for `len` during iteration to ensure `len` stays within bounds at all times. Modify the usage of `ARRAY_SIZE(cabc_modes)` and adjust conditional logic to prevent buffer overflow behavior. For example:

```c
for (i = 0, len = 0; len < PAGE_SIZE && i < ARRAY_SIZE(cabc_modes); i++) {
    int written = snprintf(&buf[len], PAGE_SIZE - len, "%s%s%s",
        i ? " " : "", cabc_modes[i],
        i == ARRAY_SIZE(cabc_modes) - 1 ? "\n" : "");

    if (written >= PAGE_SIZE - len) {
        len = PAGE_SIZE - 1; // Prevent overflow
        break;
    }

    len += written;
}
```
Ensure you further verify that `PAGE_SIZE` accurately reflects the buffer's actual boundaries to avoid issues with macro definitions.
