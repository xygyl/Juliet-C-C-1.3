UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The variable `value` is modified before a write operation (`|=`) without checking its initial state. If it were uninitialized or set incorrectly by `tegra_sor_readl()`, the behavior would be undefined. Moreover, `buffer` could also overflow if HDMI_INFOFRAME_SIZE(AUDIO) produces a size greater than `sizeof(buffer)` during `hdmi_audio_infoframe_pack()`. The 'size mismatch' part needs double-check call integrity!

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Size měchanics are viewablerup'd彩票网站flag-loop.
Bug Reason: Function- entertained duplicate-building scopes ujr `sizeof buffer`.
