Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vdec_helpers.c_dst_buf_done.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential integer division by zero when calculating `bytesused` values for the planes. If `output_size` returned by `amvdec_get_output_size(sess)` is zero, dividing it by 2 or by 4 will result in undefined behavior. The C standard does not define behavior for integer division by zero, leading to UB.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw and undefined behavior-induced bug
Bug Reason: The function does not verify whether `output_size` is valid (non-zero) before performing operations such as division. This can result in an error when processing buffers, potentially leading to corrupted data or crashes. Additionally, the field `bytesused` for each plane might not be correctly initialized if `output_size` is zero, propagating invalid data downstream. 
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Check the value of `output_size` before performing divisions or assigning it to `bytesused`. For example:
```c
if (output_size == 0) {
    dev_dbg(dev, "Error: output size is zero, cannot process buffer\n");
    return;
}
vbuf->vb2_buf.planes[0].bytesused = output_size;
```

This ensures that divisions are only executed when `output_size` is valid.
