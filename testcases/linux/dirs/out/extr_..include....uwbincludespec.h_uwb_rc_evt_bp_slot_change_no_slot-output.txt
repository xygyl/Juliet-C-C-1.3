UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential dereference of null pointer `evt`. There is no null-pointer check for `evt` before accessing `evt->slot_info`. If `uwb_rc_evt_bp_slot_change_no_slot` is ever called with a null pointer, the behavior is undefined.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function could dereference a null pointer passed as the `evt` argument, causing undefined behavior and potential program crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null-pointer check at the beginning of the function to ensure `evt` is not null:
```c
if (evt == NULL) {
    return -1; // or another value indicating an error
}
```
