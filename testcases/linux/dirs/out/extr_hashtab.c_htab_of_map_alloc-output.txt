Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hashtab.c_htab_of_map_alloc.c  
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function avoids undefined behavior as all pointer dereferencing is protected by proper checks (e.g., `IS_ERR()` ensures that invalid pointers are not dereferenced). Additionally, NULL pointer usage is defined (`#define NULL ((void*)0)`). There is no evidence of signed integer overflow, misaligned access, or other common UB scenarios.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Leak  
Bug Reason: If `htab_map_alloc(attr)` fails (`IS_ERR(map)` evaluates to true), the function frees `inner_map_meta` using `bpf_map_meta_free(inner_map_meta)` but does not explicitly mark `map->inner_map_meta` as freed (or NULL) before returning. If the caller attempts to use `map->inner_map_meta`, it may lead to unintended behavior or double-free errors later on, depending on the callerâ€™s logic. Additionally, `inner_map_meta` remains allocated in the caller's context after returning the error code. The absence of cleanup logic for the allocated map object may result in a memory leak.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Before returning in case of failure, ensure that all allocated resources, including `map->inner_map_meta`, are properly cleaned up and marked as free or NULL. For example:  

```c
if (IS_ERR(map)) {
    bpf_map_meta_free(inner_map_meta);
    return map; // Ensure a consistent error handle process.
