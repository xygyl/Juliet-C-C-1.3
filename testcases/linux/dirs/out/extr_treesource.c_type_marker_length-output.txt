### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `type_marker_length` dereferences `next` and accesses `next->offset` without confirming that `next` is non-NULL. If `next` is NULL (possibly returned by `next_type_marker`), this results in undefined behavior due to dereferencing a NULL pointer.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The dereferencing of `next->offset` can lead to a null pointer dereference when `next_type_marker` returns NULL. The code will attempt to access memory at location 0, which causes a crash or undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
Add a guard condition to explicitly check whether `next` is NULL before accessing `next->offset`. The corrected function could look like this:
```c
size_t type_marker_length(struct marker *m)
{
    struct marker *next = next_type_marker(m->next);

    if (next)
        return next->offset - m->offset;
    else
        return 0;  // Ensure proper handling when 'next' is NULL
}
```
