Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hal_btcoex.c_EXhalbtcoutsrc_DisplayBtCoexInfo.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not check if the `pBtCoexist` pointer is `NULL` before dereferencing it (e.g., accessing `pBtCoexist->boardInfo.btdmAntNum`). This can lead to undefined behavior if the function is called with a `NULL` pointer.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: The `pBtCoexist` pointer is used without verifying whether it is a valid, non-`NULL` pointer. If this pointer is `NULL`, the attempt to dereference it (`pBtCoexist->boardInfo.btdmAntNum`) will cause a runtime crash or undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for `NULL` at the beginning of the function, such as:
```c
if (pBtCoexist == NULL)
    return;
```
Alternatively, ensure that `halbtcoutsrc_IsBtCoexistAvailable()` internally handles the `NULL` check for `pBtCoexist`. If it already does, document this behavior clearly. However, from the current code, this assumption cannot be made.
