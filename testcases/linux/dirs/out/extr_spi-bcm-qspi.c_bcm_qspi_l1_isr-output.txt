UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: This function does not contain any obvious undefined behavior. All pointer dereferences (e.g., `soc_intc`) are gated by null checks. Additionally, no operations such as signed integer overflow or out‐of‐bounds memory access are evident in the code.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: If `soc_intc` is null, the function silently returns `IRQ_NONE` without raising any flags. Depending on the implementation context, this might suppress interrupt handling altogether and could lead to potential misbehavior in the system. This could be considered a passive bug rather than an outright fault but still warrants attention.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Introduce error handling for the case when `soc_intc` is null to ensure proper reporting or corrective actions. For example:  

```c
if (soc_intc == NULL) {
    log_error("Interrupt controller not initialized");
    return IRQ_NONE;
}
```
