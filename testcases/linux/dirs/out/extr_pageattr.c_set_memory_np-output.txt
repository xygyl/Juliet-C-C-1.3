Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pageattr.c_set_memory_np.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `&addr` is passed as a pointer to a function (`change_page_attr_clear`), but `addr`, being a local variable, will go out of scope after the call. This can lead to undefined behavior if the function dereferences this pointer at a later time.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: Invalid use of address-of operator (`&addr`) for local variable. If `addr` is required to be persistently referenced, it should be allocated in a persistent memory area like the heap, or its value should be passed directly instead of its pointer.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Consider passing `addr` as an unsigned long directly into `change_page_attr_clear` instead of `&addr`. If a pointer is required by the API, you could allocate `addr` dynamically (e.g., on the heap) and free it immediately after the function call.
