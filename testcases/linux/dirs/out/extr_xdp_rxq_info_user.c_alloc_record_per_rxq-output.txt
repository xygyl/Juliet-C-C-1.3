Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_xdp_rxq_info_user.c_alloc_record_per_rxq.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Dereferencing a null pointer most likely happens when calling `memset` on `array` if `malloc` fails to allocate memory. This violates the C standard as dereferencing null pointers leads to undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The function calls `memset` immediately after `malloc`, without checking whether `malloc` returned `NULL`. This could result in a crash if memory allocation fails. Although `exit` is later called on allocation failure, the program might crash before reaching the error handling portion.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate whether `array` is `NULL` immediately after the `malloc` call and ensure the error handling logic is executed before performing operations like `memset`. For example:

```c
array = malloc(size);
if (!array) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Mem alloc error (nr_rxqs:%u)\n", nr_rxqs);
    exit(EXIT_FAIL_MEM);
}
memset(array, 0, size);
```
