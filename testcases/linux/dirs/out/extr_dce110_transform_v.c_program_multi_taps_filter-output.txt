UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing array element `coeffs[array_idx + 1]` without verifying `array_idx + 1` is within bounds causes undefined behavior if `array_idx + 1 >= taps_pairs`. This can occur when the input parameters are malformed or if `coeffs` is of insufficient size. Additionally, there is a potential for signed integer overflow in calculations involving `taps_pairs` or `array_idx` depending on their usage.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the size of the `coeffs` array against the expected number of elements derived from `taps_pairs` and `phases_to_program`. This results in the potential for out-of-bounds memory access.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking for the `coeffs` array before accessing its elements. Ensure `array_idx` does not exceed the size of the `coeffs` array. Additionally, confirm the value of `taps_pairs` and `phases_to_program` are safe to use in all contexts and do not lead to integer overflow.  

Example fix:
```c
if (array_idx + 1 >= expected_coeffs_size) { // expected_coeffs_size should be derived based on `taps` and `phases_to_program`.
    // Handle error: Log, return, or stop execution
    return;
}
```
