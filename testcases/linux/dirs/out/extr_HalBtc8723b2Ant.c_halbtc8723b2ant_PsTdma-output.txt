UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `pCoexDm` pointer is dereferenced directly without any prior validation (e.g., checking for `NULL`). If `pCoexDm` is `NULL` or contains an invalid address, dereferencing it will result in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference (Potential)  
Bug Reason: If `pCoexDm` is `NULL`, the code would crash due to dereferencing it in multiple locations, such as `pCoexDm->bCurPsTdmaOn`. Since there is no check ensuring `pCoexDm` is valid, this could lead to runtime errors if an invalid pointer is passed.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a `NULL` check for the `pCoexDm` pointer at the beginning of the function. For example:
```c
if (!pCoexDm) {
    BTC_PRINT(BTC_MSG_ALGORITHM, ALGO_TRACE_FW, "[BTCoex] Null pCoexDm pointer passed!\n");
    return;
}
```  

This will prevent the function from operating on an invalid pointer and ensure proper functionality in all cases.
