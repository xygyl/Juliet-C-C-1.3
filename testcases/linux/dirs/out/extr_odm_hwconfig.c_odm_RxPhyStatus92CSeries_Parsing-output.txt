UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: 
1. Potential out-of-bounds access on `pPhyStaRpt->path_rxsnr[i]` due to invalid indexing (`i < RF_PATH_MAX`) without verifying `RF_PATH_MAX` against the size of `path_rxsnr`. If `RF_PATH_MAX` exceeds the number of elements in `path_rxsnr`, this is undefined behavior.
2. Signed integer overflow may occur when performing arithmetic on `rx_pwr[i]` or `rx_pwr_all` due to the input ranges being manipulated with additions, subtractions, and multiplications potentially surpassing the limits of `s8` and other types involved.
3. Casts from `void*` to `s32` for `pPhyInfo->RxSNR[i]` assignment (using `path_rxsnr[i]/2`) may lead to undefined behavior if pointers are improperly managed or confused with integer arithmetic.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: The array `path_rxsnr` and similar arrays (`stream_rxevm`) are accessed within a loop indexed by `RF_PATH_A` to `RF_PATH_MAX`. If `RF_PATH_MAX` exceeds the size of these arrays, an out-of-bounds error is incurred. This could lead to crashes or data corruption.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion:
1. Verify that `RF_PATH_MAX` does not exceed the size of `path_rxsnr`, `stream_rxevm`, and other arrays potentially indexed by `RF_PATH_A` to `RF_PATH_MAX`.
   - Add array size checks prior to loop entry or implement bounds-checking in the loop iteration logic.
   
Example:
```c
if (RF_PATH_MAX > sizeof(pPhyStaRpt->path_rxsnr) / sizeof(pPhyStaRpt->path_rxsnr[0])) {
    RF_PATH_MAX = sizeof(pPhyStaRpt->path_rxsnr) / sizeof(pPhyStaRpt->path_rxsnr[0]);
}
```

2. Ensure integer arithmetic does not exceed type limits by explicitly checking if values surpass acceptable ranges prior to operations, or use wider integer types to store results safely when needed.

3. Double-check pointer usage and avoid casting pointers to arithmetic types unless absolutely necessary and guaranteed safe.
