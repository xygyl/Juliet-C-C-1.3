UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code explicitly modifies `avail` after the `min()` function call (i.e., `avail -= min(avail, part);`). If the value of `avail` was smaller than `part`, signed integer overflow does not occur here because `unsigned int` prevents signed overflow, but improper updates of `avail`, risks invalid behavior. Therefore impact arises when subtracting calculations that keep `total-calculated values unchecked`. there also form issues since global `
