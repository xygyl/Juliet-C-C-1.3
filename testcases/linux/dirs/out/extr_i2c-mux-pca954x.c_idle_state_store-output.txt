UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `data->last_chan` is a `scalar_t__` type (either arithmetic or pointer), and it is compared with `NULL` (or zero). If `scalar_t__` is a pointer type and `last_chan` holds a non-pointer value, this violates strict aliasing rules and causes undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw/Misinterpretation of data types.  
Bug Reason: Misuse of the `last_chan` variable, which is intended to represent a scalar value but is compared like a pointer (`last_chan || val != MUX_IDLE_DISCONNECT`). This logic could lead to incorrect behavior or inconsistent outcomes depending on `scalar_t__`'s underlying semantics.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `last_chan` is appropriately validated before use. If it is a pointer type, check for non-null values directly. If it is scalar and expected to hold numeric values, compare against numeric zero (`0`) instead of using pointer-like semantics.

Example Fix:
```c
if ((scalar_t__ last_chan != 0) || val != MUX_IDLE_DISCONNECT)
    ret = pca954x_deselect_mux(muxc, 0);
```
