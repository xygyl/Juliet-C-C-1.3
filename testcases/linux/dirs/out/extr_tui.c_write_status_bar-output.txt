Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_tui.c_write_status_bar.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `line` parameter is passed directly to `mvwprintw`, which expects a valid, non-null pointer. If `line` is NULL during execution, this will result in undefined behavior because `"%s"` will attempt to dereference a null pointer.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: Passing `NULL` as the `line` parameter will lead to a null pointer dereference in the `mvwprintw` function, potentially causing a crash or other erratic behavior. Thereâ€™s no explicit check to validate that `line` is non-null before using it.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion:
Add a check at the beginning of the `write_status_bar` function to verify that `line` is not `NULL`:
```c
void write_status_bar(int x, char *line)
{
    if (line == NULL) {
        return;  // Alternatively, you could log an error or handle this case explicitly.
    }
    mvwprintw(status_bar_window, 0, x, "%s", line);
    wrefresh(status_bar_window);
}
```
