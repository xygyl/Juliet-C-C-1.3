UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not invoke undefined behavior as per the C standard. All operations are on well-defined and assumed valid inputs. There is no out-of-bounds memory access, dereferencing of null pointers, or invalid use of data types. The shifting and bitwise operations are performed within appropriate bounds.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function assumes the `owner` variable to be either 0 or 1 without enforcing this constraint. If `owner` takes any value outside this range (e.g., 2, 3, etc.), it will improperly set bits and override adjacent controls in the `drp_control` variable. This could lead to unintended behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add an explicit check or mask to ensure `owner` is limited to expected values (0 or 1). Use `owner = !!owner;` before the bitwise operation or add an assertion `BUG_ON(owner != 0 && owner != 1);` as appropriate to validate the parameter.
