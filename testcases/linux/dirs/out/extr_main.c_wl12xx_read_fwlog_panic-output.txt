Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_main.c_wl12xx_read_fwlog_panic.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code uses the function `pm_runtime_put_noidle(wl->dev)` after a failed call to `pm_runtime_get_sync(wl->dev)`. If the runtime PM state machine is in an undefined or invalid state due to the error, invalid memory access or undefined behavior could occur when attempting to put the device into no-idle mode.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: If the call to `pm_runtime_get_sync(wl->dev)` fails (indicated by a negative return value), the error handling only performs `pm_runtime_put_noidle`. However, the error path does not account for the failure properly, which could lead to incorrect runtime PM state management or resource leakage. Additionally, there is no verification that `wlcore_event_fw_logger(wl)` actually operates effectively when the firmware might be unresponsive, or no stop-fwlog command was issued.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Improve error handling by verifying the status of the runtime PM state machine after a `pm_runtime_get_sync` failure. Avoid blindly calling `pm_runtime_put_noidle` if the device's state could be undefined. Additionally, add a mechanism to ensure proper functionality when `wlcore_event_fw_logger(wl)` fails to read the logger data.
