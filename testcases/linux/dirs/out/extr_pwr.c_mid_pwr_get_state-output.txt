UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `pwr->regs` is `NULL`, dereferencing it (`pwr->regs + offset`) is undefined behavior as the pointer would not point to a valid memory address.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `pwr->regs` is `NULL`, the function attempts to compute an offset based on a nonexistent base pointer, causing a fatal runtime error when attempting to read from an invalid memory address.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `pwr->regs` before performing math operations or dereferencing it. For example:
```c
if (!pwr || !pwr->regs) {
    return 0; // Or an appropriate error code
}
return readl(pwr->regs + PM_SSS(reg));
```
