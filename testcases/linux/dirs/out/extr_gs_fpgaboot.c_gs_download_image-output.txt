UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior due to reading out-of-bounds when `i + bus_bytes` exceeds `size` in the loop `for (i = 0; i < size; i += bus_bytes)` and dereferencing `bitdata + i`. Additionally, this assumes `fpgadata` (cast to `u8*`) is correctly initialized, but the potential for it being null or pointing to invalid memory exists, creating possible UB due to memory access violations.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The loop increments `i` by `bus_bytes`, but the memory access is unguarded and could read beyond the allocated bounds of `bitdata`. If `bus_bytes` does not evenly divide `size`, the loop may read one or more bytes beyond `size`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Introduce a boundary guard in the loop to ensure that `i + bus_bytes <= size` before accessing memory:  
```c
for (i = 0; i < size; i += bus_bytes) {
    if (i + bus_bytes > size) {
        pr_err("attempt to read beyond bitdata bounds\n");
        break;
    }
    xl_shift_bytes_out(bus_bytes, bitdata + i);
}
```
Also, validate `fpgadata` prior to use:
```c
if (fimage->fpgadata == NULL) {
    pr_err("fpgadata is NULL\n");
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
