UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function performs a calculation involving array index shifting (`p_src[0] << 8`, `p_src[1]`). However, it assumes the input `p_src` has sufficient valid memory, and violations occur if `length` is insufficient for `offset + block_size`, especially in accessing indices like `p_src` during the for-loop transaction.",

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The function risks accessing memory out of bounds when performing reads from the firmware array/pointer `p_src` without ensuring adequate bounds on `length`. The conditional check for `offset + block_size > length` occurs after accessing elements of `p_src`. Bounds validation should ideally occur before every pointer dereference involving `p_src`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure bounds validation is performed before every dereference of `p_src`, including where calculations like `p_src[0] << 8` and `p_src[offset + block_size]` occur. Add checks throughout the loop to ensure `p_src` accesses do not exceed permissible `length`. This would preemptively resolve the issue.
