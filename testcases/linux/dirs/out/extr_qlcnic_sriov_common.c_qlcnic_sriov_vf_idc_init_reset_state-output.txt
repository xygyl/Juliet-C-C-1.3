UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing `idc->prev_state` without validating if `idc` pointer is non-NULL can result in undefined behavior if `adapter->ahw` or `adapter->ahw->idc` is NULL. Dereferencing a NULL pointer constitutes UB per the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `adapter->ahw` and `adapter->ahw->idc` are valid, but does not explicitly check whether they are non-NULL before dereferencing them. This can lead to a crash if the pointer is invalid.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer checks for `adapter->ahw` and `adapter->ahw->idc` before dereferencing them. For example:  
```c  
if (!adapter->ahw || !adapter->ahw->idc) {  
    return -EINVAL;  
}  
```  
With this fix, the null pointer dereference issue is removed, ensuring safe pointer usage.
