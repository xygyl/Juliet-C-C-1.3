### **UB Analysis**
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not verify whether `new_stream` is `NULL`. If a NULL pointer is passed to `new_stream`, the `memcmp()` operation will attempt to dereference the NULL pointer, which results in undefined behavior.  

---

### **Bug Analysis**
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `new_stream` is a valid pointer without performing any checks. If `new_stream` is `NULL`, it leads to dereferencing a NULL pointer when accessing `new_stream->hdr_static_metadata`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

### **Confidence**
Confidence: High

### **Fix Suggestion**
Add a check to verify that `new_stream` is not `NULL` at the beginning of the function. For example:

```c
if (new_stream == NULL)
    return true;
```

This will ensure that pointers passed to the function are validated before usage, preventing undefined behavior and the associated bug.
