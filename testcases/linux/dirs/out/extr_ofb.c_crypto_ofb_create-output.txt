Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_ofb.c_crypto_ofb_create.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potentially dereferencing null pointers or accessing invalid instances. Specifically, if `skcipher_alloc_instance_simple()` or `crypto_mod_put(alg)` fails, further operations on the returned `inst` or `alg` may invoke undefined behavior. Also, `inst->free(inst)` is invoked without ensuring `inst` is properly initialized.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `skcipher_alloc_instance_simple()` returns an error (`IS_ERR(inst)` evaluates to true), but `inst->free(inst)` is still called due to improper error handling, this results in a null pointer dereference or use of invalid pointer. Additionally, improper handling of `crypto_mod_put(alg)` can lead to resource releases with possible side effects.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Implement stricter validity checks before invoking methods or dereferencing pointers. Specifically:
- Ensure `inst->free(inst)` is only called if `inst` is valid and initialized properly.
- Verify that calls to functions like `crypto_mod_put(alg)` have no adverse effects on subsequent operations involving `alg`.
