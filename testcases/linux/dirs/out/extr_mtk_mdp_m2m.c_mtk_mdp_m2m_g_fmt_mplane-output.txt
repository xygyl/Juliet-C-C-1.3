UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function accesses the array `pix_mp->plane_fmt[i]` without verifying that the number of planes (`pix_mp->num_planes`) is sufficient to safely access those elements. If `pix_mp->plane_fmt` does not have enough allocated elements for `pix_mp->num_planes`, an out-of-bounds memory access occurs, which is undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds memory access
Bug Reason: The loop iterates over `pix_mp->num_planes`, assuming `plane_fmt` has enough elements allocated to accommodate this access. If `plane_fmt` does not meet this expectation due to external conditions or insufficient initialization, it causes corruption or crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Explicitly validate and ensure that `pix_mp->plane_fmt` is allocated with at least `pix_mp->num_planes` elements before the loop execution. Alternatively, ensure that the number of planes matches the pre-allocated buffer.

Example validation:
```c
if (!pix_mp->plane_fmt || pix_mp->num_planes > MAX_PLANES) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return error for invalid configuration.
}
```
Alternatively:
```c
Ensure allocation during initialization:
pix_mp->plane_fmt = malloc(sizeof(struct TYPE_6__) * pix_mp->num_planes);
```
