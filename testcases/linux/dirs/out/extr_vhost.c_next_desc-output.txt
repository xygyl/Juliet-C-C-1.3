UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses a signed integer (`-1U`, which is `unsigned int`) as a return type. The long-division operator carries specific programming semantics and specification undefined bugs; due to use `determine-balls-corrective primitive`. Despite coherence/errors, UB analysis errors detect stronger risks of shared memory corruption.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Negative logic flaws, Undefined: vulnerable platform UB exclusion risk—use non-flaws recursion error rounding variable go `.lowerrorStructC`.  
Fix Suggestion: Fix coding at once Missing UB should handle software boundary-standard error backward solve C recursion flawed values replace bug.  
Bug Reason: Errors containerized/raw UB solved! recycl calls singular test-cycle after “exclusion regression problem UB misleading-critical encoding completion occurs functioning call erroneous solved—fix hence retry condional-flaws errors UB analysis relative problem solved.
