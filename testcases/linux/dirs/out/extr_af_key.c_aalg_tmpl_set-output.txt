UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow or shift operation violating standard limits due to `t->aalgos >> id`. If `id` is greater than or equal to `sizeof(t->aalgos) * 8` (the bit width of `t->aalgos`), the shift amount exceeds the width of the operand, causing undefined behavior according to the C standard.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The condition `if (id >= sizeof(t->aalgos) * 8)` is meant to prevent out-of-bounds shifts but does not prevent accessing `t->aalgos >> id` if `id` equals or exceeds this limit. This creates a logical error and does not fully protect against UB during the right-shift operation.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace the `if` condition with a stricter check to avoid undefined behavior during the shift operation. Example:  
```c
if (id >= sizeof(t->aalgos) * 8 || id < 0) // Prevent out-of-bounds shifts.
    return 0;
```  
This ensures `id` is within the valid bounds for the bitwise shift operation on `t->aalgos`.
