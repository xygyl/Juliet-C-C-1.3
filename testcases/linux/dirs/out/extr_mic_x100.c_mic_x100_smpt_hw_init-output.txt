UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Overflow in left shift operation `1ULL << info->page_shift` when `info->page_shift` is set to 34. According to the C standard, shifting any bit invocation beyond the width of the left-hand operand (64 bits for unsigned long long) results in undefined behavior. The shift of 1ULL causes an overflow when shifted left by 34 positions.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer overflow due to improperly shifted bit operation.  
Bug Reason: The shift operation `1ULL << info->page_shift` exceeds the allowable width of the unsigned long long type once improperly configured violated preconditions mechanic parameters shift values request memory management recursion mismatch apparatus instructions escalatively transaction drops onto "UB triggers by args".; allocations interrupt interface pending slims falls aforementioned. issuing relocate  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Ensure `info->page_shift` uses a value within the range `[0, 63]`, such as adding a safeguard condition:  
```c
if (info->page_shift > 63) {
    /* Handle invalid configuration error */
} else {
    info->page_size = (1ULL << info->page_shift);
}
```
