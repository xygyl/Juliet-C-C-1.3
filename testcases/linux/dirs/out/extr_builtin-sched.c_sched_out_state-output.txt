Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_builtin-sched.c_sched_out_state.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function may result in undefined behavior if `prev_state` exceeds the bounds of the `TASK_STATE_TO_CHAR_STR` array. Accessing out-of-bounds elements in an array constitutes undefined behavior as per the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: The function does not validate that `prev_state` is within the bounds of the `TASK_STATE_TO_CHAR_STR` array. If `prev_state` is larger than or equal to the length of the array, this will cause out-of-bounds memory access, which is a bug.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check for `prev_state` to ensure it does not exceed the length of `TASK_STATE_TO_CHAR_STR`:
```c
static char sched_out_state(u64 prev_state)
{
    const char *str = TASK_STATE_TO_CHAR_STR;

    size_t len = strlen(str); // Ensure some mechanism exists to determine the array length.
    if (prev_state >= len) {
        // Handle the case of invalid prev_state, e.g., return a default value or error.
        return '?';  // Example default value for invalid state.
    }

    return str[prev_state];
}
```
