Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nosy-dump.c_set_input_mode.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code does not check the return value of `tcgetattr()` or `tcsetattr()`, which signifies system calls that may fail. If either of these fail, subsequent operations relying on valid terminal attributes will cause undefined behavior. Specifically, the terminal attributes could be left in an inconsistent state.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: Not handling errors from `tcgetattr()` may cause the program to run incorrectly, as it assumes successful attribute retrieval. Similarly, failure to check `tcsetattr()` may lead to unintended terminal configurations or behavior. The lack of error handling for `isatty(STDIN_FILENO)` returning false is handled through `exit(EXIT_FAILURE)`, so no bug arises there.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add error checks for `tcgetattr()` and `tcsetattr()`. If these functions fail, output an appropriate error message and handle the failure gracefully. Example fix:

```c
if (tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &saved_attributes) == -1) {
    perror("Failed to get terminal attributes");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
if (tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &tattr) == -1) {
    perror("Failed to get terminal attributes");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
if (tcsetattr(STDIN_FILENO, TCSAFLUSH, &tattr) == -1) {
    perror("Failed to set terminal attributes");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```
