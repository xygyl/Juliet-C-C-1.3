### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: 
1. Potential invalid pointer dereference in the line `nla_put_be64(skb, NFTA_OBJ_HANDLE, cpu_to_be64(obj->handle), NFTA_OBJ_PAD)` if `obj` or any of its nested pointers (`obj->ops` or `obj->ops->type`) is `NULL`. The code does not validate these pointers before accessing their members.
2. Similar risk exists earlier for the line `nla_put_be32(skb, NFTA_OBJ_TYPE, htonl(obj->ops->type->type))` due to direct access to the nested pointer `obj->ops->type`.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference (Risk Potential)
Bug Reason: 
The function does not ensure that `obj`, `obj->ops`, or `obj->ops->type` are valid non-NULL pointers before accessing their members, which can lead to undefined behavior (dereferencing NULL or invalid pointers) and a potential kernel crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

### Confidence: High
The issue is clear and directly observable in the code. Lack of pointer validation before dereference is a common source of undefined behavior and crashes.

### Fix Suggestion:
Add explicit checks for `obj`, `obj->ops`, and `obj->ops->type` at the beginning of the function or before dereferencing these pointers. For example:
```c
if (!obj || !obj->ops || !obj->ops->type) {
    nlmsg_trim(skb, nlh);
    return -1;
}
```
This will prevent invalid pointer dereferences and mitigate the risk of undefined behavior or kernel crashes.
