Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pinctrl-paris.c_mtk_pconf_group_get.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function accesses `hw->groups[group].config` without validating `group` against the bounds of the `hw->groups` array. If `group` is an out-of-bounds index, this results in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The lack of validation for the `group` parameter could lead to a memory corruption or invalid reads, as an out-of-bounds access is attempted on the `hw->groups` array.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check for `group`, such as verifying `group` is less than the size of the `groups` array (`sizeof(hw->groups)/sizeof(hw->groups[0]` or another method of determining the array size) before accessing the `config` member.

Example Fix:
```c
if (group >= sizeof(hw->groups)/sizeof(hw->groups[0])) {
    return -EINVAL; // Or another appropriate error code
}
*config = hw->groups[group].config;
return 0;
```
