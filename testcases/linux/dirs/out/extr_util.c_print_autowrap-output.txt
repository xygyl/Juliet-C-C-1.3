Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_util.c_print_autowrap.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses a variable-length array `char tempstr[MAX_LEN + 1]` initialized with `strcpy(tempstr, prompt)` without ensuring that `prompt` does not exceed `MAX_LEN`. If `prompt` is longer than `MAX_LEN`, `strcpy` will write out of bounds, causing undefined behavior. Additionally, pointer arithmetic (`sp2 - sp`) is used without proper checks, leading to potential dereferencing of invalid pointers.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The function assumes `prompt` is shorter than `MAX_LEN`; if it's longer, `strcpy` will corrupt memory, causing undefined behavior and memory-related bugs. This overflows `tempstr`, destroying its contents and potentially impacting the surrounding stack.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `strcpy(tempstr, prompt)` with a bounded copy, such as `strncpy(tempstr, prompt, MAX_LEN)` to ensure no overflow occurs. Additionally, validate pointer operations and ensure no pointer arithmetic is performed on `sp` and `sp2` when pointers could be invalid or uninitialized. Add a check for null pointers before dereferencing or removing newline separators.
