Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_ipw2200.c_ipw_wx_get_range.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The calculation `range->bitrate[i] = (priv->rates.supported_rates[i] & 0x7F) * 500000;` may trigger undefined behavior if `priv->rates.supported_rates` does not have `range->num_bitrates` elements or is improperly initialized. Accessing out-of-bounds elements results in undefined behavior. This depends on the correctness of `priv->rates.num_rates` value.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related bug, specifically potential out-of-bounds access.
Bug Reason: The loop accessing `priv->rates.supported_rates` relies on an external limit (`priv->rates.num_rates`) which may not match the actual array bounds. This mismatch would cause memory corruption or crashes due to out-of-bounds access.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Validate that `priv->rates.num_rates` does not exceed the size of `priv->rates.supported_rates` before entering the loop. Also, ensure that `priv->rates.supported_rates` is properly initialized and populated prior to use.
