Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_a4xx.xml.h_A4XX_SSBO_1_0_CPP.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function performs a left-shift operation (`val << A4XX_SSBO_1_0_CPP__SHIFT`) on a `uint32_t` type. If `A4XX_SSBO_1_0_CPP__SHIFT` exceeds or equals the width of `uint32_t` (32 bits), this leads to undefined behavior according to the C standard. The C standard does not define behavior for left-shifting values beyond the number of bits in the type.
Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: None
Bug Reason: The operation appears logically consistent as long as `A4XX_SSBO_1_0_CPP__SHIFT` is within bounds (0–31). However, undefined behavior could result in unpredictable consequences.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `A4XX_SSBO_1_0_CPP__SHIFT` is constrained within the valid range (0–31). For instance, add a runtime check or define `A4XX_SSBO_1_0_CPP__SHIFT` properly to be guaranteed within bounds:
```c
#define A4XX_SSBO_1_0_CPP__SHIFT (value_within_0_to_31)
```
Alternatively, use a static assert if compatible with the tools/framework:
```c
_Static_assert(A4XX_SSBO_1_0_CPP__SHIFT < 32, "Shift exceeds uint32_t width");
```
