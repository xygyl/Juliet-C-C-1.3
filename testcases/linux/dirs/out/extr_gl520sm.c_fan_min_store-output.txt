Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_gl520sm.c_fan_min_store.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds array access when accessing `data->fan_div[n]` or `data->fan_min[n]`. Index `n` is derived from `to_sensor_dev_attr(attr)->index`, but its validity isn't checked within the bounds of the arrays `data->fan_div` or `data->fan_min`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: Lack of validation for the index `n` could lead to unpredictable behavior if it exceeds the bounds of `data->fan_div` or `data->fan_min`. This might result in accessing invalid memory, leading to runtime crashes or incorrect functionality.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate `n` against the bounds of the `data->fan_div` and `data->fan_min` arrays before using it (e.g., ensure `n >= 0 && n < ARRAY_SIZE(data->fan_div)`).

Example Fix:
```c
if (n < 0 || n >= ARRAY_SIZE(data->fan_div))
    return -EINVAL;
```
