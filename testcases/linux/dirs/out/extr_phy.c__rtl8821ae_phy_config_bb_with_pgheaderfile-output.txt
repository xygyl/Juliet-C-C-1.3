UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses unchecked array indexing with variable increments (`array[i+1]`, `array[i+2]`, etc.). If `i + 1`, `i + 2`, or similar exceeds `arraylen`, it results in out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior in C.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: As identified in the UB analysis, unchecked index access `array[i+1]`, `array[i+2]`, etc., combined with the `i += 6` stepping loop, may lead to reading past the end of the `array` buffer. This can corrupt memory or cause crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking to ensure that `i + 1`, `i + 2`, ..., and `i + 5` do not exceed `arraylen` before accessing the array. For example:
```c
if (i + 5 >= arraylen) {
    break; // Avoid invalid memory access
}
```
