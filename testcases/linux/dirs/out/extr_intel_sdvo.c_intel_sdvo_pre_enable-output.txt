Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel_sdvo.c_intel_sdvo_pre_enable.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow is possible in the expression `(9 << 19)` if `9` (signed int) is left-shifted by 19 bits, producing a value that exceeds the maximum signed int size (2^31-1). As per the C standard, signed integer overflow results in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The handling of the pixel multiplier in the switch statement has a default case (`default`) that does not properly abort on an invalid value and instead proceeds incorrectly. This could lead to an invalid configuration if `crtc_state->pixel_multiplier` contains an unexpected value.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
1. To avoid signed integer overflow, explicitly ensure the value or operation is performed on an `unsigned int` type (e.g., `(9U << 19)`).
2. Add proper error handling in the `default` case for the pixel multiplier switch statement, such as logging the error and aborting the function safely.
