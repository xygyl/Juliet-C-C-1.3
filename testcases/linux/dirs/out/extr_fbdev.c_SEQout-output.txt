UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `par` is `NULL`, accessing `par->riva.PVIO` results in undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer. Additionally, if `riva.PVIO` contains an invalid pointer or uninitialized memory, the function could result in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether `par` is `NULL` before dereferencing it. This could lead to a crash or undefined behavior at runtime.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for `par` at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (par == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
Alternatively, ensure that `par` is always correctly initialized and non-NULL before calling this function.
