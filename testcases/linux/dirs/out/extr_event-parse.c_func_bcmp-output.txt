UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `(fb+1)` pointer arithmetic on `fb` assumes a valid memory span is allocated for the `func_map` structure. If `fb` points to the last element or an invalid location (such as unallocated memory), dereferencing `(fb+1)` leads to undefined behavior, as accessing memory beyond allocated bounds violates C standard memory safety rules.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds memory access  
Bug Reason: Accessing `(fb+1)->addr` assumes `fb+1` points to valid memory, which could lead to an out-of-bounds access if `fb` refers to the last element of the structure array or invalid memory. This is both a memory safety and logical flaw.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking for `fb` to ensure it does not point to the last element before performing `(fb+1)` pointer arithmetic. For example:  
```c
static int func_bcmp(const void *a, const void *b) 
{
    const struct func_map *fa = a;
    const struct func_map *fb = b;

    if ((fa->addr == fb->addr) || 
        ((fa->addr > fb->addr) && 
         fb != NULL /* Ensure fb points to a valid memory location */))
    {
        return 0;
    }

    if (fa->addr < fb->addr)
        return -1;

    return 1;
}
```
However, this check assumes that the `fb+1` pointer will also not exceed array bounds; ideally, enhance the API to capture array size explicitly.
