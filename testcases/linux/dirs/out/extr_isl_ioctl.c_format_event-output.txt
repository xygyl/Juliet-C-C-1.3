Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_isl_ioctl.c_format_event.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The call to `snprintf` does not guarantee that the string will fit into `dest` if the formatted string length is greater than `IW_CUSTOM_MAX`. This can result in buffer overflow, which is undefined behavior. Additionally, the `WARN_ON` macro implicitly depends on the variable `n`, but if `n < 0`, this macro would operate on an invalid result from `snprintf` (e.g., negative length).  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: If the formatted string exceeds `IW_CUSTOM_MAX` characters, `snprintf` does not prevent writing beyond the bounds of `dest`, leading to a buffer overflow. This poses a memory corruption risk.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Check the return value of `snprintf` for errors or ensure bounds are strictly adhered to by validating the inputs to `snprintf`. Alternatively, use `strncat` or other constrained string manipulation functions coupled with explicit bounds checks:
```c
if (n < 0 || n >= IW_CUSTOM_MAX) {
    WARN_ON(1);
    // Handle error here, such as truncating output or returning an error to the caller.
    n = IW_CUSTOM_MAX - 1;
}
``` 
Ensure that the destination buffer is null-terminated, and pay special attention to the size of `IW_CUSTOM_MAX`. Reduce the formatting content if necessary.
