### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Potential Overflow in `memcpy`:**  
   The `memcpy` call attempts to copy from `tid_info->blocks` into `tasks->blocks`. Assuming `tasks->blocks` is an array, it is unclear whether it has sufficient allocated size to hold `MAX_TID_BLOCKS_FCOE * sizeof(u8 *)` bytes. If `tasks->blocks` is smaller than the required size, this invokes undefined behavior due to a buffer overflow.  
2. **Dereferencing Null Pointer:**  
   There is a potential dereference of `tasks` without ensuring it is non-null. If `tasks` is null, accessing its members such as `tasks->size` or `tasks->blocks` triggers undefined behavior.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer overflow  
Bug Reason:  
The code assumes `tasks->blocks` to have sufficient space to store `MAX_TID_BLOCKS_FCOE` pointers but does not validate its size before performing the `memcpy`. This can cause memory corruption if `tasks->blocks` is smaller than the data being copied.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
1. **Validate `tasks` for Null:** Add a null-pointer check before accessing `tasks` members, e.g.:
   ```c
   if (!tasks) {
       DP_NOTICE(cdev, "Invalid tasks pointer\n");
       qed_fcoe_stop(cdev);
       return -EINVAL;
   }
   ```

2. **Ensure `tasks->blocks` Has Sufficient Space:** Either dynamically allocate memory for `tasks->blocks` or verify its size before performing the `memcpy`. For partial protection:
   ```c
   if (sizeof(tasks->blocks) < MAX_TID_BLOCKS_FCOE * sizeof(u8 *)) {
       DP_NOTICE(cdev, "Insufficient space in tasks->blocks\n");
       qed_fcoe_stop(cdev);
       return -ENOMEM;
   }
   ```

3. **Bounds Checking for Memcpy:** Add boundary validation for memory allocation before copying data from `tid_info->blocks` to `tasks->blocks`.
