Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_hyperv_timer.c_hv_stimer_free.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Dereferencing a potentially null pointer as `hv_clock_event` is set to NULL after being freed. The `free_percpu()` function deallocates the memory associated with `hv_clock_event`, making any access to it afterward undefined behavior if the pointer is dereferenced.
Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: N/A
Bug Reason: While there is UB due to improper use of deallocated `hv_clock_event`, there aren't additional logic or memory-related bugs that deviate from the intended functionality of the function itself.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Move `hv_clock_event = NULL;` immediately after the call to `free_percpu(hv_clock_event)` to avoid accidental dereferencing of a dangling pointer.
