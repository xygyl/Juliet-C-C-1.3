UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Access to the dereferenced `ureq` pointer without verifying whether its allocation (`usbhsh_ureq_alloc()`) was successful. This leads to undefined behavior if `ureq` remains `NULL`. This is already flagged properly by the existing code in lines that check `if (unlikely(!ureq))` and return `-ENOMEM` but there must not be additional undefined behavior arising further.  

Bug Detected: Yes
