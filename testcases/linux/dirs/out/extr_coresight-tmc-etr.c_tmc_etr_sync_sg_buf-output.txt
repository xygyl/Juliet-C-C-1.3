Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_coresight-tmc-etr.c_tmc_etr_sync_sg_buf.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code does not validate the return value of `tmc_sg_get_data_page_offset` appropriately before using it as an argument to `tmc_sg_table_sync_data_range`. If `r_offset` or `w_offset` is negative, calculating `etr_buf->len` or calling `tmc_sg_table_sync_data_range(table, r_offset, etr_buf->len)` leads to undefined behavior due to passing invalid arguments (e.g., negative offsets or lengths) to functions that likely expect valid ranges.
 
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Bug
Bug Reason: The computation of `etr_buf->len` relies on `r_offset` and `w_offset` which are set even when they are invalid (negative values). Additionally, the use of `tmc_sg_table_sync_data_range` with potentially invalid `r_offset` and `len` may lead to incorrect synchronization logic or runtime errors.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add proper validation checks after setting `r_offset` and `w_offset` to ensure they have valid, non-negative values before computing `etr_buf->len` or calling `tmc_sg_table_sync_data_range`. If either offset is invalid, the function should exit with an error, similar to how it currently handles invalid `r_offset` and `w_offset` in earlier checks.

Example fix:
```c
if (r_offset < 0 || w_offset < 0) {
    dev_warn(table->dev,
             "Invalid offset calculated: RRP %llx (%ld), RWP %llx (%ld)\n",
             rrp, r_offset, rwp, w_offset);
    etr_buf->len = 0;
    return;
}
```
