UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The right shift operation `val >> 5` can lead to undefined behavior if `val` is greater than 31 bits and system-specific integer overflow occurs. Additionally, the shifting assumes the value used fits within a defined limit; failure to enforce bounds on `val` risks uncontrolled behavior.
 
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer overflow/underflow
Bug Reason: If `val` contains large integers exceeding the `uint32_t` range during shifts, incorrect masking and operations might yield invalid results.
Bug Caused by UB: Also.
