Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_ion.c_free_duped_table.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `table` is `NULL`, calling `sg_free_table(table)` or `kfree(table)` results in undefined behavior because the behavior of `sg_free_table` is not guaranteed with a `NULL` pointer, and `kfree(NULL)` may cause unexpected consequences depending on the platform's implementation. The C standard does not guarantee the safety of dereferencing or operating on null pointers.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: Invoking `sg_free_table` and `kfree` without verifying that `table` is non-`NULL` can lead to runtime crashes or undefined behavior. Most likely, `sg_free_table` will attempt to access or operate on the `NULL` pointer if it doesn't internally check for `NULL`, causing a null pointer dereference.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `table` is non-`NULL` before making calls:  
```c
static void free_duped_table(struct sg_table *table)  
{  
    if (table != NULL) {  
        sg_free_table(table);  
        kfree(table);  
    }  
}  
```
