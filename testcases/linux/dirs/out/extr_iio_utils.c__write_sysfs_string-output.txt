Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_iio_utils.c__write_sysfs_string.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `fscanf` function expects `temp` to hold sufficient memory to store the string it reads, yet `temp` has been dynamically allocated with a size based on `strlen(basedir) + strlen(filename) + 2` and repurposed. If the size of `val` or the content being read into `temp` exceeds this allocated size, a buffer overflow occurs, resulting in undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: `temp` is reused during the `fscanf` operation without ensuring its size matches the length of the input being read. The input being read could be longer than the memory allocated for `temp`, leading to a buffer overflow and potential corruption of the program's memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Allocate a larger buffer for `temp` or use a dedicated buffer for reading values during the verification phase, ensuring it has a size capable of safely holding the largest potential string value, and validate the size of the input against this allocated memory. For example, dynamically compute and allocate sufficient memory:
```c
char *verify_buf = malloc(MAX_LENGTH); // choose an appropriate MAX_LENGTH
if (!verify_buf) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed\n");
    return -ENOMEM;
}
```
Alternatively, use static buffers if acceptable within the context and constraints of the Linux kernel. Proper bounds checking is recommended before using dynamically determined input lengths.
