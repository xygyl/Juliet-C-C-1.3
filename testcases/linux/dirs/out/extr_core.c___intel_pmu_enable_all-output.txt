UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `WARN_ON_ONCE(!event)` expression may trigger undefined behavior depending on implementation. The condition could pass (event is NULL), and subsequent dereferencing of `event->hw.config` would lead to null pointer dereference, which is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: If `event` is `NULL`, the code attempts to use `event->hw.config`, causing a null pointer dereference. Additionally, the `WARN_ON_ONCE` macro does not prevent further code execution after logging the warning.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a proper check after `WARN_ON_ONCE` to ensure that the function exits early if `event` is NULL. For example:  

```c
if (WARN_ON_ONCE(!event))  
    return;  
```
