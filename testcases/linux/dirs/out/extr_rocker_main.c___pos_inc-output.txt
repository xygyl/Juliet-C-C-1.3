Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_rocker_main.c___pos_inc.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The expression `++pos` causes undefined behavior if `pos` was previously holding the maximum value representable by an `u32` type (typically `UINT_MAX`). Incrementing such a value results in an integer wraparound, and unsigned integer wraparound is technically defined as per the standard for unsigned types. Hence, there is no UB for unsigned integersâ€™ `u32.`  
Bug Detected:  
Bug Type: internal edge bounds/buffer ranges etc-mechanics safe etc edges seems(cfalse boolean too about overall flow edges)
Bug Reason(noptional):
