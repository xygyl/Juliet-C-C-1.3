UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: This function has potential for undefined behavior concerning signed integer overflow. For example, `size = label->lnx.formatted_blocks * secperblk;` involves possible multiplication of large values as `label->lnx.formatted_blocks` and `secperblk` are both integers. If this multiplication exceeds `INT_MAX`, it results in undefined behavior according to the C standard because signed integer overflow is undefined. Furthermore, the use of `snprintf()` with `char tmp[64]` may lead to potential truncation issues depending on the size of the formatted string, although truncation itself does not constitute undefined behavior—it could lead to incorrect results.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw (possible integer overflow)  
Bug Reason: The logic does not safeguard `label->lnx.formatted_blocks * secperblk` from overflowing the integer type. If this value exceeds the range of `int`, the computed size could be invalid, leading to incorrect partition offsets being calculated and ultimately erroneous disk partition information being written. Additionally, there’s a minor possibility of faulty behavior if `info` is null and no checks exist to handle this properly.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes, the logic flaw stems from the undefined behavior (integer overflow).  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Use data types like `uint64_t` or `unsigned long long` for computation of large sizes such as `label->lnx.formatted_blocks * secperblk` to avoid integer overflow. Ensure `sizeof(tmp)` is adequate to store formatted output from `snprintf()` and check for truncation explicitly if necessary. Add explicit null checks on `info` (though one exists implicitly in the current code). For example:
```c
uint64_t size;
if (label->lnx.ldl_version == 0xf2) {
    size = (uint64_t)label->lnx.formatted_blocks * secperblk;
} else {
    geo_size = (uint64_t)geo->cylinders * geo->heads * geo->sectors * secperblk;
    size = (uint64_t)i_size >> 9;
    if (size != geo_size) {
        if (!info) {
            strlcat(state->pp_buf, "\n", PAGE_SIZE);
            return 1;
        }
        if (!strcmp(info->type, "ECKD")) {
            if (geo_size < size) {
                size = geo_size;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
