Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_i915_active.c_live_active_retire.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences `active->retired` without verifying if `active` is non-NULL after `IS_ERR(active)`. If `active` is NULL, dereferencing it leads to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `__live_active_setup()` returns a NULL pointer (not just an error constant captured by `IS_ERR`), `active->retired` would be dereferenced, causing a null pointer dereference error.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add an explicit check `if (active == NULL)` after the `IS_ERR(active)` condition, or refine `__live_active_setup()` so that it does not return NULL in addition to error codes wrapped by `IS_ERR()`.
