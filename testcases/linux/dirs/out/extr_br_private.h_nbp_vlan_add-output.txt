UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing the pointer `changed` without ensuring that it is valid or non-NULL leads to undefined behavior. If `changed` is passed as `NULL`, the dereference `*changed = false;` would trigger undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not verify whether the `changed` pointer is valid before dereferencing it. Passing `NULL` for `changed` as a parameter would result in a null pointer dereference.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `changed` is not `NULL` before dereferencing it. For example:
```c
if (changed)
    *changed = false;
```
