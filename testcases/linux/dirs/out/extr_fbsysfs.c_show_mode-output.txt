Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fbsysfs.c_show_mode.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The dereferencing of `fb_info->mode` assumes that `fb_info` (result of `dev_get_drvdata`) is not `NULL`. However, there is no guarantee that `dev_get_drvdata(device)` will return a valid pointer. If `fb_info` is `NULL`, dereferencing `fb_info->mode` results in undefined behavior (null pointer dereference).
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `dev_get_drvdata(device)` returns `NULL`, the code accesses `fb_info->mode`, leading to a null pointer dereference.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
- Add a null check for `fb_info` before accessing `fb_info->mode`. For example:
```c
struct fb_info *fb_info = dev_get_drvdata(device);

if (!fb_info || !fb_info->mode)
    return 0;

return mode_string(buf, 0, fb_info->mode);
```
By ensuring `fb_info` is valid, both UB and the associated bug are prevented.
