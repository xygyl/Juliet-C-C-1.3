Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hash.c_mv_cesa_ahash_dma_add_cache.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `creq->cache_ptr` contains a value larger than the size of `ahashdreq->cache`, the call to `memcpy` may result in a buffer overflow, which is undefined behavior as per the C standard. The size and allocation of `ahashdreq->cache` are not verified or enforced at runtime to match `creq->cache_ptr`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `creq->cache_ptr` is within the bounds of the memory allocated for `ahashdreq->cache` without verifying it. This could result in overwriting adjacent memory if the assumption is incorrect.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check before calling `memcpy`. Verify that the value of `creq->cache_ptr` does not exceed the size of the memory allocated for `ahashdreq->cache`. For example:
```c
if (creq->cache_ptr > allocated_cache_size) {
    return -EINVAL; // Or a suitable error code.
}
```
Alternatively, ensure that the allocation size in `mv_cesa_ahash_dma_alloc_cache` matches the size indicated by `creq->cache_ptr`.
