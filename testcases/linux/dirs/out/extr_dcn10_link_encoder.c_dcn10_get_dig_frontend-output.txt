UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Undefined behavior may occur due to the `ASSERT(false)` statement when the default case of the switch is reached. Many implementations define `ASSERT` as triggering a null dereference, calling `abort()`, or another disruptive action, which is undefined behavior in C.
Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: N/A
Bug Reason: The function logic appears correct, and all cases map to valid values or an appropriate fallback (ENGINE_ID_UNKNOWN). Despite potentially disruptive behavior from `ASSERT(false)`, this does not cause a bug in the return logic.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Replace `ASSERT(false)` with an explicit error handling mechanism, such as logging an error and exiting gracefully without invoking undefined behavior.

Example fix:
```c
default:
    // invalid source select DIG
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: Invalid DIG_FE_SOURCE_SELECT value: %d\n", value);
    result = ENGINE_ID_UNKNOWN;
}
```
