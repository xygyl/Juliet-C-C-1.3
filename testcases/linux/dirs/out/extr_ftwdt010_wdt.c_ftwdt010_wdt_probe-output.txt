Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_ftwdt010_wdt.c_ftwdt010_wdt_probe.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The expression `0xFFFFFFFF / WDT_CLOCK` for `gwdt->wdd.max_timeout` can result in undefined behavior if `WDT_CLOCK` is zero. Division by zero in C is undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: Since `WDT_CLOCK` could theoretically be zero, this would lead to an incorrect calculation for `gwdt->wdd.max_timeout` and potentially an incorrect upper limit for the watchdog timeout configuration, making the function's behavior unreliable.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Verify that `WDT_CLOCK` is not zero before performing the division. Add a check at the beginning of the function, e.g.:

```c
if (WDT_CLOCK == 0) {
    dev_err(dev, "WDT_CLOCK is zero, cannot proceed\n");
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
