### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing `current_tlv->data` in the loop to compute the next `current_tlv` could lead to undefined behavior if `tlv_buf_left` becomes smaller than the required size for a valid TLV. This happens because `current_tlv` might point to invalid memory after an incorrectly calculated offset. Additionally, there is no guarantee that `current_tlv->data` is properly aligned for casting since `current_tlv` points to arbitrary memory locations within the TLV buffer. Misaligned pointer access violates the C standard and causes undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory corruption  
Bug Reason: If `sizeof(tlv->header) + tlv_len > tlv_buf_left` (indicating corrupt or malformed TLV buffers), the loop can proceed with invalid memory calculations and result in dereferencing or updating invalid memory addresses, potentially causing memory corruption or crashes. The termination condition for breaking the loop when corruption is detected is incomplete, as the execution continues iterating.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
- Include more robust checks before dereferencing `current_tlv->data`. For example:  
```c
if (tlv_buf_left < sizeof(tlv->header) || sizeof(tlv->header) + tlv_len > tlv_buf_left) {
    mwifiex_dbg(adapter, ERROR, "SCAN_RESP: TLV buffer corrupt or insufficient data\n");
    break;
}
```
- Add explicit handling for malformed TLV buffers and ensure all `current_tlv->data` pointer arithmetic is performed within valid bounds and properly aligned.  
- After detecting a corrupted TLV buffer, immediately return from the function or employ error reporting and recovery mechanisms instead of continuing to process remaining data.
