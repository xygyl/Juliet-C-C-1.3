Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_whc-rc.c_whcrc_probe.c
UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function `whcrc_probe` does not exhibit undefined behavior. Memory allocation functions (`kzalloc`, `uwb_rc_alloc`) are checked for failure, and appropriate error handling is performed. There is no dereferencing of null pointers or usage of uninitialized memory. Additionally, there is no evidence of signed integer overflow or violations of strict aliasing rules.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Leak
Bug Reason: If the call to `whcrc_setup_rc_umc()` fails (`result < 0`), the allocated `uwb_rc` instance is not released but only `whcrc` (via `kfree`). This causes a memory leak as `uwb_rc` was allocated via `uwb_rc_alloc()` but not freed in this error path.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a call to `uwb_rc_put(uwb_rc)` in the `error_setup_rc_umc` cleanup path to ensure that memory allocated via `uwb_rc_alloc()` is properly released when a subsequent failure occurs. Specifically:
```c
error_setup_rc_umc:
    kfree(whcrc);
    uwb_rc_put(uwb_rc); // Free the memory allocated for uwb_rc
    goto error_alloc;
```
```
