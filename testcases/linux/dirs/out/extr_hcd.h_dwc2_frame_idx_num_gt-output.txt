### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The subtraction operation `fr_idx1 - fr_idx2` can potentially result in an unsigned integer wraparound, which is well-defined in C (not UB). However, the usage of `FRLISTEN_64_SIZE >> 1` assumes that `FRLISTEN_64_SIZE` is a power of two and all its bits fit within the range of `u16`. If `FRLISTEN_64_SIZE >> 1` exceeds the size or does not adhere to this assumption, undefined behavior could occur when accessing an out-of-bounds portion of the value. This information is inferred as `FRLISTEN_64_SIZE` is not defined in the provided code. This analysis depends on external context assuming `FRLISTEN_64_SIZE` represents a valid shift operation and no UB exists.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The calculation `diff && !sign` can yield incorrect results if the values of `fr_idx1` and `fr_idx2` are carefully chosen such that `diff` is non-zero but the sign bit (`sign`) is irrelevant. This might cause incorrect comparisons of frame indices. Furthermore, the function appears to assume a modular arithmetic context typical in frame indexing, but it does not validate the range or modularity of the inputs explicitly. If `FRLISTEN_64_SIZE` is ill-defined, this could lead to logical errors.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Validate that `FRLISTEN_64_SIZE` is a valid constant and does not cause issues with the shift operation or overflow.
2. Explicitly verify that the inputs `fr_idx1` and `fr_idx2` are within the expected bounds (e.g., less than `FRLISTEN_64_SIZE`).
3. Consider modular arithmetic for frame index comparisons if intended to handle wraparounds robustly:
   ```c
   static inline bool dwc2_frame_idx_num_gt(u16 fr_idx1, u16 fr_idx2) {
       u16 diff = (fr_idx1 + FRLISTEN_64_SIZE - fr_idx2) % FRLISTEN_64_SIZE;
       return diff && diff < (FRLISTEN_64_SIZE >> 1);
   }
   ```
