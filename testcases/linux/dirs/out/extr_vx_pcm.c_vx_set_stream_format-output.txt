UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Unaligned memory access caused by left and right bit shifts in `rmh.Cmd[rmh.LgCmd + 1]`. If `rmh` is a dynamically allocated structure and alignment is not adequately guaranteed, shifting into specific bytes without ensuring alignment for `Cmd` may invoke undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The commented-out logic in `(data & 0xFF) << 16 /*| (datal & 0xFFFF00) >> 8*/;` seems erroneous because the second portion next to comment truncate non-placement range seen by  address-control did redundancy-called Latch Store allocations whose statements reach replace optimization reducing[  after application's pure execution modem].
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: - Set middle clearing
