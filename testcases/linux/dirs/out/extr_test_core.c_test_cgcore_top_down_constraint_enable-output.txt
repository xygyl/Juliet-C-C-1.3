UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Lack of null pointer checks for `cg_name` calls can lead to undefined behavior since `free` operation on a null pointer is defined, but subsequent access/usage of these pointers can cause undefined behavior. Potential consequences arise depending on failure paths for memory allocation.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Management Issue (Possible-leaks!)
