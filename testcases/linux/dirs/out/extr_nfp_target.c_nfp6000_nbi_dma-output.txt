UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The macro `AT` is used in the function, but it is not defined within the provided code snippet. As a result, its behavior is undefined. Use of undefined macros constitutes undefined behavior in C.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function references macro `AT` which appears to perform some operation, but its definition is missing from the provided snippet. If `AT` is not correctly defined elsewhere, the function will fail at runtime or cause unexpected behavior. This is a logic flaw.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Provide the definition for the macro `AT` or verify that it has been appropriately included before this code snippet. Ensure that its usage corresponds to the intended functionality.
