Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mtdpart.c_mtd_get_device_size.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential infinite recursion due to uncontrolled recursive calls in `mtd_get_device_size`. If `mtd_is_partition` continually returns true and `mtd_to_part(mtd)->parent` points back to itself or to a similar structure causing cyclic recursion, this leads to undefined behavior as stack overflow.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Infinite Recursion
Bug Reason: The function recursively calls itself without a termination condition for scenarios where `mtd_to_part(mtd)->parent` points back to a cyclic reference or continues to return partitions indefinitely.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Introduce a mechanism to detect and handle cyclic recursion. For example, maintain a set of visited nodes (e.g., mtd devices) to prevent revisiting the same device or structure. Alternatively, set a recursion depth limit and return an error under suspicious conditions.
