Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_rocker_ofdpa.c_ofdpa_group_tbl_entry_free.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `entry` is dereferenced before being checked for null value. If the function is called with a null pointer (`entry` == NULL), `ROCKER_GROUP_TYPE_GET(entry->group_id)` will result in undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `entry` is `NULL`, the function will attempt to access `entry->group_id`, leading to null pointer dereference.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (entry == NULL)
    return;
```
