UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer division can cause undefined behavior if `total_bw` is zero. Even though the condition `if ((!total_bw) || (!cos0_bw) || (!cos1_bw))` should prevent this scenario, operations such as `cos0_bw * ETS_BW_LIMIT_CREDIT_WEIGHT / total_bw` theoretically involve dividing by `total_bw`, which would lead to UB if it weren't guarded properly. Additionally, integer overflow during multiplication (`cos0_bw * ETS_BW_LIMIT_CREDIT_WEIGHT`) could result in UB due to exceeding `u32` bounds.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: Dividing by `total_bw` is logically safe due to the `if` guard, but the function risks integer overflow in the computation `(cos0_bw * ETS_BW_LIMIT_CREDIT_WEIGHT)` and `cos1_bw * ETS_BW_LIMIT_CREDIT_WEIGHT`. If `cos0_bw` and `ETS_BW_LIMIT_CREDIT_WEIGHT` are large enough, this multiplication could exceed the range of `u32`, leading to incorrect `cosX_credit_weight` values or silent wrap-around.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: To prevent UB and overflow, ensure the multiplication result fits within the bounds of `u32` by verifying `cos0_bw * ETS_BW_LIMIT_CREDIT_WEIGHT <= UINT32_MAX`. Alternatively, use a larger intermediate type, such as `uint64_t`, for calculations and explicitly cast results back to `u32` if valid.
