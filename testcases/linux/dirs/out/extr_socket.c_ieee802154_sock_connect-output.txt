UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `uaddr` parameter is dereferenced (`uaddr->sa_family`) before verifying whether it is a valid, non-NULL pointer. If `uaddr` is NULL, this results in undefined behavior due to a null pointer dereference.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: As stated in the UB reason, dereferencing the `uaddr` pointer without confirming it is a valid, non-NULL pointer would cause a crash or other undefined behavior. Function implementations typically assume non-NULL pointers, but this is not guaranteed here.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Validate the `uaddr` pointer before accessing its members. Add a check such as:
```c
if (uaddr == NULL)
    return -EINVAL;
```
This ensures the function behaves correctly when `uaddr` is NULL.
