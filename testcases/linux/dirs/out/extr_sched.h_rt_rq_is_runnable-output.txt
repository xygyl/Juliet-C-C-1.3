Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sched.h_rt_rq_is_runnable.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences `rt_rq` without confirming that it is not `NULL`. Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer constitutes undefined behavior in C.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If the `rt_rq` pointer passed to the function is `NULL`, accessing its members `rt_queued` and `rt_nr_running` will result in a null pointer dereference, causing a runtime error.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `rt_rq` is not `NULL`, like:
```c
if (!rt_rq)
    return false;
```
