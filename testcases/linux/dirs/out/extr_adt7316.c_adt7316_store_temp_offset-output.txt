UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow could occur during the line `data += 256` if `data` is already close to INT_MAX (largest possible signed integer). The behavior of signed integer overflow is undefined according to the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: The `data += 256` computation can lead to integer overflow for very large positive values of `data`. Although the value is limited to <= 127 above, this limit is not enforced within the data type's theoretical range or system constraints.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Prior to the computation, ensure the data type can handle the result without overflow. An alternative is using an appropriate unsigned integer type or handling the value safely. For example:
```c
if (data < 0)
    data = (int)((unsigned int)data + 256);
```
