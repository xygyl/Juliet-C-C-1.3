UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `li->cache` is null, dereferencing `li->cache->discard_block_size` or `li->cache->discard_nr_blocks` will result in undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not check whether `li->cache` is null before accessing its members. If `li->cache` is null, the dereference operations (e.g., `li->cache->discard_nr_blocks` and `li->cache->discard_block_size`) will lead to a null pointer dereference, causing erroneous behavior and possibly crashing the system.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for `li->cache` at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!li->cache) {
    return;
}
```
This ensures the program does not attempt to access members of a null pointer.
