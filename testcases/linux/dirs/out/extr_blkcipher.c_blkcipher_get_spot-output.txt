UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function employs an "unsigned long" cast followed by a pointer arithmetic operation. This could cause undefined behavior when `start + len - 1` results in an overflow or when a pointer is cast to a numeric type in a way that results in misaligned memory access. Additionally, there's no guarantee that `start` and `start + len` correspond to valid memory addresses, meaning they could result in a pointer dereference of invalid memory.
Bug Detected: Yes
