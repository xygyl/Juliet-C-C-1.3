Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_irq-gic-v3-its.c_its_vpe_init.c

UB Detected: No
UB Reason: 
This function does not contain any undefined behavior. All operations, such as memory allocation and other assignments, are handled safely. There is no evidence of invalid pointer dereferencing, out‐of‐bounds access, or integer overflow, and all returned values from functions are checked prior to further use.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Leak
Bug Reason: 
If `its_alloc_vpe_table(vpe_id)` fails and the function returns `-ENOMEM`, the previously allocated `vpe_id` using `its_vpe_id_alloc()` is correctly freed with `its_vpe_id_free()`. However, the allocated `vpt_page` memory using `its_allocate_pending_table(GFP_KERNEL)` is not freed, resulting in a memory leak.

Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
In the failure case for `its_alloc_vpe_table(vpe_id)`, ensure that `its_free_pending_table(vpt_page)` is called prior to exiting the function. Suggested modification:
```c
if (!its_alloc_vpe_table(vpe_id)) {
    its_vpe_id_free(vpe_id);
    its_free_pending_table(vpt_page);  // Add this to free the memory.
    return -ENOMEM;
}
```
