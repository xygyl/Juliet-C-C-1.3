Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_lock_dlm.c_set_recover_size.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function may dereference null pointers for `ls->ls_recover_submit` or `ls->ls_recover_result` in the `memcpy` calls when `old_size` is greater than 0. These pointers are not explicitly checked for null before use, and could be null during those calls.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: As a result of the UB identified, null pointer dereference is possible during the `memcpy` calls when `old_size > 0` but no memory was allocated to `ls->ls_recover_submit` or `ls->ls_recover_result`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer checks for `ls->ls_recover_submit` and `ls->ls_recover_result` before using them in the `memcpy` calls. For example:
```c
if (ls->ls_recover_submit && ls->ls_recover_result) {
    memcpy(submit, ls->ls_recover_submit, old_size * sizeof(uint32_t));
    memcpy(result, ls->ls_recover_result, old_size * sizeof(uint32_t));
} else if (old_size > 0) {
    kfree(submit);
    kfree(result);
    return -ENOMEM;
}
```

In summary:
The function potentially exhibits undefined behavior and a related bug due to missing null pointer checks on dynamically allocated memory areas. A straightforward fix involves adding null pointer validation.
