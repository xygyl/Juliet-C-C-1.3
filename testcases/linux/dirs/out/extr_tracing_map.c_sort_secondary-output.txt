Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_tracing_map.c_sort_secondary.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The use of the function pointer cast `(int (*)(const void *, const void *))secondary_fn` in the call to `sort` might lead to undefined behavior (UB) depending on whether the function `secondary_fn` matches the signature expected by the `sort` function. The `cmp_entries_key` and `cmp_entries_sum` functions have a different type signature (`int(const struct tracing_map_sort_entry **, const struct tracing_map_sort_entry **)`) than that expected by `qsort`, which is `int(const void *, const void *)`. Passing mismatched signatures leads to UB in C.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: Incorrect use of function pointer casting causes unpredictable behavior during sorting. If the function signatures of `cmp_entries_key` or `cmp_entries_sum` do not match the strict requirements of the `sort` function, incorrect comparisons can occur, leading to improperly sorted output.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Modify the `cmp_entries_key` and `cmp_entries_sum` functions to explicitly conform to `int(const void *, const void *)` signature as required by `qsort`-style `sort` functions. Alternatively, provide wrapper functions that adapt the interface correctly for use within `sort`.
