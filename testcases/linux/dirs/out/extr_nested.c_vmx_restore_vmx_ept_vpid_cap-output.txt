UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `is_bitwise_subset` function is called with `-1ULL` as its third argument. If `is_bitwise_subset` expects a strictly unsigned value, then passing `-1ULL` could result in undefined behavior due to a signed-to-unsigned mismatch; however, based purely on context here, if `-1ULL` is treated as an unsigned 64-bit value, this operation isn't inherently UB. At runle also caught mis-scoping negligence
