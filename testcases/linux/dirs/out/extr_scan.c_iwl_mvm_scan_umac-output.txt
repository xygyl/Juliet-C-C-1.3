Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_scan.c_iwl_mvm_scan_umac.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is potential undefined behavior due to reliance on pointer arithmetic (`cmd_data + sizeof(struct iwl_scan_channel_cfg_umac) * mvm->fw->ucode_capa.n_scan_channels`) and possible misaligned memory access of `tail_v2`. Additionally, the use of `WARN_ON()` macro in conjunction with `params->n_scan_plans > IWL_MAX_SCHED_SCAN_PLANS` indicates potential reliance on external platform behavior that may not be well-defined according to the C standard (this could result in an unintended access or an early program exit).  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Infinity Bug  
Bug Reason: The `tail_v2->schedule[i - 1].iter_count = 0xff;` logic assumes that there will always be at least one valid scan plan in `params->scan_plans`. If `params->n_scan_plans == 0`, `i - 1` becomes negative, leading to an out-of-bounds struct access, undefined behavior, or memory corruption.
