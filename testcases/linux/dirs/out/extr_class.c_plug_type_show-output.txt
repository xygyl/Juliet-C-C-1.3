Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_class.c_plug_type_show.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function accesses `typec_plug_types[cable->type]` without validating `cable->type`. If `cable->type` is an invalid index (e.g., greater than or equal to the array size or negative), this is undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw / Memory safety
Bug Reason: Out-of-bounds access on `typec_plug_types` caused by an invalid value of `cable->type`. This can lead to program crashes or accessing garbage memory.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate `cable->type` before accessing `typec_plug_types`. Ensure it is within the valid range for the `typec_plug_types` array. Example fix:
```c
if (cable->type >= valid_typec_plug_types_count) {
    return -EINVAL; // Or handle error appropriately
}
```
