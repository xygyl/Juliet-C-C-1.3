### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `u32 val` variable is used uninitialized in the `stm32_adc_readl_poll_timeout()` macro/function on two occasions (lines where `!(val & STM32H7_ADCAL)` is used). If this macro or function reads the value of `val` directly in its condition before it's initialized, this results in undefined behavior due to reading from an uninitialized variable.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw, Use of Uninitialized Variable  
Bug Reason: The variable `val` is read uninitialized in the `stm32_adc_readl_poll_timeout()` calls. This can lead to unpredictable behavior depending on what value happens to be present in `val`, which is undefined. This issue may also propagate as a failed calibration if the logic depends on `val` being meaningful.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
Initialize the `val` variable to a deterministic value before usage in `stm32_adc_readl_poll_timeout()`. For instance:  
```c
u32 val = 0;
```  
This ensures no undefined behavior occurs and `val` starts with a well-defined value.
