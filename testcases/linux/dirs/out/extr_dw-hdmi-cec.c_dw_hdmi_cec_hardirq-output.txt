Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_dw-hdmi-cec.c_dw_hdmi_cec_hardirq.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The expression `HDMI_CEC_RX_DATA0 + i` may exceed the bounds of the `cec->rx_msg.msg` array if `i` grows to a value larger than the size of `cec->rx_msg.msg`. This out-of-bounds access is undefined behavior as per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: The code improperly restricts the length `len` read from `HDMI_CEC_RX_CNT`. Although it checks if `len > sizeof(cec->rx_msg.msg)` and adjusts `len` accordingly, the subsequent loop accesses `cec->rx_msg.msg[i]` without ensuring the calculated `HDMI_CEC_RX_DATA0 + i` falls within valid memory bounds of the hardware buffer. This introduces an out-of-bounds risk if `HDMI_CEC_RX_DATA0 + i` is invalid.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a stricter check against the validity of `HDMI_CEC_RX_DATA0 + i` before accessing it. Validate both `i` and the hardware read offset against guarantees provided by the hardware specification. Ensure correct type for `cec->rx_msg.msg` (e.g., ensure type matches hardware bytes explicitly) to prevent implicit type mismatches even if alignment issues are unlikely.
