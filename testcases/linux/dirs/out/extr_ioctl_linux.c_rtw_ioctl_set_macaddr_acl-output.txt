UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not validate the `param` pointer before dereferencing it (e.g., `param->u.mlme.command`). If `param` is NULL, this will result in undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The lack of validation of whether `param` is NULL might lead to null pointer dereference when accessing `param->u.mlme.command`. This oversight could cause a crash at runtime if the function is called with a NULL argument for `param`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `param` is not NULL before dereferencing it. For example:
```c
if (!param) {
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
