Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sort.c_sort__global_weight_cmp.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer subtraction can lead to undefined behavior if an integer overflow occurs. Since `left->stat.weight` and `right->stat.weight` are of type `scalar_t__`, which resolves to `int64_t`, their subtraction may result in a value exceeding the bounds of `int64_t`, causing undefined behavior as per the C standard.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason: Integer overflow during subtraction could lead to incorrect behavior â€” negative comparison results where they are unexpected, causing incorrect sorting logic and potentially undefined program behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Use a safe integer subtraction mechanism, such as explicit bounds checking or library functions that prevent overflow. Alternatively, compare the values directly (e.g., `if (left->stat.weight > right->stat.weight)` instead of directly subtracting).
