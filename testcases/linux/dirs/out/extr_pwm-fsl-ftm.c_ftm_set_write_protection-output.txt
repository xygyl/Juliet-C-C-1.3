**UB Analysis**  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: This function accesses `fpc->regmap` without ensuring that the pointer `fpc` is non-NULL. If `fpc` is NULL, dereferencing it to access `regmap` (`fpc->regmap`) results in undefined behavior.  

**Bug Analysis**  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether the argument `fpc` is non-NULL, which may lead to a null pointer dereference if `fpc` is unexpectedly NULL. There is no explicit null check for `fpc` before accessing its members.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

**Confidence**  
High  

**Fix Suggestion**  
Add a NULL check for `fpc` at the beginning of the function to ensure it is a valid pointer before accessing its members:
```c
if (fpc == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
Alternatively, return an error or log the issue depending on the design requirements.
