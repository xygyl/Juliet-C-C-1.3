UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences the `runtime->status` pointer without verifying if it is null. If this pointer is invalid or null, there is undefined behavior due to invalid memory access.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that the `runtime->status` pointer is always valid and does not check for null. If this pointer is null, dereferencing it will lead to a crash or undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before accessing `runtime->status->state`, check if `runtime->status` is null. For example:  
```c
if (!runtime->status) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return an appropriate error code
}
```
This check will ensure the function does not proceed with an invalid pointer.
