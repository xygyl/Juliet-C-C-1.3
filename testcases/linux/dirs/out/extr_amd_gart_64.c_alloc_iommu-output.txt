UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function performs a comparison where `offset` is checked against `-1`. The variable `offset` is declared as `unsigned long`, which is an unsigned type. Comparing an unsigned value against `-1` is undefined behavior because the `-1` value gets converted to an unsigned type through modulo arithmetic (`ULONG_MAX`). This leads to incorrect behavior and unintended logic.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The use of `-1` to indicate failure for `offset`, which is an `unsigned long`, is problematic and may lead to incorrect behavior, as `offset` cannot represent `-1` as an unsigned value. Additionally, failure detection based on the unsigned type will not work as intended.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Use a separate flag or sentinel value for error detection rather than relying on `-1` with an unsigned type. Alternatively, consider switching `offset` to a signed type (e.g., `long`) if negative values are needed to indicate failure.
