UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function potentially performs a pointer dereference on `pNetwork->bssht.bdHTInfoBuf` without verifying that it is a valid (non-NULL) pointer. This is undefined behavior since dereferencing NULL or invalid pointers is disallowed by the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `pNetwork->bssht.bdHTInfoBuf` is NULL, the typecast `(struct ht_info_ele *)pNetwork->bssht.bdHTInfoBuf` could result in a dereference of a NULL pointer when accessing `pPeerHTInfo->OptMode`. This would likely lead to a runtime crash.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `pNetwork->bssht.bdHTInfoBuf` is not NULL before accessing it. For example:
```c
if (pHTInfo->bCurrentHTSupport) {
    if (pNetwork->bssht.bdHTInfoLen != 0 && pNetwork->bssht.bdHTInfoBuf != NULL)
        pHTInfo->CurrentOpMode = ((struct ht_info_ele *)pNetwork->bssht.bdHTInfoBuf)->OptMode;
}
```
