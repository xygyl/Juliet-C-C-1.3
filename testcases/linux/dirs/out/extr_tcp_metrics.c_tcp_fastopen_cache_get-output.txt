UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The comparison `cookie->len <= 0` assumes `cookie->len` has been initialized or contains valid data. While `tfom->cookie` is copied into `*cookie`, the code does not ensure that `tfom->cookie.len` has been initialized before dereferencing it. Accessing an uninitialized variable is undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The code does not validate whether `tfom->cookie.len` contains meaningful data before use. If the value in `tfom->cookie.len` is garbage (uninitialized data), this could lead to incorrect logic or unintended behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `tfom->cookie.len` is properly initialized or check if the data in `tfom->cookie` is valid before performing any operations or assignments involving `cookie->len`. Additionally, ensure that `tfom` and its members are initialized appropriately when allocated or modified in context outside this function.
