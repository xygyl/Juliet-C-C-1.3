Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dfs_cache.c_find_cache_entry.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not perform a null check on the `path` pointer before dereferencing it (`strlen(path)` and later passing it to `cache_entry_hash`), potentially causing undefined behavior if `path` is `NULL`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `path` is `NULL`, the call to `strlen(path)` leads to undefined behavior and a crash, which could compromise the stability of the program.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null-check for `path` at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!path)
    return NULL;
```
