Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_overlay.c_sin_mul.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential for signed integer overflow when performing operations such as `factor * 4 * degrees * (180 - degrees)` or `degrees * (180 - degrees)`. The C standard defines signed integer overflow as undefined behavior. Moreover, division by zero can occur if `(40500 - degrees * (180 - degrees))` equals zero, which is another form of undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw and potential division by zero.  
Bug Reason: The expression `(40500 - degrees * (180 - degrees))` could evaluate to zero, leading to a division by zero. This happens when `degrees` is approximately 135 or another critical value that satisfies the equation. Division by zero causes the program to crash or exhibit undefined behavior. Additionally, the function does not validate `factor`, `degrees`, or the denominator for unexpected values.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add explicit checks for scenarios that result in division by zero, such as:

```c
int denominator = 40500 - degrees * (180 - degrees);
if (denominator == 0) {
    // Handle division by zero case
    return 0; // or some error value
}
```

2. Prevent signed integer overflow by ensuring `degrees` and `factor` are within valid ranges that do not cause arithmetic overflow. For example, enforce constraints on input values.
