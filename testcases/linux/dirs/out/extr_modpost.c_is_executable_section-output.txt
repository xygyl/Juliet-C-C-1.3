Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_modpost.c_is_executable_section.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing `elf->sechdrs[section_index]` when `section_index > elf->num_sections` leads to undefined behavior because it involves out-of-bounds array access. The UB occurs before the `fatal()` function is called, as the invalid memory access happens in the array subscript operation.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, Undefined behavior side effect  
Bug Reason: The check `if (section_index > elf->num_sections)` should use `>=` instead of `>`. As written, it allows access to `elf->sechdrs[elf->num_sections]`, which can exceed the bounds of the array and corrupt memory during the subsequent array dereference operation. Additionally, even though `fatal()` exits the program, UB has already occurred.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Change the conditional check from `if (section_index > elf->num_sections)` to `if (section_index >= elf->num_sections)` to ensure no out-of-bounds array access occurs, thereby avoiding UB and logical flaws.
