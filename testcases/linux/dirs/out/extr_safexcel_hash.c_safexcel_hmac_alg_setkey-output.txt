UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function has potential undefined behavior in the call to `memcmp(ctx->ipad, istate.state, state_sz)` and `memcmp(ctx->opad, ostate.state, state_sz)` if the state_sz exceeds the actual allocated storage size of `ctx->ipad` or `ctx->opad`. This would lead to out-of-bounds memory access, violating the C standard. Furthermore, if the memory pointed to by `istate.state` and `ostate.state` has not been properly initialized, accessing its contents with `memcmp` may result in undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The function risks out-of-bounds memory reads and writes in the calls to `memcmp` and `memcpy` if the `state_sz` exceeds the allocated sizes of `ctx->ipad` and `ctx->opad`. Without verifying `state_sz` against the size of these buffers, this leads to unsafe memory accesses. Additionally, potential use of uninitialized memory (`istate.state` and `ostate.state`) could result in logic errors or crashes.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Ensure that `state_sz` is validated against the actual size of `ctx->ipad` and `ctx->opad` before performing `memcmp` and `memcpy` operations. Add a bounds check condition like:
   ```c
   if (state_sz > sizeof(ctx->ipad) || state_sz > sizeof(ctx->opad)) {
       return -ENOMEM; // or another appropriate error code
   }
   ```
2. Initialize all buffers (`istate.state` and `ostate.state`) properly before using them in the function.
3. Optionally, refactor the function to include assertions for robust error handling and debugging aid if sizes are mismatched.
