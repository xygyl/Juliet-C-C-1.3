UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: `BIT_ULL(i)` assumes `i` is a valid bit position for a 64-bit integer. If `ndev->hw.se_cores` exceeds 64, `BIT_ULL(i)` will attempt to shift a 1 by an invalid number of bits, which leads to undefined behavior according to the C standard (shifting a value by a bit count greater than or equal to the width of the type invokes undefined behavior).
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The code does not validate that `ndev->hw.se_cores` is less than or equal to 64 before iterating. If `ndev->hw.se_cores > 64`, the logic of writing to `POM_PERF_CTL` with invalid shifts is incorrect, as the intended configuration cannot actually be applied to hardware with 64 or fewer cores.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `ndev->hw.se_cores` is capped to a maximum value of 64 (or the width of the integer used by `BIT_ULL`) before performing bit shifts. For example:

```c
for (i = 0; i < ndev->hw.se_cores && i < 64; i++)
    nitrox_write_csr(ndev, POM_PERF_CTL, BIT_ULL(i));
```
