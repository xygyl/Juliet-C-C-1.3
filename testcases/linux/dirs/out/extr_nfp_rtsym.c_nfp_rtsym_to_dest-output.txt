UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function avoids undefined behavior by adhering to C standard rules. For example:  
- It does not dereference invalid or null pointers.  
- Signed integer overflow is not present. The calculations on `addr` use unsigned 64-bit integers.  
- Accesses to the memory are controlled and do not appear to index out-of-bounds arrays.  
- No violations of strict aliasing rules are apparent.  
- No operations on uninitialized variables are identified within the code.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: If `sym->target < 0`, this suggests `sym->target` is signed and may cause logic errors because other cases in the function seem to expect `sym->target` to always be non-negative, as implied from encoding logic. The behavior under `sym->target < 0` might be incorrect or incomplete since it results in an error log, yet the code does not properly address negative values or validate its implications.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure the condition `sym->target < 0` is well-defined and check upstream code for valid inputs. If negative values can occur in `sym->target`, this should be explicitly handled. Possibly assert or sanitize the `sym->target` value at initialization to avoid invalid inputs reaching this function.
