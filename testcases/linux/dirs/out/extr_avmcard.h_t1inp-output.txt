UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If the `base + offset` computation results in a value that overflows the range of `unsigned int`, signed integer overflow behavior (undefined in C) could occur depending on platform implementation. Additionally, dereferencing potentially invalid I/O ports using `inb` without ensuring proper checks for validity of the input might induce undefined behavior.
