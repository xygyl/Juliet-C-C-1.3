Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_en_main.c_mlx5e_destroy_tises.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences `priv->tisn[i][tc]` without verifying that `priv->tisn` or `priv->tisn[i]` is not `NULL`. Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer results in undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `priv->tisn` or `priv->tisn[i]` is `NULL`, the dereference operation `priv->tisn[i][tc]` will lead to a runtime crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer checks for both `priv->tisn` and `priv->tisn[i]` before dereferencing them. For example:
```c
if (priv->tisn && priv->tisn[i]) {
    for (tc = 0; tc < priv->profile->max_tc; tc++) {
        mlx5e_destroy_tis(priv->mdev, priv->tisn[i][tc]);
    }
}
```
