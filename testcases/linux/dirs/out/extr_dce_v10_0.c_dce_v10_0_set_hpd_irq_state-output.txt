### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `hpd_offsets` array is being indexed using `hpd`, but there is no validation to ensure that `hpd_offsets[hpd]` is within bounds. If `hpd_offsets[]` is smaller than `adev->mode_info.num_hpd`, this can result in an out-of-bounds access, causing undefined behavior. Additionally, if `hpd_offsets[hpd]` leads to an invalid memory address, this can result in further undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: The code assumes that `hpd_offsets` has a sufficient number of entries (at least matching `adev->mode_info.num_hpd`), but this assumption is not verified. If `hpd` is valid with respect to `adev->mode_info.num_hpd` but `hpd_offsets` contains fewer elements than `adev->mode_info.num_hpd`, an out-of-bounds memory read or write occurs.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
1. Add a validation to ensure that `hpd` is less than the length of `hpd_offsets`. For example:
   ```c
   if (hpd >= adev->mode_info.num_hpd || hpd >= sizeof(hpd_offsets) / sizeof(hpd_offsets[0])) {
       DRM_DEBUG("invalid hpd %d\n", hpd);
       return -EINVAL;
   }
   ```

2. Alternatively, ensure that `hpd_offsets` is allocated such that its size is always equal to or larger than `adev->mode_info.num_hpd`.
