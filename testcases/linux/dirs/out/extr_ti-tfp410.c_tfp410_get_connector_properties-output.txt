Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_ti-tfp410.c_tfp410_get_connector_properties.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses the `PTR_ERR` macro on `dvi->hpd` to retrieve a pointer error code but later sets `dvi->hpd` to `NULL`. This may cause undefined behavior since null pointers are passed to macros expecting valid pointers (e.g., `PTR_ERR`). Additionally, the dereferencing of potentially invalid or null pointers (`connector_node->fwnode`) within the `fwnode_get_named_gpiod` function leads to potential undefined behavior if `connector_node` is not properly validated.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw, Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function assumes `connector_node` is valid after calling `of_graph_get_remote_node`, but fails to validate it before accessing `connector_node->fwnode`. If `connector_node` is `NULL`, passing it to `fwnode_get_named_gpiod` will result in a crash (null pointer dereference). Additionally, setting `dvi->hpd` to `NULL` after error checking can invalidate further error-handling logic.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `connector_node` after calling `of_graph_get_remote_node`, e.g., `if (!connector_node) return -ENODEV;`. Ensure that the `dvi->hpd` field is not set to `NULL` if the value has already been checked with `IS_ERR`. Use an explicit error-tracking variable to distinguish between error codes and success states.

Example snippet:
```c
connector_node = of_graph_get_remote_node(dvi->dev->of_node, 1, -1);
if (!connector_node)
    return -ENODEV;

if (connector_node->fwnode) {
    dvi->hpd = fwnode_get_named_gpiod(&connector_node->fwnode, "hpd-gpios", 0, GPIOD_IN, "hpd");
    if (IS_ERR(dvi->hpd)) {
        ret = PTR_ERR(dvi->hpd);
        if (ret != -ENOENT)
            goto fail;
        dvi->hpd = NULL; /* Safe to mark as NULL only after confirming error status is handled. */
    }
}
```
