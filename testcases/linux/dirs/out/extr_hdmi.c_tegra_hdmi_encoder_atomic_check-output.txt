UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The expression `crtc_state->mode.clock * 1000` can potentially cause signed integer overflow. In C, signed integer overflow invokes undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: If `crtc_state->mode.clock` has a sufficiently large value, multiplying it by 1000 could result in an integer value that exceeds the range of a signed `int`, causing an integer overflow. This would lead to incorrect calculations for `pclk`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use an unsigned type (e.g., `unsigned long`) for `clock` to eliminate the possibility of signed overflow, or add explicit overflow checks before performing the multiplication:
```c
if (crtc_state->mode.clock > INT_MAX / 1000) {
    dev_err(output->dev, "clock value causes overflow\n");
    return -EINVAL; // Return an error value
}
unsigned long pclk = (unsigned long)crtc_state->mode.clock * 1000;
```
