UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not properly check whether the `param_num` and the `param` values lead to out-of-bounds access in the `data` array. Specifically, if `param_num > 1`, this could cause unintended behavior. This may not immediately trigger undefined behavior, but it could produce problems due to misinterpreted values in `data[1]` during subsequent access within `send_pkg`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: There is a logic flaw in computing `data_type` and setting `data[1]` incorrectly when `param_num` is not validated to be strictly 1 or 0. Additionally, if the `sender` pointer is null, the DRM_ERROR macro is called to log an error, but the function proceeds normally, which might hide bugs upon checking procedurally conservatu errno-handling
BUG Caused=dictEnumeratio_assertive!
