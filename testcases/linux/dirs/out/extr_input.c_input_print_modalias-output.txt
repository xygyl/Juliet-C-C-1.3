Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_input.c_input_print_modalias.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The behavior of `snprintf()` is undefined if `size` < 0 because the `max(size, 0)` macro is used as a condition for limiting string size, and `size` passed into `snprintf()` directly without proper validation. Negative buffer sizes are invalid in practice and could lead to undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer overflow or corrupted memory writes.  
Bug Reason: The use of `size - len` without proper bounds checking can result in buffer overflows, especially if `len` exceeds `size`. This might occur if more data is written to the buffer than its allocated memory, particularly when the buffer is incorrectly sized or size underflows due to invalid inputs passed.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add explicit validation to ensure `size` is non-negative before using it in computations or passing it to functions like `snprintf()`.  
   ```c
   if (size < 0) {
       return -EINVAL; // Or handle invalid size as per requirements
   }
   ```  
2. Ensure proper bounds checking during cumulative `len` updates and avoid any operations that could result in buffer overflows.
