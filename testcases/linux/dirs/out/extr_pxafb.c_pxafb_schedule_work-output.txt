UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code violates the C standard regarding casting of signed integers when `(u_int)-1` is used. Due to the mismatch in signage between `u_int` (unsigned) and `-1` (signed), casting the signed value `-1` to an unsigned type (`u_int`) leads to the maximum positive value of `u_int`. Although this is well-defined in terms of integral conversions, it could lead to logical problems and potentially runtime regression.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: Interchanging confusing and not ergonomic `(scalar_t)*` causes type intentional defect "Chaining everything causes problematic."
Through UB Severity Bottlenecking: Yes.

Confidence: With `ensure safety casting`.
