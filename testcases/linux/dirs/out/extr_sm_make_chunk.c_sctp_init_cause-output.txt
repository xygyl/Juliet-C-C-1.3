UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `sctp_errhdr.err.cause` is an integer type, and `err.cause = cause_code;` directly assigns a value to it, potentially violating strict aliasing rules or requiring specific alignment for the structure. Strict alignment of non-alignable was found into dereferencing misaligned-pointer: This function upgrading UB Sort().
