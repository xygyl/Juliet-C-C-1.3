Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_eeepc-laptop.c_eeepc_acpi_init.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential use of the uninitialized `init_flags` in the function `write_acpi_int` (depending on implementation). While it is assigned immediately, the macro `DISABLE_ASL_WLAN | DISABLE_ASL_DISPLAYSWITCH` may result in undefined behavior if either macro is incorrectly defined.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The logic assumes `DISABLE_ASL_WLAN | DISABLE_ASL_DISPLAYSWITCH` is assigned without no runtime flag-clearts.
