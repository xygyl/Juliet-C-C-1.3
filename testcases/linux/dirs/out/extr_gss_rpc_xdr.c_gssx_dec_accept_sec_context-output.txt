### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential dereference of uninitialized pointer `res->context_handle` or `res->output_token`. If `gssx_dec_ctx()` or `gssx_dec_buffer()` is executed but fails (`err != 0`), the respective field (`context_handle` or `output_token`) is not guaranteed to have been initialized properly before the function exits. Consequently, a caller may attempt to use these fields, resulting in undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: Although `res->context_handle` and `res->output_token` are set to `NULL` when `value_follows == false`, there is no explicit reset for these fields when `value_follows == true` but their decoding fails (`err != 0`). If the caller does not check the return code or relies on these pointers being non‐NULL, unintended dereferencing of uninitialized pointers can cause memory access errors.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `res->context_handle` and `res->output_token` are explicitly set to `NULL` before attempting to decode them with `gssx_dec_ctx()` and `gssx_dec_buffer()`. For example:  

```c
if (value_follows) {
    res->context_handle = NULL;  // Explicit initialization
    err = gssx_dec_ctx(xdr, res->context_handle);
    if (err)
        goto out_free;
}
```

Additionally, validate the success of buffer allocations and external operations to mitigate the risk of UB and bugs stemming from failed initializations.
