UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: In the call to `snprintf`, `PAGE_SIZE` is used as the size argument, but `PAGE_SIZE` is a macro representing a page size (typically 4096 bytes or similar on many systems). The output buffer `buf` may not be guaranteed to be of this size, and if `buf` is smaller than `PAGE_SIZE`, this can result in a buffer overflow, which leads to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that the `buf` argument is sufficiently large (at least `PAGE_SIZE`), but this assumption is not guaranteed or enforced by the function. If the `buf` argument is smaller than this size, writing to or beyond its boundaries could corrupt memory or cause a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Check that the size of the `buf` is explicitly passed to the function or dynamically verified before the use of `snprintf`. Alternatively, reduce the size passed to `snprintf` to the actual size of `buf` if known or documented to be smaller than `PAGE_SIZE`. For example:
```c
size_t buf_size = <actual buffer size>;
return snprintf(buf, buf_size, "%d\n", max_rpm);
```
