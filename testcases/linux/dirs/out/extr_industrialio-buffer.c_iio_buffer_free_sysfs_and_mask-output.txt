### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not perform any operations that violate the C standard. All pointer dereferences are conditional on `indio_dev->buffer`, which ensures they are not null before accessing. Standard memory deallocation functions (`bitmap_free`, `kfree`, and `iio_free_chan_devattr_list`) are used, and no undefined behavior arises from signed arithmetic or bit manipulations.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw (possible double-free or unexpected behavior)
Bug Reason:  
- The function may attempt to free memory incorrectly if the `attrs` fields within `buffer_group` or `scan_el_group` were not allocated or previously freed elsewhere. If these fields contain invalid pointers or `NULL`, `kfree` behavior may vary or lead to errors in memory management.
- There is no distinction made for the validity of `indio_dev->buffer->scan_mask`, `buffer_group.attrs`, `scan_el_group.attrs`, or `scan_el_dev_attr_list` before calling their respective free functions. This logic flaw could lead to freeing invalid pointers if values were never allocated or if other parts of the code already freed these resources.

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
- Validate that `indio_dev->buffer->scan_mask`, `buffer_group.attrs`, `scan_el_group.attrs`, and `scan_el_dev_attr_list` are non-null and appropriately allocated before calling their respective free functions. Example:
```c
if (indio_dev->buffer->scan_mask)
    bitmap_free(indio_dev->buffer->scan_mask);
if (indio_dev->buffer->buffer_group.attrs)
    kfree(indio_dev->buffer->buffer_group.attrs);
if (indio_dev->buffer->scan_el_group.attrs)
    kfree(indio_dev->buffer->scan_el_group.attrs);
if (&indio_dev->buffer->scan_el_dev_attr_list)
    iio_free_chan_devattr_list(&indio_dev->buffer->scan_el_dev_attr_list);
```
- Additionally, introduce a flag or mechanism to track whether these resources are allocated to avoid double frees.
