UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The variable `rhs` is used uninitialized when passed to `get_op(&rhs)`. Using uninitialized variables is undefined behavior according to the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Uninitialized Variable
Bug Reason: The variable `rhs` is uninitialized before being passed to the `get_op` function. This leads to undefined behavior and introduces potential logic errors if `rhs` is expected to hold meaningful data.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `rhs` is properly initialized before calling `get_op(&rhs)`, either by assigning it a default value or ensuring `get_op` itself initializes `rhs` appropriately.
