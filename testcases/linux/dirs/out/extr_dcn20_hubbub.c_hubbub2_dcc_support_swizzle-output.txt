UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences the pointers `segment_order_horz` and `segment_order_vert` directly without any null pointer check, which could lead to undefined behavior if null pointers are passed.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `segment_order_horz` or `segment_order_vert` are null, the direct assignment to `*segment_order_horz` or `*segment_order_vert` will result in a null pointer dereference. This is a logical error that assumes the pointers are always valid.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer checks for both `segment_order_horz` and `segment_order_vert` at the start of the function. For example:
```c
if (segment_order_horz == NULL || segment_order_vert == NULL) {
    return false;
}
```
Additionally, clarify in the documentation or usage that non-null pointers must be passed to ensure correctness.
