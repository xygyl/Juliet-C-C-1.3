Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sysfs.c_alloc_hsa.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The line `hsa->attr.name = (char *)name;` performs an unsafe cast from `const char *` to `char *`. This violates the C standard as it allows a `const` value to be modified, which results in undefined behavior if that modification is attempted. Additionally, this type of cast circumvents any compiler protections that ensure the integrity of `const` designations.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Pointer cast / logical flaw
Bug Reason: Casting `const char *` to `char *` results in a type mismatch, potentially leading to accidental modification of `name` if it's treated as a non-const `char *` later in the program. Even if no modification occurs, this logic creates the potential for future runtime bugs, as the intent for `name` is unclear due to this cast.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Do not cast `const char *` to `char *`. Update the type of `attr.name` in the `struct attribute` definition to `const char *` to maintain const correctness.

Example fix:
```c
struct attribute {
    const char *name; // Change 'char *' to 'const char *'
    u8 mode;
};

// Update line in function:
hsa->attr.name = name; // Safe assignment as both are const char *
```
