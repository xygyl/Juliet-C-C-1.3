UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not perform any operations that are undefined according to the C standard. All memory and pointer operations appear valid, and there is no evidence of out-of-bounds access, signed integer overflow, or null pointer dereferences.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Leak  
Bug Reason: In the case that `dup_to_netobj` succeeds but `rsc_lookup` fails and returns NULL, the resources allocated in `dup_to_netobj` for `rsci.handle` are not properly freed before the function returns NULL. This results in a memory leak.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the allocated resources in `rsci.handle` are freed in case `rsc_lookup` returns NULL. This can be done by moving the call to `rsc_free(&rsci)` above the NULL check for `found`, ensuring resources allocated during `dup_to_netobj` are cleaned up properly.

Corrected code snippet:
```c
if (dup_to_netobj(&rsci.handle, handle->data, handle->len))
    return NULL;

found = rsc_lookup(cd, &rsci);
rsc_free(&rsci);  // Cleanup rsci.handle even if rsc_lookup fails.

if (!found)
    return NULL;

if (cache_check(cd, &found->h, NULL))
    return NULL;

return found;
```
