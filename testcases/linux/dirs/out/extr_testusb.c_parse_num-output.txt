### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain undefined behavior. The use of `strtoul`, pointer handling, and comparisons are all conforming to the C standard. The function checks for errors properly (`errno` and `*end`) and avoids any operations on undefined values or memory locations.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw and integer overflow  
Bug Reason: 
1. **Logic Flaw**: The function incorrectly handles cases where `errno` becomes non-zero due to previous operations outside this function. `errno` is not guaranteed to be reset to zero before calling `strtoul`, which can cause false positives when checking `errno`.
2. **Integer Overflow/Truncation**: The conversion of `unsigned long` to `unsigned` (when assigning `val` to `*num`) is unchecked. If `val` is larger than the maximum value of `unsigned`, it performs silent truncation, which changes the resultant value in `*num`.

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion: 
1. Reset `errno` to zero explicitly before calling `strtoul` to ensure that any leftover errors do not propagate:  
   ```c
   errno = 0;
   val = strtoul(str, &end, 0);
   ```
2. Add a range check for `val` to ensure it fits into an `unsigned` without truncation:  
   ```c
   if (val > (unsigned long)UINT_MAX)
       return -1;
   ```

Updated Code:
```c
static int parse_num(unsigned *num, const char *str)
{
    unsigned long val;
    char *end;

    errno = 0; // Reset errno
    val = strtoul(str, &end, 0);
    if (errno || *end || val > (unsigned long)UINT_MAX) // Check range properly
        return -1;
    *num = (unsigned)val; // Safe conversion
    return 0;
}
```
