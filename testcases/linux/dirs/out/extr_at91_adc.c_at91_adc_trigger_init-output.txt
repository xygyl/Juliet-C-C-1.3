UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer `i` is used uninitialized during the rollback loop (`for (i--; i >= 0; i--)`) in the `error_trigger` block. If allocation fails for the first trigger (`st->trig[0]`), `i` will have a value of -1, causing an invalid loop condition and potentially leading to undefined behavior such as out-of-bounds memory access or dereference.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: Incorrect rollback mechanism in the error handling section leads to the possibility of attempting to unregister and free uninitialized or NULL pointers in the array `st->trig`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Initialize `i` correctly before entering the rollback loop. Replace the rollback loop condition with a check to ensure `i >= 0` and only free triggers that were successfully allocated. Modifying the rollback loop to handle failures more robustly is recommended.

Corrected code snippet:
```c
error_trigger:
	for (; i >= 0; i--) {
		if (st->trig[i]) {
			iio_trigger_unregister(st->trig[i]);
			iio_trigger_free(st->trig[i]);
		}
	}
error_ret:
	return ret;
```
This fix ensures that only valid pointers in `st->trig` are freed and avoids relying on `i--` without explicitly setting `i` to a valid state.
