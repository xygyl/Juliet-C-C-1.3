UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not verify whether the `val` parameter is within the expected range. Specifically, if `val` has a value that is neither `4` nor an expected value for shifting and encoding (e.g., negative values or excessively large values), this could lead to undefined behavior due to improper bit manipulation.

Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: N/A
Bug Reason: Assuming `val` is within the expected range (e.g., `4` or values that properly map into `edge`), there is no memory-related or logic-related bug in the code. The bitwise operations are performed correctly.

Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add parameter validation to ensure `val` is within the expected range before performing bit manipulation. For instance:

```c
if (val != 4 && (val < 1 || val > 3)) {
    // Handle unexpected values (e.g., return an error code or log an error)
    return -1; // Example error code
}
```
