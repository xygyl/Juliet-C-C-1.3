UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Dereferencing `first_cpu_in_pkg[pkg]` without verifying that `pkg` is within bounds of the array. If `pkg` is out of bounds, undefined behavior will occur due to reading invalid memory.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access
Bug Reason: The function does not perform bounds checking on `pkg` before accessing `first_cpu_in_pkg[pkg]`, which could lead to an out-of-bounds access.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking to ensure `pkg` is within the valid range (e.g., `if (pkg < 0 || pkg >= MAX_PACKAGES)` where `MAX_PACKAGES` represents the size of the `first_cpu_in_pkg` array).
