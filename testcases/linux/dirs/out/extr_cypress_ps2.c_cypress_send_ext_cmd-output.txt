UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code passes the `param` pointer multiple times to functions without verifying whether or not it is `NULL`. If `param` is null, dereferencing it in the called functions or during its usage would cause undefined behavior due to null pointer dereferencing.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If the input parameter `param` is null and the functions `cypress_ps2_read_cmd_status` or `cypress_verify_cmd_state` attempt to dereference the pointer, it would result in a null pointer dereference, causing a runtime error.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `param` early in the function. For example:
```c
if (param == NULL) {
    return -EIO; // Or handle the null case explicitly
}
```
Optional: Clearly document the behavior of the function when handling null inputs. If null `param` is valid, ensure downstream logic respects this.
