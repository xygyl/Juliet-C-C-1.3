UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `of_get_address()` function is assumed to return valid and non-NULL pointers without verification. If `addr` is NULL, dereferencing it with `be32_to_cpup(addr)` will result in undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The `addr` variable obtained from `of_get_address()` is dereferenced with `be32_to_cpup(addr)` without checking if it is NULL. If `of_get_address()` fails to find the address, this will result in a null pointer dereference and cause a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL check for the `addr` variable obtained from `of_get_address()`. For instance:
```c
addr = of_get_address(dev->of_node, 1, NULL, NULL);
if (!addr) {
    dev_err(dev, "Failed to get address from DT\n");
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
