Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_crc8.c_crc8_populate_msb.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The loop `for (i = 1; i < CRC8_TABLE_SIZE; i *= 2)` risks indefinite undefined behavior if `CRC8_TABLE_SIZE` is insufficiently large, as integer bounds may be exceeded depending on its size. Specifically, an integer overflow is possible because `i *= 2` repeatedly multiplies `i`. According to the C standard, signed integer overflow causes undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: The logic of incrementing `i` using `i *= 2` without bounds checking could lead to an integer overflow if `CRC8_TABLE_SIZE` is very large and `i` is of type `int`. As the code multiplies `i` repeatedly, it may exceed the maximum value of a signed integer, potentially wrapping around or producing incorrect results.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Consider changing the type of `i` to `unsigned int`, `size_t`, or ensure that `CRC8_TABLE_SIZE` is small enough to safely fit within the bounds of `int` when multiplied repeatedly. Additionally, include a check to ensure `i` does not exceed the maximum allowable value for its type before multiplication.
