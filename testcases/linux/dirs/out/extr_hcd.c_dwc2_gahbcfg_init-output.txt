UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The expression `hsotg->params.ahbcfg != -1` compares a signed constant (`-1`) against an `unsigned` type (likely `u32`). This results in undefined behavior due to type mismatch and potential integer conversion issues, as negative values cannot be represented in an unsigned type.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The integer comparison logic may fail due to the unsigned nature of `hsotg->params.ahbcfg`. For an unsigned type, the comparison `!= -1` is logically incorrect, as `-1` cannot be correctly represented and compared. As a result, unintended behavior could occur during configuration updates.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `params.ahbcfg` is explicitly defined in a signed type (e.g., `int`) if the intention is to use negative values as special cases. Alternatively, if it must remain unsigned, replace the comparison logic to properly check for the intended case, such as using a specific unsigned flag value instead of `-1`.

Example fix:
```c
if ((int)hsotg->params.ahbcfg != -1) {  // Cast to ensure valid comparison
    ahbcfg &= GAHBCFG_CTRL_MASK;
    ahbcfg |= hsotg->params.ahbcfg & ~GAHBCFG_CTRL_MASK;
}
```
Alternatively:
```c
#define INVALID_AHBCFG 0xFFFFFFFF  // Define a special unsigned marker value
if (hsotg->params.ahbcfg != INVALID_AHBCFG) {
    ahbcfg &= GAHBCFG_CTRL_MASK;
    ahbcfg |= hsotg->params.ahbcfg & ~GAHBCFG_CTRL_MASK;
}
```
