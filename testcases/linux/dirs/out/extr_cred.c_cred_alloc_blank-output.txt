Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cred.c_cred_alloc_blank.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: `abort_creds(new)` dereferences the `new` pointer without ensuring that it is in a valid state. This invokes undefined behavior if the `kmem_cache_zalloc()` function failed to adequately initialize the allocated memory. Additionally, if `security_cred_alloc_blank(new, GFP_KERNEL)` modifies the internal state of the `cred` structure arbitrarily (and negatively), the use of the `new` pointer afterward could also introduce UB. Specific details about `abort_creds` implementation might confirm this further.
  
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Management Bug
Bug Reason: Call to `kmem_cache_zalloc` does not perform error checking around memory allocation internals, so improper allocation can return corrupted memory, and this could lead to errors when calling `abort_creds` on such a corrupted pointer in the error path. Furthermore, security functionality (`security_cred_alloc_blank`) failure does not guarantee safety for `abort_creds`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Perform more robust validation of memory allocation and the state of the `new` pointer before invoking `abort_creds`. Ensure that `security_cred_alloc_blank`'s failure leaves the `new` structure in a safe state capable of being freed. Add checks for memory corruption or invalid pointer states before calling `abort_creds`.
