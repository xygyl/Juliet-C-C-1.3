Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pinctrl-meson.c_meson_pinconf_group_set.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The variable `num_group` is used to index the `pc->data->groups` array without any bounds check. If `num_group` exceeds the number of available groups, accessing `pc->data->groups[num_group]` results in out-of-bounds memory access, which triggers undefined behavior. The specific number of groups available is not validated.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access
Bug Reason: Using `num_group` directly without validating its bounds can access illegal memory, which may crash the program or corrupt memory. Additionally, this bug relies upon undefined behavior caused by out-of-bounds access.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check for `num_group`. Ensure that it is within the valid range of groups, typically between `0` and `(total_group_count - 1)`:

```c
if (num_group >= total_group_count) {
    return -EINVAL;  // Return appropriate error code if out-of-bounds.
}
```
