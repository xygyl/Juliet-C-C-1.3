UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is possible undefined behavior due to dereferencing an invalid pointer if `sd` is NULL when passed into the `to_state()` macro. The dereference happens when accessing `state->video_enable`. If `sd` is NULL, the program violates the C standard on null pointer dereferencing.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: If `sd` is NULL and passed to the `to_state()` macro and subsequently dereferenced, this will result in undefined behavior and could lead to a crash or other unexpected behavior. There is insufficient validation of the `sd` pointer before dereferencing it.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL check for `sd` before dereferencing it, e.g., `if (!sd) return -EINVAL;`.
