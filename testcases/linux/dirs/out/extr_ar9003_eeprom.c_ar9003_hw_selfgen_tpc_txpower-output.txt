### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `pwr_array` is not initialized properly or does not contain a valid size, the function could dereference uninitialized or out-of-bounds elements of `pwr_array` (e.g., `pwr_array[ALL_TARGET_LEGACY_1L_5L]` or `pwr_array[ALL_TARGET_LEGACY_6_24]`). Additionally, the values used in `SM()` are not checked for validity, and passing invalid values could lead to undefined behavior if the macro is implemented in a way that does not handle all cases.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory/Logic Issue (Out-of-Bounds Access)  
Bug Reason: The function does not verify whether `pwr_array` is properly initialized or its size is sufficient to include the required indices (`ALL_TARGET_LEGACY_1L_5L` and `ALL_TARGET_LEGACY_6_24`). This could lead to an out-of-bounds access of the array, causing memory corruption or crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Add validation to ensure that `pwr_array` is properly initialized and contains enough elements for the function to safely access `pwr_array[ALL_TARGET_LEGACY_1L_5L]` and `pwr_array[ALL_TARGET_LEGACY_6_24]`.  
2. Ensure that `ALL_TARGET_LEGACY_1L_5L` and `ALL_TARGET_LEGACY_6_24` are within the bounds of the `pwr_array` size. If not, return an error or handle the case appropriately.  
3. Optionally, verify the validity of values passed to `SM()`.

Example addition to the function:
```c
if (pwr_array == NULL || 
    ALL_TARGET_LEGACY_1L_5L >= array_size || 
    ALL_TARGET_LEGACY_6_24 >= array_size) {
    /* Handle error: Invalid input */
    return;
}
```
