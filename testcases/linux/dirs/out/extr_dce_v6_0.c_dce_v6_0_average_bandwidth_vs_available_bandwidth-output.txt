UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Division by zero is possible if `wm->num_heads` is zero, invoking undefined behavior according to the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Bug
Bug Reason: The logic assumes that `wm->num_heads` will always be a non-zero value. If `wm->num_heads` is zero, the division leads to undefined behavior and may cause a runtime crash or incorrect results due to division by zero. Furthermore, no sanity checks are done to ensure valid inputs for the `struct dce6_wm_params`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check before performing the division to ensure `wm->num_heads` is not zero. For example:

```c
if (wm->num_heads == 0) {
    // handle error case, e.g., return false or log an error
    return false;
}
if (dce_v6_0_average_bandwidth(wm) <=
    (dce_v6_0_available_bandwidth(wm) / wm->num_heads))
    return true;
else
    return false;
```
