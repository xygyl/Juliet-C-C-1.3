Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_paes_s390.c_ecb_paes_crypt.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `cpacf_km` function is invoked with `walk->dst.virt.addr` and `walk->src.virt.addr`, which are potentially unaligned for block cipher operations. If the hardware instruction `cpacf_km` requires specific memory alignment and these pointers are not properly aligned, it might lead to undefined behavior according to the C standard, as misaligned memory access is UB.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Misaligned Memory Access
Bug Reason: There is no guarantee that `walk->dst.virt.addr` or `walk->src.virt.addr` is correctly aligned for the `cpacf_km` instruction, which could lead to runtime exceptions or cryptographic operation errors on some architectures.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Validate that `walk->dst.virt.addr` and `walk->src.virt.addr` pointers are aligned to the required boundary (likely 16 or 32 bytes for AES). Use alignment macros or functions to ensure proper alignment before passing these pointers to `cpacf_km`. Alternatively, copy data to a temporary buffer that is aligned.
