Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_verbs.c_ib_create_rwq_ind_table.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code does not perform sufficient validation of the value `log_ind_tbl_size` before using it to calculate `table_size` with `(1 << init_attr->log_ind_tbl_size)`. If `log_ind_tbl_size` exceeds the width of an `int`, this will lead to undefined behavior due to a shift operation exceeding the width of the type.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access
Bug Reason: The loop iterating over `atomic_inc(&rwq_ind_table->ind_tbl[i]->usecnt)` assumes that `ind_tbl` is a valid array of size `table_size`. If `ind_tbl` is NULL or does not contain enough elements, this can cause memory access outside of valid bounds, leading to potential crashes or corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate the inputs: Check that `log_ind_tbl_size` is within a safe range (e.g., 0 â‰¤ `log_ind_tbl_size` < `sizeof(u32) * 8`). Additionally, ensure `ind_tbl` is not NULL and has at least `table_size` elements before accessing its members.
