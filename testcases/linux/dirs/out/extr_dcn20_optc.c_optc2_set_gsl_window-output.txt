UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function does not contain operations that lead to undefined behavior per the C standard. All pointer dereferences appear valid, provided that the `params` pointer is correctly initialized and not NULL when passed in. Signed integer overflow or other forms of UB are not present.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether `params` is NULL before attempting to dereference its members (`params->gsl_window_start_x`, `params->gsl_window_end_x`, etc.). If `params` is NULL, this would lead to a null pointer dereference bug.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL pointer check for `params` at the beginning of the function to ensure it is a valid pointer:

```c
if (params == NULL) {
    return; // or handle the error appropriately
}
```
