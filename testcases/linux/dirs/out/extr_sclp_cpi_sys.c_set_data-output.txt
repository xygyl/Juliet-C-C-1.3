Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sclp_cpi_sys.c_set_data.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not verify that `strlen(data)` is less than or equal to `CPI_LENGTH_NAME`. Without this validation, `memcpy(field, data, strlen(data))` may perform an out-of-bounds write if `data` is longer than `field` (defined with `CPI_LENGTH_NAME` size). This can cause undefined behavior as per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: As described in the UB analysis, `strlen(data)` being greater than `CPI_LENGTH_NAME` can lead to a buffer overflow when copying `data` to `field`. This corrupts memory and may cause unpredictable program behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate `strlen(data)` against `CPI_LENGTH_NAME` before calling `memcpy`. Example modification:
```c
size_t data_len = strlen(data);
if (data_len > CPI_LENGTH_NAME) {
    data_len = CPI_LENGTH_NAME;  // Limit to the size of `field`.
}
memcpy(field, data, data_len);
```
