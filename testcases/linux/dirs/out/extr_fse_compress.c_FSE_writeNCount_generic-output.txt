### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Signed integer overflow**: The expression `bitStream += count << bitCount` can overflow if `count << bitCount` exceeds the range of `U32`. While the variable `bitStream` is declared as `U32`, there is no guarantee that `bitCount` (an `int`) remains within safe bounds where the shift leads to valid results. The C standard specifies that signed integer overflow results in undefined behavior.  
2. **Accessing invalid `normalizedCounter[charnum]`:** `charnum` is incremented inside loops without bounds being explicitly checked against `maxSymbolValue`. If `charnum` exceeds its valid range, it could result in out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior.  
3. **Use of uninitialized values**: `remaining` is decremented based on the value of `normalizedCounter[charnum++]`. If `normalizedCounter[charnum]` contains uninitialized data, accessing its value indirectly causes undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason:  
The function attempts to write data to the output buffer `header` (`BYTE *const ostart` and `BYTE *const oend`). Specifically:
1. If the `writeIsSafe` flag is `0`, the function evaluates conditions such as `out > oend - 2`, but fails to prevent buffer overflows in cases where `bitCount` results in excessively large writes.
2. During the while-loops for encoding data (e.g., the main `while (remaining > 1)` loop and nested sections within), no guaranteed bounds check is performed for the `out` pointer to ensure it does not exceed `oend`. For example:
   - `out[0] = (BYTE)bitStream;`
   - `out[1] = (BYTE)(bitStream >> 8);`
   Depending on `bitCount` calculations and buffer size constraints, this can overwrite memory outside of `header`, causing a buffer overflow.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion  
1. Introduce strict bounds-checking to validate that every write operation stays within the `header` buffer's size (`headerBufferSize`). Consider explicitly calculating the space required before performing writes, especially for multi-byte writes like `out[0]` and `out[1]`.  
2. Ensure `charnum` is bounded by a maximum value (`maxSymbolValue + 1`) **before accessing `normalizedCounter[charnum]`** to ensure it doesn't result in out-of-bounds access.  
3. Guard against potential overflow in `bitStream` and `bitCount`. For shifts (`count << bitCount`), ensure that `bitCount` remains within a valid range that won't cause overflows.  

Additionally, consider initializing all variables (especially arrays like `normalizedCounter`) properly before usage to ensure stability.
