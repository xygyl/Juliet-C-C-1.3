Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mtk_vpu.c_vpu_free_ext_mem.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: `fw_type` is used as an index (`vpu->extmem[fw_type]`) without any bounds-checking, which could lead to an out-of-bounds array access if `fw_type` has an invalid value. Accessing array elements out-of-bounds is undefined behavior in C as it accesses memory outside the allocated area.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: `fw_type` is not validated to ensure it is a valid index within the bounds of the `extmem` array before usage. If `fw_type` exceeds the bounds of the array or is negative, this could lead to memory corruption or crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds-check for `fw_type` before accessing `vpu->extmem[fw_type]`. For example:
```c
if (fw_type < 0 || fw_type >= ARRAY_SIZE(vpu->extmem)) {
    // Handle error appropriately, such as logging and returning
    return;
}
```
