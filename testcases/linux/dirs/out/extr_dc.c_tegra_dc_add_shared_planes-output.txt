### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain operations typically associated with undefined behavior as per the C standard. There are no instances of signed integer overflows, null or invalid pointer dereferences, strict aliasing rule violations, nor uninitialized variable access. Memory access appears to be within bounds, and pointer operations follow expected rules.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The `primary` plane selection logic may result in missed edge cases. The function chooses the first shared plane as the primary unconditionally (`if (!primary)`), without verifying additional requirements or ensuring that the first plane is truly suitable as primary. This could lead to unintended behavior if external constraints exist on selecting the primary planes (e.g., policy requiring certain capabilities or priority rules). While this may not cause immediate issues within the function, it risks producing invalid or incorrect plane assignments downstream in caller code.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  

### Fix Suggestion
1. Add validation to ensure that the first plane selected as `DRM_PLANE_TYPE_PRIMARY` meets additional criteria (e.g., capability checks, priority considerations).
2. Document any assumptions about the selection of the primary plane explicitly in the code to ensure alignment with external policies.
