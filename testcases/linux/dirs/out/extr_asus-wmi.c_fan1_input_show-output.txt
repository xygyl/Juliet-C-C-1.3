UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `value < 0 ? -1 : value*100` expression in the return statement involves a possible signed integer overflow when `value*100` exceeds the range of `int`. Signed integer overflow in C results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: Signed integer overflow can occur when `value*100` exceeds the range of a signed `int`, resulting in undefined behavior. Furthermore, the logic does not account for the possibility of `value` being an uninitialized variable, as there is no guarantee that `value` is assigned in case of failure paths.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Use a larger `datatype` such as `long long int` for `value` or explicitly check for potential overflow before performing the multiplication.  
2. Initialize `value` to a known default value (e.g., 0) to ensure it is not used uninitialized in failure cases.  
3. Add bounds checking and proper error propagation to safeguard multiplication and make failure handling well-defined.  

Example Fix:
```c
long long value_ll;
...
// Replace 'value' type to long long and validate range before multiplication.
return sprintf(buf, "%lld\n", value_ll < 0 ? -1 : (value_ll > INT_MAX / 100) ? -1 : value_ll * 100);
```
