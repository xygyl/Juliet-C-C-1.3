UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing a potentially null pointer (`info`) without a prior validity check. This would trigger undefined behavior if `info` is passed as `NULL`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `info` is passed as `NULL`, accessing `info->version` would result in a null pointer dereference. This is a logic bug arising from the assumption that `info` is always valid.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a null-pointer check for `info` at the beginning of the function, such as:  
```c
if (info == NULL) {
    /* Handle error case, e.g., return a default value or an error code */
    return 0; // Assuming 0 is a sensible fallback version value
}
```  
This ensures the function gracefully handles the case where `info` is null, avoiding undefined behavior and null-pointer dereference.
