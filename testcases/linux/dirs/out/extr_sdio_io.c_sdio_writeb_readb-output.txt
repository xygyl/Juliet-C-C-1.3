### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `err_ret` is dereferenced without verification that it is not NULL. If the caller passes a NULL pointer for `err_ret`, writing to `*err_ret = ret;` will result in undefined behavior because dereferencing a NULL pointer is explicitly undefined.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes `err_ret` is a valid pointer without checking if it is NULL before dereferencing it. Passing NULL for `err_ret` would result in a crash or undefined behavior.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Before dereferencing `err_ret`, validate that it is not NULL. Add the following check:  
```c
if (err_ret) {
    *err_ret = ret;
}
```  
This ensures the function behaves correctly even if `err_ret` is NULL. The function would simply not update any error code when provided with a NULL pointer.
