UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing `sprom[words - 1]` without ensuring that `words` is greater than 0 results in undefined behavior because `words - 1` can underflow and index out of bounds. This is undefined behavior according to the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds Access
Bug Reason: If `words == 0`, accessing `sprom[words - 1]` leads to an out-of-bounds memory access, a potential segmentation fault or memory corruption. The logic assumes `words` is always positive but does not enforce this precondition.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: Add a validation check at the beginning of the function to ensure that `words > 0`. For example:
```c
if (words == 0)
    return -EPROTO;
```
This will prevent any underflow and incorrect access to the last element of the `sprom` array.
