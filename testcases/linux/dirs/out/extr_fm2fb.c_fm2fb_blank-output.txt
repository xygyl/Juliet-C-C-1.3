### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior due to accessing or modifying a global pointer `fm2fb_reg` without validation. If `fm2fb_reg` is `NULL` (or points to invalid memory), writing to `fm2fb_reg[0]` would result in undefined behavior. Additionally, the function assumes `blank` and `fm2fb_reg` are always valid without verifying them.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `fm2fb_reg` is `NULL` or points to invalid memory, dereferencing `fm2fb_reg[0]` will cause a crash. This null pointer dereference is a form of memory-related bug.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Add a check to ensure `fm2fb_reg` is not `NULL` or invalid before attempting to dereference it. The fixed code could look like this:
```c
if (fm2fb_reg == NULL) {
    // Handle error appropriately, such as returning an error code
    return -1;
}
fm2fb_reg[0] = t;
```  
Additionally, validate `blank` or other inputs to ensure correctness if there are specifications regarding valid ranges.
