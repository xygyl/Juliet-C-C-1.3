UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `malloc()` call is immediately followed by a `memset()` operation without checking whether the `malloc()` returned `NULL`. If `malloc()` fails and returns `NULL`, the behavior of `memset(NULL, ..., ...)` is undefined by the C standard because it attempts to dereference a null pointer.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The logic flaw arises from invoking `memset()` without verifying that the allocation succeeded. If `malloc()` returns `NULL` due to memory allocation failure, applying `memset()` will lead to undefined behavior as it would operate on a null pointer.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check after the `malloc()` call to verify that `array` is not `NULL` before proceeding to the `memset()` call. Example:  
```c
array = malloc(size);
if (!array) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Mem alloc error (nr_cpus:%u)\n", nr_cpus);
    exit(EXIT_FAIL_MEM);
}
memset(array, 0, size);
```
