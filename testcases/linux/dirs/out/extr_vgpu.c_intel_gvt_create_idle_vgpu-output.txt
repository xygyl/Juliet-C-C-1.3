Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vgpu.c_intel_gvt_create_idle_vgpu.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code accesses `vgpu->submission.workload_q_head[i]` in a loop from 0 to `I915_NUM_ENGINES`. However, `workload_q_head` is defined as a pointer (`int *workload_q_head`) but not initialized or allocated, meaning it can dereference an uninitialized or invalid memory address, causing undefined behavior when used with `INIT_LIST_HEAD()`.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related (Invalid Memory Access)
Bug Reason: The `workload_q_head` pointer is not properly initialized, potentially leading to dereferencing of invalid addresses during `INIT_LIST_HEAD(&vgpu->submission.workload_q_head[i])`. This may result in a crash or corrupted memory.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before looping over `I915_NUM_ENGINES`, ensure `workload_q_head` points to valid allocated memory:
```c
vgpu->submission.workload_q_head = vzalloc(I915_NUM_ENGINES * sizeof(*vgpu->submission.workload_q_head));
if (!vgpu->submission.workload_q_head)
    goto out_free_vgpu;
```
Additionally, free this memory in the `out_free_vgpu` cleanup path:
```c
vfree(vgpu->submission.workload_q_head);
```
