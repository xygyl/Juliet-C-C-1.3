UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is potential for undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer. Specifically, `old_conn_state->connector` is passed to `to_intel_connector()`, and `connector->base.dev` is dereferenced in `to_i915(connector->base.dev)` without a null check. If `old_conn_state` or its `connector` member is `NULL`, this will lead to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `old_conn_state`, `old_conn_state->connector`, or `connector->base.dev` is `NULL`, the function will attempt to dereference a null pointer, causing a crash. Similarly, `old_conn_state->crtc` is accessed without a null check before being processed in `to_intel_crtc()`. This could also potentially lead to a null pointer dereference.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add null checks for `old_conn_state`, `old_conn_state->connector`, and `old_conn_state->crtc` before dereferencing them. For example:  
```c
if (!old_conn_state || !old_conn_state->connector || !old_conn_state->crtc)
    return;
```  
This way, the function gracefully handles any potentially null inputs and avoids undefined behavior or crashes.
