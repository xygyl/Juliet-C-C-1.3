Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_txrx.c_aggr_module_destroy.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential double-free risk due to not nullifying freed pointers. The `aggr_info->aggr_conn` and `aggr_info` pointers are freed using `kfree`, but the function does not set these pointers to `NULL`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory management issue (Potential double-free).  
Bug Reason: If the pointers `aggr_info->aggr_conn` or `aggr_info` are accessed after they are freed in `kfree`, this leads to undefined behavior, potentially causing a crash or a security flaw. This could occur if another part of the code mistakenly assumes these pointers are still valid.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: After freeing the pointers using `kfree`, set them to `NULL` to avoid accidental dereference or double-free issues. Example:
```c
kfree(aggr_info->aggr_conn);
aggr_info->aggr_conn = NULL;
kfree(aggr_info);
aggr_info = NULL;
```
