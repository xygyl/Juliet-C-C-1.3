UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences `info` without checking for its nullity via `info->gate_bit`. If `info` is `NULL`, this would result in undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: There is no check ensuring that `info` is not `NULL` before accessing `info->gate_bit`. If `info` is `NULL`, it leads to a null pointer dereference, causing potential crashes.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to verify that `info` is not null:
```c
if (!info)
    return false; // or handle the error appropriately
```
