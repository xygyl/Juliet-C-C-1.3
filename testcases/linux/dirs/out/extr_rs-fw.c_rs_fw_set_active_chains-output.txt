### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function uses bitwise operations and conditional checks without any undefined behavior scenarios. The `WARN()` macro does not directly cause UB as it’s a typical logging/reporting mechanism, and the logic does not involve any operations that are undefined in standard C. There is no dereferencing of invalid pointers, accessing uninitialized variables, or signed integer overflows.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The `WARN()` macro explicitly states that antenna C is not supported, yet there’s no further handling for chains containing `ANT_C`. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the hardware relies on the `fw_chains` value, which ignores `ANT_C` entirely. The function effectively assumes that ignoring `ANT_C` is acceptable, which may not align with expectations.

Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: Medium  

### Fix Suggestion:
If antenna C is truly unsupported, the function should explicitly handle this case by either:
1. Rejecting configurations with `ANT_C` by returning an error code or zero.
2. Adding a comment or documentation explaining why `ANT_C` is ignored and confirming that upper layers properly manage such configurations.
3. Alternatively, remove configurations containing `ANT_C` (i.e., `chains &= ~ANT_C;`) before proceeding with the bitwise operations.
