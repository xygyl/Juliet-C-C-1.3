### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function potentially dereferences the `resource->occ_get_priv` in the call to `resource->occ_get(resource->occ_get_priv)` without checking if `resource` itself is a non-NULL pointer. Dereferencing a NULL pointer leads to undefined behavior. Additionally, the pointer to the function `resource->occ_get` is checked for NULL, but not validated for validity or correct function signature. Calling a corrupted or invalid function pointer also results in undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: If `resource` is NULL when this function is called, the access to `resource->occ_get` or `resource->occ_get_priv` will cause a null pointer dereference. There is no guarantee provided by this function that `resource` is a valid and non-NULL pointer. This could lead to a crash at runtime.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes   

### Confidence
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
1. Validate that the `resource` pointer is non-NULL before accessing its members:
   ```c
   if (!resource || !resource->occ_get)
       return 0;
   ```
2. Ensure proper validation of `resource->occ_get_priv` if any expected constraints exist for its value or use.
