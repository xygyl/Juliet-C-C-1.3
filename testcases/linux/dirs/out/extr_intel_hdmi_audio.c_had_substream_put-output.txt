Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel_hdmi_audio.c_had_substream_put.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The expression `intelhaddata->stream_info.substream_refcount--` may cause undefined behavior if `substream_refcount` is an unsigned type and its value is 0. Decrementing an unsigned value below zero results in wrapping behavior which is implementation-defined in C but can result in unintended outcomes.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer underflow
Bug Reason: If `substream_refcount` is unsigned and its value is 0, the decrement operation will cause an integer underflow and likely result in an excessively large positive value, which can destabilize logic depending on `substream_refcount`.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check before decrementing `substream_refcount` to ensure it is greater than 0, e.g.,
```
if (intelhaddata->stream_info.substream_refcount > 0)
    intelhaddata->stream_info.substream_refcount--;
```
This prevents both undefined behavior and the bug caused by integer underflow.
