Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cpufreq_ondemand.c_generic_powersave_bias_target.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code accesses frequency table members (`freq_table[index].frequency`) without ensuring that `index` is within bounds of the frequency table. If the `index` calculated by `cpufreq_frequency_table_target`, `cpufreq_table_find_index_h`, or `cpufreq_table_find_index_l` exceeds the bounds of the table, this causes undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds memory access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bound memory access
Bug Reason: Same reasoning as UBâ€”index calculations are not validated, potentially causing accesses beyond the bounds of the `freq_table` array.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds-checking code to ensure that `index` used for accessing `freq_table` is within valid range (e.g., between `0` and the size of the table). Return an error or handle cases where indices are out of range appropriately.
