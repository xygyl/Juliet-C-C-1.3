### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: 
- The function does not contain undefined behavior under the assumptions of proper inputs and valid memory accesses.  
- It performs checks for null pointers, mismatched types, and proper usage of structures such as `expr` and `symbol`.  
- There is no dereferencing of invalid or null pointers, no signed integer overflow, nor any violation of strict aliasing rules observed.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: 
- There are multiple code paths that do not handle unexpected `sym1` or `sym2` values adequately, resulting in potential NULL dereferences or mishandling logical cases.  
- For instance, in the conditional blocks of scenarios like `(e1->type == E_SYMBOL && e2->type == E_EQUAL)`, there is no fallback or verification for `sym1` against valid symbolic flags in certain flows.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Add more fallback handling and include checks for the validity of `sym1` and `sym2`.  
2. Refactor flows for scenarios when neither conditional expressions fall into expected logic (`NULL` should be avoided).  
3. Expand logging/debugging conditional code (`DEBUG_EXPR`) for verbose warnings during development when unexpected inputs occur.
