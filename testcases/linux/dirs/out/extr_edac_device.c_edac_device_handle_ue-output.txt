**UB Analysis**:  
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: This function does not exhibit any signs of undefined behavior. All pointer accesses and calculations are safeguarded by conditions that validate array bounds (`inst_nr` and `block_nr`). Null pointer dereferences are avoided because the `block` pointer is only set after bounds validation. No invalid memory access, signed integer overflow, uninitialized variable usage, or strict aliasing violations are evident.

**Bug Analysis**:  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: A potential logic flaw exists in the usage of `block`. In the case where an instance has zero blocks (`instance->nr_blocks == 0`), `block` remains `NULL`. This is handled correctly when printing messages (e.g., `block ? block->name : "N/A"`), but the increment of `block->counters.ue_count` (in `block->counters.ue_count++`) would trigger a null pointer dereference if this code path were entered for an instance with zero blocks. Although the bounds checks should prevent this, improper control flow could introduce this bug.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add an explicit check for `instance->nr_blocks > 0` before attempting to increment `block->counters.ue_count`. Specifically:

```c
if (instance->nr_blocks > 0) {
    block = instance->blocks + block_nr;
    if (block) {
        block->counters.ue_count++;
    }
}
```
This ensures that `block` is not dereferenced when `instance->nr_blocks == 0`.
