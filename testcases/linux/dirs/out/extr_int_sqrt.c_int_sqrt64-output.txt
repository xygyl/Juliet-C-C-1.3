Filename: `/home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_int_sqrt.c_int_sqrt64.c`
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function contains potential undefined behavior when it computes `1ULL << ((fls64(x) - 1) & ~1ULL)`. If `fls64(x)` is less than or equal to 0, `fls64(x) - 1` becomes negative. Bit-shifting negative values is undefined in the C language, as the result is implementation-dependent.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic error
Bug Reason: The logic assumes `fls64(x)` always returns a positive value, but it does not account for the cases where `x == 0`. In the case of `x == 0`, the bit shift may produce an incorrect result or undefined behavior due to a negative shift amount.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a guard at the beginning of the function to explicitly handle the case where `x == 0` and ensure all inputs are valid for the `fls64()` operation. For instance:

```c
if (x == 0)
    return 0;
```

This prevents undefined behavior and ensures correctness. Additionally, carefully check the input assumptions for `fls64()` to avoid potential negative shifts.
