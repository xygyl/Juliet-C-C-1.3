### **UB Analysis**:
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason:
1. **Buffer Overflow Risk**: The function modifies `bufPtr` and `bufSize` after every call to `scnprintf`. There is no explicit guarantee that `bufSize` will remain sufficient for subsequent writes. If `bufSize` becomes zero or negative, the next call to `scnprintf` could write beyond the allocated buffer, causing undefined behavior.
2. **Pointer Arithmetic on Potentially Invalid Pointers**: The function increments `bufPtr` even when `bufSize` might already be zero, leading to potential pointer arithmetic on invalid memory.

### **Bug Analysis**:
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason:
- The function does not check if `bufSize` is zero before making further calls to `scnprintf`. This can cause writes beyond the bounds of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

### **Confidence**:
Confidence: High
- The logic issue and buffer size decrementing behavior directly result in the possibility of UB and bugs.

### **Fix Suggestion**:
- Add validation to ensure `bufSize` is non-zero before calling `scnprintf`. For example:
  ```c
  if (bufSize > 0) {
      c2 = scnprintf(bufPtr, bufSize, ...);
      ...
  }
  else {
      break;
  }
  ```
- Introduce bounds checking before modifying `bufPtr` with pointer arithmetic and handling cases where the buffer allocation might be exhausted.
