UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior due to integer overflow in the arithmetic computation `(offs / SYSCON_REG_BITS) * SYSCON_REG_SIZE`. If `offs` or `SYSCON_REG_BITS` is zero, the division and/or subsequent multiplication could produce unexpected results. Similarly, if `offs` is excessively large, it could cause wrapping around or undefined behavior, although this depends on the validity of the input `offset` parameter.
