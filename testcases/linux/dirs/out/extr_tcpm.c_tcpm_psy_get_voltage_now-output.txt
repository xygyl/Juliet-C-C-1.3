UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `port` pointer is passed to the function but is not checked for nullity before being dereferenced. If `port == NULL` when the function is called, dereferencing it (`port->supply_voltage`) will lead to undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If the `port` pointer is null, dereferencing `port->supply_voltage` results in undefined behavior and a potential crash. This issue could occur depending on where this function is called and the validity of inputs.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a null-check for the `port` parameter at the beginning of the function to prevent null pointer dereference. Example:
```c
if (port == NULL)
    return -EINVAL;  // Return an appropriate error code if port is null
```
