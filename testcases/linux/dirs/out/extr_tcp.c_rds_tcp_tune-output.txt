Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_tcp.c_rds_tcp_tune.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential assignment of `rtn->rcvbuf_size` to `sk->sk_sndbuf` may result in undefined behavior due to type misinterpretation and mistaken reuse of the variable `sk->sk_sndbuf` for both send and receive buffer sizes. This appears unintended and violates logical expectations for buffer management.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The value of `rtn->rcvbuf_size` is mistakenly assigned to `sk->sk_sndbuf`, which is meant to represent the size of the send buffer. This overwriting logic may lead to incorrect configuration of the buffer sizes, resulting in undesired behavior and performance issues in socket operations.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Replace the second `sk->sk_sndbuf` assignment with `sk->sk_rcvbuf` or the appropriate variable representing the receive buffer size in the `sock` structure, assuming such a field is defined. Verify the structure for correct buffer fields before use.
