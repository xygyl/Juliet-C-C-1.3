Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_ecdh_helper.c_compute_ecdh_secret.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior exists in the `swap_digits` function due to its reliance on type punning with `u64`. The function casts `u8*` to `u64*` for byte-swapping, which can create alignment issues on architectures where `u64` requires strict memory alignment. Accessing misaligned addresses is undefined behavior in the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The function does not handle cases where `crypto_kpp_compute_shared_secret` fails (returns an error value). Although the error is printed via `pr_err`, the `secret` buffer might remain uninitialized or in an invalid state, leading to potential security risks when used later. Additionally, swapping the `secret` buffer twice after computation may lead to unintended data corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Replace type-punning based operations with portable alternatives, such as explicit per-byte swaps to handle potential misaligned data access.
2. Ensure the `secret` buffer is cleared or handled properly in case `crypto_kpp_compute_shared_secret` fails.
3. Confirm intended behavior of double swapping (it might indicate unintended logic).

Example fix for `swap_digits`:
```c
void swap_digits(u8 *src, u8 *dst, int count) {
    for (int i = 0; i < count * sizeof(u64); i += sizeof(u64)) {
        // Manually swap bytes to avoid alignment issues
        dst[i]     = src[i + 7];
        dst[i + 1] = src[i + 6];
        dst[i + 2] = src[i + 5];
        dst[i + 3] = src[i + 4];
        dst[i + 4] = src[i + 3];
        dst[i + 5] = src[i + 2];
        dst[i + 6] = src[i + 1];
        dst[i + 7] = src[i];
    }
}
```
