Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hns_roce_hw_v2.c_hns_roce_function_clear.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `msleep()` function is invoked with a signed scalar value (`HNS_ROCE_V2_READ_FUNC_CLEAR_FLAG_FAIL_WAIT`). If this value is negative (which cannot be confirmed from the code provided), the behavior of `msleep()` would be undefined. Additionally, the subtraction operation in `end -= HNS_ROCE_V2_READ_FUNC_CLEAR_FLAG_FAIL_WAIT` could lead to a signed integer underflow if `end` is smaller than `HNS_ROCE_V2_READ_FUNC_CLEAR_FLAG_FAIL_WAIT`, which is another undefined behavior per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw and possible infinite loop
Bug Reason: If none of the conditions in the `while` loop is met (e.g., `hns_roce_func_clr_chk_rst(hr_dev)` and `roce_get_bit(resp->func_done, FUNC_CLEAR_RST_FUN_DONE_S)` never evaluate to non-zero values), the loop would decrement `end` indefinitely due to signed integer underflow, resulting in an effectively infinite loop. This can lead to system unresponsiveness and resource exhaustion.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
1. **For UB**: Ensure that all scalar values used in `msleep()` calls are guaranteed to be positive. Validate the value of `HNS_ROCE_V2_READ_FUNC_CLEAR_FLAG_FAIL_WAIT` against negative inputs.
2. **For loop**: Add a validation before decrementing `end` to ensure it correctly handles boundary conditions and does not underflow. For example:
   ```c
   if (end < HNS_ROCE_V2_READ_FUNC_CLEAR_FLAG_FAIL_WAIT) {
       dev_err(hr_dev->dev, "Func clear timeout.\n");
       break;
   }
   end -= HNS_ROCE_V2_READ_FUNC_CLEAR_FLAG_FAIL_WAIT;
   ```
