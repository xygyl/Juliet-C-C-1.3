UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: This function performs arithmetic operations on unsigned 16-bit integers (`u16`) and does not validate the inputs or handle the case where `tx_last == tx_next`. In such a case, the subtraction might lead to an invalid calculation resulting in wrapping behavior. This is not undefined behavior strictly, but it clashes with logical expectations and could lead to issues in specific contexts.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
