### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: This function potentially accesses `tx_skb->len` without ensuring that `tx_skb` is initialized properly. If `tx_skb` is NULL, dereferencing it (`tx_skb->len`) will lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, there is no explicit validation of `ch` before testing `ch->bch.Flags`, which could lead to invalid memory access if `sel_bch_isar(isar, 1)` or `sel_bch_isar(isar, 2)` return NULL.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `ch->bch.tx_skb` is non-NULL before accessing its `len` member, which can lead to a null pointer dereference if `tx_skb` is actually NULL.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High    

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Add a check to ensure `ch` is non-NULL before using its members:
   ```c
   if (ch && test_bit(FLG_ACTIVE, &ch->bch.Flags)) {
   ```

2. Also ensure `ch->bch.tx_skb` is non-NULL before accessing `tx_skb->len`:
   ```c
   if (ch->bch.tx_skb && ch->bch.tx_skb->len > ch->bch.tx_idx) {
   ```

This will prevent both undefined behavior and a potential null pointer dereference.
