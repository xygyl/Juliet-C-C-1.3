UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit undefined behavior. Its logic is contained within a well-defined `switch` statement operating on an enumerated type without any memory access or operations that could lead to undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The input parameter `chan` is unused within the function and does not contribute to any logic or decision-making. This unused parameter might indicate either a missing or misplaced conditional use of `chan`, or it might reflect an oversight in parameter design. Functions should not have parameters without usage since they may confuse developers and suggest incomplete implementation.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: If `chan` is intended to influence the behavior of the function, ensure relevant logic is implemented. If it is redundant, remove the unused parameter to simplify the function signature.
