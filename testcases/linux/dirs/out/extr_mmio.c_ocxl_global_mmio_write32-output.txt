### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function performs pointer arithmetic on `afu->global_mmio_ptr` without verifying that `global_mmio_ptr` is non-NULL. Pointer arithmetic involving a NULL pointer leads to undefined behavior. Additionally, violating strict aliasing rules could occur if `afu->global_mmio_ptr` points to memory not properly aligned for the `u32` data type, and the alignment is not verified before calling `writel` or `writel_be`.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `afu->global_mmio_ptr` is NULL and the function attempts to write to the calculated memory address `(char *)afu->global_mmio_ptr + offset`, it would lead to a null pointer dereference, causing a runtime error.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Add a check to confirm that `afu->global_mmio_ptr` is not NULL at the beginning of the function:
   ```c
   if (afu->global_mmio_ptr == NULL)
       return -EINVAL;
   ```

2. Ensure proper alignment of `afu->global_mmio_ptr` for the `writel` and `writel_be` functions if portability and strict aliasing rules might be a concern.

This will eliminate potential undefined behavior and prevent null pointer dereferences. Further defensive programming could validate `offset` more rigorously based on `afu->config.global_mmio_size`.
