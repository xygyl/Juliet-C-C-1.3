Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fotg210-udc.c_fotg210_ep_release.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: In the call to `fotg210_reset_tseq`, the argument `ep->epnum` is set to `0` immediately before the call. The function `fotg210_reset_tseq` might expect a valid endpoint number. If it dereferences or operates on this endpoint, undefined behavior could occur as the value doesnâ€™t represent a valid endpoint number.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function overwrites `ep->epnum` to `0` before passing it to `fotg210_reset_tseq`. Therefore, `fotg210_reset_tseq` might not behave correctly or as expected because `epnum=0` does not represent a valid endpoint after being reset. This could lead to unexpected program behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Possibly (depending on what `fotg210_reset_tseq` does with `epnum`).  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: The `fotg210_reset_tseq` function should be called before setting `ep->epnum` to `0`. Alternatively, clarify whether `fotg210_reset_tseq` supports an endpoint number of `0` and adjust the logic accordingly.
