### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function directly references a pointer (`udev->product`) and may dereference it without ensuring it is non-null in all call paths. Specifically, the code does not check the validity of the `udev` pointer globally before accessing its fields (`udev->product`, `udev->serial`, etc.). Moreover, `usb_string()` is called with `function` as an input, which could be an unusable index for USB descriptor fetching, potentially causing undefined behavior. Moreover, there is no widespread global memory safety from null invalidation, even.
