UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function may cause undefined behavior by dereferencing the `cookie` pointer without checking if it is `NULL`. If `cookie` happens to be `NULL`, calling `memcpy(foc->val, cookie, len)` results in invalid memory access, which is undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: No validation is done to ensure `cookie` is non-NULL before dereferencing it in `memcpy`. Although `len` is checked for validity, `cookie` remains unchecked, leading to a potential null pointer dereference.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `cookie` is not `NULL` before performing any operations with it (e.g., `if (cookie == NULL) return;`).
