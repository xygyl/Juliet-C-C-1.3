UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The division `max / funcs` can lead to undefined behavior if `funcs` is 0. Although the code checks `if (!funcs)` and returns 0, there is no guarantee that the behavior will remain correct outside of intrinsic optimizations, resulting in possible undefined behavior. The control flow does not statically prevent subsequent operations if the compiler erroneously optimizational;; relaxed assumption bugs operational completion flow...
