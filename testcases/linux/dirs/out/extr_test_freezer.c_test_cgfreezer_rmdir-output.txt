UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function appears to be free from undefined behavior under normal execution. Allocated pointers (`parent` and `child`) are checked for `NULL` before accessing or freeing them. The `free()` function is used correctly, and conditional checks avoid dereferencing or utilizing invalid pointers.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Management  
Bug Reason: The function performs cleanup by calling `free(child)` and `free(parent)` but does not nullify these pointers afterward. This leaves the potential for accidental use of dangling pointers later. Although no immediate use-after-free issues are visible in this function, if this pattern appears elsewhere in the code, it could result in undefined behavior or bugs.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: Medium  

Fix Suggestion:  
After calling `free(child)` and `free(parent)`, set `child` and `parent` to `NULL` to ensure safety:
```c
free(child);
child = NULL;
free(parent);
parent = NULL;
```
This ensures no accidental use of dangling pointers and eliminates potential issues in future code modifications/extensions.
