Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sti_hdmi.c_hdmi_avi_infoframe_config.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: `hdmi_avi_infoframe_pack` returning a negative value is directly passed as the size argument to `hdmi_infoframe_write_infopack`. If used incorrectly later, such as in memory operations, this could lead to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the `ret` parameter after calling `hdmi_avi_infoframe_pack` and directly uses it as the size for `hdmi_infoframe_write_infopack`. If `ret` is negative, it can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a validation check for `ret` after calling `hdmi_avi_infoframe_pack`. For example:
```c
if (ret < 0) {
    DRM_ERROR("Invalid AVI infoframe size: %d\n", ret);
    return ret;
}
```
This ensures no negative value propagates further into `hdmi_infoframe_write_infopack`.
