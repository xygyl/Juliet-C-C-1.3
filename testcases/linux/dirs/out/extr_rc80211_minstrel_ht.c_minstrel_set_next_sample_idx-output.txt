UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function potentially performs out‐of‐bounds array access because the `mi->sample_group` index is incremented and modulated by `ARRAY_SIZE(minstrel_mcs_groups)` but directly used to index the `mi->groups` and `mi->supported` arrays without validation whether their sizes match `ARRAY_SIZE(minstrel_mcs_groups)`. This could lead to undefined behavior if accessed indices exceed the array bounds.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: The same issue as mentioned in the UB analysis: unvalidated use of `mi->sample_group` as an index into `mi->groups` and `mi->supported`. If these arrays have fewer elements than `ARRAY_SIZE(minstrel_mcs_groups)`, there could be out-of-bounds access leading to incorrect execution or memory corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Introduce bounds checking to ensure `mi->groups` and `mi->supported` arrays are consistent with `ARRAY_SIZE(minstrel_mcs_groups)`. For instance, add a check like below before accessing `mi->supported` or `mi->groups`:  

```c
if (mi->sample_group >= size_of_groups_array || mi->sample_group >= size_of_supported_array) {
    // Handle error, log, or return.
}
```  

Alternatively, the design should ensure that `ARRAY_SIZE(minstrel_mcs_groups)` correctly reflects the sizes of these arrays.
