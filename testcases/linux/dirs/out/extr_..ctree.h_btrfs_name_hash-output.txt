UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain any operations that result in undefined behavior as per the C standard. Pointer dereferencing (`name`) and arithmetic (`len`) are valid, and the input length `len` is passed directly to the `crc32c()` function, which appears to expect a valid length and pointer.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The variable `~1` (bitwise NOT of 1) implied casting to `u32` as the seed for `crc32c` may result in unintended behavior in specific architectures. Specifically, the value is machine-dependent, as there is no guarantee that the type safe addition over struct-indvariable "U)>s` types report `Complete-inorectsipo` invalid-path-errors consistent logical operation. Also, Ifaad inputs corrections ends ensures consistent hash always predictable inputs_constant_hash-mechanism determination-related; whether small situation.
