Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_iio_event_monitor.c_print_event.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is a risk of undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds access in arrays like `iio_chan_type_name_spec`, `iio_modifier_names`, `iio_ev_type_text`, and `iio_ev_dir_text`, since the function assumes the extracted enum values (`type`, `mod`, `ev_type`, `dir`) are valid indices without bounds checks. Without verification, these indices may exceed the bounds of the arrays, resulting in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: An invalid `event->id` value could lead to incorrect results, where the function may access memory it does not own or may print incorrect event details due to unverified inputs. There is also missing handling for negative or otherwise invalid values of `chan` and `chan2`, potentially causing inconsistent output or incorrect results.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add bounds checks for all extracted values (`type`, `mod`, `ev_type`, `dir`) before using them as array indices. For example:
   ```c
   if (type < 0 || type >= ARRAY_SIZE(iio_chan_type_name_spec)) {
       fprintf(stderr, "Invalid channel type index: %d\n", type);
       return;
   }
   ```
2. Similarly, validate `chan` and `chan2` to ensure they are within expected ranges.
3. Implement complete error handling for invalid `event->id` values to ensure the program reliably detects unknown events.
