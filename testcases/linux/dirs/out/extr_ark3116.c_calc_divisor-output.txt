Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_ark3116.c_calc_divisor.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow may occur during the arithmetic operation `12000000 + 2*bps` if `bps` is sufficiently large and positive, as it could exceed the range of the signed `int` type.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: The unsigned integer overflow can lead to incorrect divisor calculations, potentially causing erroneous behavior in dependent logic.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `bps` is within a reasonable range by validating it before the calculation. Alternatively, use a wider data type (e.g., `unsigned long long`) to prevent overflow:
```c
static inline int calc_divisor(int bps)
{
    if (bps <= 0) {
        return -1; // Invalid bps input, handle as an error
    }
    unsigned long long numerator = 12000000ULL + 2 * (unsigned long long)bps;
    return (int)(numerator / (4 * (unsigned long long)bps));
}
```
