UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function relies on a global variable `left`, which is undefined in the provided code snippet. Using an undeclared global variable causes undefined behavior since its type, size, and value are unknown, potentially leading to unexpected operation or segmentation faults during execution.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function assumes `buf` is pre-allocated and writable, but it doesn't validate its length or ensure safety of the buffer operations such as `scnprintf`. Without validating the buffer size against `left`, it may result in a buffer overflow if the value of `left` is incorrect (too large). Furthermore, it can be inferred that `buf` is neither initialized nor guaranteed to be writable in all cases.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
- Ensure `left` is properly declared, initialized, and passed to the function as a parameter rather than relying on a global variable.  
- Add a check to validate if `buf` has sufficient space for the operation based on `left`. If `left` is undefined and its intended maximum size cannot be assumed, explicitly verify or limit its range at runtime. For example:  
  ```c
  if (left <= 0 || left > MAX_BUF_SIZE) {
      return -EINVAL;
  }
  ```
- Consider making `left` a function argument and adding proper comments for its intended use.
