Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_util.c_vm_commit_limit.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The expression `sysctl_overcommit_kbytes >> (PAGE_SHIFT - 10)` can cause undefined behavior if `PAGE_SHIFT` is less than 10 (negative right shift), as right shifting by a negative value is undefined in C. Additionally, signed integer overflow may occur in arithmetic `(totalram_pages() - hugetlb_total_pages()) * sysctl_overcommit_ratio`. C standard specifies signed integer overflow as undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow and Arithmetic Error  
Bug Reason: If `sysctl_overcommit_ratio` is large enough, the multiplication `(totalram_pages() - hugetlb_total_pages()) * sysctl_overcommit_ratio` might overflow an integer type, causing incorrect arithmetic and potentially leading to system misconfiguration. Also, the negative shift if `PAGE_SHIFT - 10` is negative may cause incorrect behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:
- Guard against negative or excessively high `PAGE_SHIFT` values before performing the right shift (`if (PAGE_SHIFT > 10)`).
- Use a larger data type (e.g., `unsigned long long`) to safely handle arithmetic in cases where overflow risk exists (`unsigned long allowed` may need updating if intermediate calculations exceed limits of `unsigned long`).

Example Code Patch:
```c
unsigned long vm_commit_limit(void)
{
    unsigned long allowed;

    if (sysctl_overcommit_kbytes) {
        if (PAGE_SHIFT < 10) {  // Check and prevent negative shift.
            return 0; // Error handling: Limit cannot be computed correctly.
        }
        allowed = (unsigned long)(sysctl_overcommit_kbytes >> (PAGE_SHIFT - 10));
    } else {
        unsigned long temp = totalram_pages() - hugetlb_total_pages();
        if (temp > (ULONG_MAX / sysctl_overcommit_ratio * 100)) {
            return ULONG_MAX; // Handle overflow by capping.
        }
        allowed = (unsigned long)(temp * sysctl_overcommit_ratio / 100);
    }
    allowed += total_swap_pages;

    return allowed;
}
```
