UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Out-of-bounds array access is possible. If `num_nibbles` is sufficiently large such that `number_of_bits` exceeds the total bits available in the `data` array (`size_t num_nibbles` specifies nibbles, not bytes), the `array_index` could increment beyond the valid range of `data`, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This causes undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory issue (Out-of-bounds read)  
Bug Reason: There is no validation to ensure that `num_nibbles` corresponds to valid data in the `uint8_t *data` array. As `array_index` is incremented based on `number_of_bits`, it can exceed the bounds of the input `data`, leading to a memory-access violation.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add validation logic to ensure `num_nibbles` does not exceed the amount of actual data provided in `data`. For example:  
```c  
if (num_nibbles > (data_size * 2)) { // Assuming data_size is the length of the data array  
    // Handle error: num_nibbles exceeds available input data  
}
```  
Alternatively, ensure `data` is always sufficiently long to match `num_nibbles`. This places responsibility on callers or ensures input integrity.
