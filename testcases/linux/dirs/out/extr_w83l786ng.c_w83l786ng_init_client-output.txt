UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The variable `reset` is used without being defined or initialized in the function. This leads to undefined behavior as the value of `reset` can be arbitrary, potentially causing unintended logic execution.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The use of the uninitialized variable `reset` introduces a logic issue where the behavior of the `if (reset)` condition is unpredictable. Depending on the state of memory, the condition may erroneously evaluate to true or false.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Properly define and initialize the variable `reset` before its usage in the function. Alternatively, ensure its value is explicitly set by external context that is verified to exist and initialized before the function is called.
