UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `NETDEV_TX_BUSY` return path does not release the `skb` buffer or reset the `priv->tx_skb` reference, potentially causing memory mismanagement ranging from double frees to use-after-free in subsequent execution.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory leak  
Bug Reason: If the `NETDEV_TX_BUSY` case is triggered, the allocated `skb` is left unreleased, resulting in a memory leak. Furthermore, `priv->tx_skb` does not reset or handle the state gracefully, leading to potential garbage references.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure proper cleanup of the `skb` in the `NETDEV_TX_BUSY` case before returning. This might involve freeing or re-queuing the `skb` buffer to prevent memory-related bugs. Resetting `priv->tx_skb` is also recommended in this error path.  

Corrected snippet:  
```c
	if ((cc770_read_reg(priv, msgobj[mo].ctrl1) & TXRQST_UNC) == TXRQST_SET) {
		netdev_err(dev, "TX register is still occupied!\n");
		dev_kfree_skb(skb); // Properly free skb to prevent memory leak
		priv->tx_skb = NULL; // Reset tx_skb
		return NETDEV_TX_BUSY;
	}
```
