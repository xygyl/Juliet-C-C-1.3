UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The field `info->par` is accessed directly without verifying whether `info` or `info->par` is `NULL`. Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer results in undefined behavior as per the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If the pointer `info` or `info->par` is `NULL`, the dereference leads to a null pointer dereference, causing access violations and potential crashes at runtime.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `info` is not `NULL` and `info->par` is not `NULL` before dereferencing `info->par`. Example:  

```c
if (!info || !info->par) {
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
