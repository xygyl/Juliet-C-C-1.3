UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The line `*pipe = (val & LVDS_PIPE_SEL_MASK_CPT) >> LVDS_PIPE_SEL_SHIFT_CPT;` may result in undefined behavior if `LVDS_PIPE_SEL_SHIFT_CPT` exceeds the width of the `pipe` enum type. Bit shifting a value by an amount greater than or equal to the width of the integer type causes undefined behavior per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The logic erroneously assumes that the `pipe` input parameter will always have sufficient width to accommodate the bit-shifting operation. If `enum pipe` has an underlying type smaller than the width of `LVDS_PIPE_SEL_SHIFT_CPT`, it may corrupt the value of `pipe` or exhibit unintended behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `LVDS_PIPE_SEL_SHIFT_CPT` and `LVDS_PIPE_SEL_SHIFT` values are validated against the underlying width of the `pipe` enum before performing the shift operation. Alternatively, cast the result of the bit shift to a suitable integer type (e.g., `unsigned int`) before assigning to `*pipe`.

Example fix:
```c
if (HAS_PCH_CPT(dev_priv))
    *pipe = (enum pipe)((val & LVDS_PIPE_SEL_MASK_CPT) >> LVDS_PIPE_SEL_SHIFT_CPT);
else
    *pipe = (enum pipe)((val & LVDS_PIPE_SEL_MASK) >> LVDS_PIPE_SEL_SHIFT);
```
