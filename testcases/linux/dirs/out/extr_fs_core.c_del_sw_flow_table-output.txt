### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function contains potential undefined behavior due to improper use of the `fs_get_obj()` macro-like function. If the `node` or `ft->node.parent` pointers are NULL, dereferencing them will result in undefined behavior. Additionally, the behavior of the `fs_get_obj()` implementation itself is uncertain since its actual code is not provided or visible. This lack of visibility makes proper analysis of any type-punning violations or strict aliasing violations within `fs_get_obj()` impossible.  
There is also a potential issue if `prio->num_ft` is decremented below zero, which may result in an incorrect state or usage based on context.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not verify whether `node` or `ft->node.parent` is NULL before dereferencing them via `fs_get_obj()` and accessing `prio->num_ft`. If those pointers are NULL, the program would attempt to access invalid memory, triggering a null pointer dereference bug. This likely leads to an unrecoverable crash.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add null-pointer checks for `node` and `ft->node.parent` before dereferencing them.  
   ```c
   if (!node)
       return; // Or handle error appropriately.

   fs_get_obj(ft, node);

   if (!ft || !ft->node.parent)
       return; // Or handle error appropriately.
   ```

2. Ensure that `prio->num_ft` decrement logic is guarded so that underflow cannot occur.

3. Review the implementation of `fs_get_obj()` for further errors or violations of strict aliasing rules.
