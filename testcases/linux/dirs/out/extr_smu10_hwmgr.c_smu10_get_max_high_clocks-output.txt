UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not perform any operations that would lead to undefined behavior according to the C standard. Both parameters are pointers, but they are not dereferenced in ways that could result in UB (e.g., NULL dereference). The hard-coded integer assignment is well-defined.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function hard-codes the value of `engine_max_clock` to `80000`. This is commented as temporary, but there is no mechanism to query the actual clock value or verify its correctness. If this hard-coded value is incorrect or stale, it can lead to incorrect behavior in the context where this function is used. This logic flaw could potentially result in performance issues or incorrect assumptions about hardware capability.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Implement logic to dynamically fetch the actual maximum engine clock value from the hardware or firmware instead of relying on a hard-coded value. If this is not feasible, add more detailed comments or methods to verify that the hard-coded value remains correct for the target hardware.
