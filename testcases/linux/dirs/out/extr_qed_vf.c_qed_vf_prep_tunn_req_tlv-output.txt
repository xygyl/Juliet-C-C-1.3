UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential dereference of a null pointer in the lines where `p_port` or `p_req` are used without verifying they are non-null. If the caller passes a null pointer for `p_port` or `p_req`, this would result in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate its pointer arguments (`p_req`, `p_port`, etc.) against null before dereferencing them. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if the caller fails to ensure valid pointers are passed.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer checks for all incoming pointers before their usage. For example:
```c
if (!p_req || !p_port || !p_cls || !p_update_port || !p_udp_port) {
    return; // or handle the error appropriately
}
```
