Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_hw-me.c_mei_me_fw_status.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code does not verify whether `fw_src->count` is within bounds of `MEI_FW_STATUS_MAX`. If `fw_src->count` exceeds `MEI_FW_STATUS_MAX`, the for-loop can access out-of-bounds elements in the `fw_status->status` array, leading to undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds memory access.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw (Boundary check missing)  
Bug Reason: The lack of validation for `fw_src->count` being greater than or equal to `MEI_FW_STATUS_MAX` could allow memory corruption or access to uninitialized array elements, causing unpredictable behavior that propagates beyond this function.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add an explicit boundary check to ensure `fw_src->count <= MEI_FW_STATUS_MAX`. For example:  
```c
if (fw_src->count > MEI_FW_STATUS_MAX)  
    return -EINVAL;  
```
