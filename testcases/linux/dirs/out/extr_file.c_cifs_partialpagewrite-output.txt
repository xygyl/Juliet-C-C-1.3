Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_file.c_cifs_partialpagewrite.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The adjustment of the `write_data` pointer via `write_data += from;` can lead to pointer arithmetic that exceeds the valid range of the page's memory mapping if `from > PAGE_SIZE`. Although the code explicitly checks `if ((to > PAGE_SIZE) || (from > to))`, this check does not prevent `from > PAGE_SIZE` from being used earlier in `write_data += from;`.
  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The logic to prevent out-of-bounds issues due to `from` exceeding the valid mapping of the page is placed after the pointer arithmetic operation. This may result in accessing invalid memory locations. Additionally, there is a potential off-by-one error when calculating the range `to - from` and verifying if the file extension is handled correctly in cases where file size matches `offset`.
  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Check `from <= PAGE_SIZE` before performing pointer arithmetic (`write_data += from;`). Additionally, verify and handle edge cases in file size checks to ensure logic correctness regarding when and how the `to` value is adjusted. Example fix for the pointer adjustment:

```c
if (from > PAGE_SIZE) {
    kunmap(page);
    return -EIO;
}
write_data += from;
```
