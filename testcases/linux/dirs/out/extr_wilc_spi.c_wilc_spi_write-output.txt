### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not explicitly perform operations that violate the C standard. No uninitialized variables are accessed, no null-pointers are dereferenced, and no out-of-bounds memory accesses are evident within the scope of this function's logic.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function validates `size <= 4` early and returns `0` without providing proper error handling or feedback to the caller. However, this check only occurs for the first portion of the function logic. If `spi_cmd_complete` or `spi_data_write` fail, the error is logged (`dev_err`) but the function still returns `1`, suggesting success. This inconsistency can lead the caller to incorrectly assume the data was written successfully when it was not.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Clearly handle the case when `size <= 4` by returning a distinct error code or propagating the error.
   ```c
   if (size <= 4) {
       dev_err(&spi->dev, "Invalid size: must be greater than 4\n");
       return -EINVAL; // Return a meaningful error code (e.g., -EINVAL).
   }
   ```
2. Ensure error propagation after `spi_cmd_complete` and `spi_data_write` failures. For example:
   ```c
   result = spi_cmd_complete(wilc, CMD_DMA_EXT_WRITE, addr, NULL, size, 0);
   if (result != N_OK) {
       dev_err(&spi->dev, "Failed cmd, write block (%08x)...\n", addr);
       return result; // Return the failure code.
   }
   
   result = spi_data_write(wilc, buf, size);
   if (result != N_OK) {
       dev_err(&spi->dev, "Failed block data write...\n");
       return result; // Return the failure code.
   }
   return 1; // Indicate success only if both operations succeed.
   ```
