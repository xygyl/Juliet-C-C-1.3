Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_drbd_receiver.c_drbd_disconnected.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function invokes `resync_timer_fn()` directly on the `device->resync_timer` object after a call to `del_timer_sync()` on the same timer object. According to the Linux kernel timer API, using a timer object after it has been passed to `del_timer_sync()` can lead to undefined behavior since the object might no longer be valid for use.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The direct invocation of `resync_timer_fn()` on a timer object after it has been deactivated via `del_timer_sync()` violates expected usage patterns from the kernel's timer API. This may result in unintended side effects, such as interacting with invalid memory or causing race conditions.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Remove the direct invocation of `resync_timer_fn(&device->resync_timer)` after `del_timer_sync(&device->resync_timer)`. Ensure the timer object is reinitialized properly before being utilized again if needed.
