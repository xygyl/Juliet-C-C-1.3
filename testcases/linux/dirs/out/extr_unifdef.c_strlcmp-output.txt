### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not explicitly check if `s` or `t` are `NULL` before dereferencing them. If either pointer is `NULL`, dereferencing it will result in undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: If `s` or `t` is `NULL` and this function is called, dereferencing `*s` or `*t` will cause a runtime error. This occurs because the function assumes both pointers are valid without verifying.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
Add checks to validate that `s` and `t` are not `NULL` before dereferencing them. For example:
```c
if (s == NULL || t == NULL) {
    // handle error or return a meaningful value
    return -1;
}
```  
This ensures the function handles invalid input more gracefully and avoids undefined behavior.
