## UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic**:
   - The code does `*node.string++ = c;` to increment `node.string`, but doesn't verify if `node.string` is within bounds of the `buffer` when assigning values. The safety check `node.string >= buffer + sizeof(buffer) - 1` is performed too late, after writing to `node.string` can already overflow the `buffer`.
   - If `node.string` increments beyond `buffer + sizeof(buffer) - 1`, writing to it is undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds memory access.

2. **Non-portable memory alignment**:
   - `node.string += 2;` potentially shifts the pointer to a memory location misaligned with strict aliasing or buffer size constraints. This operation assumes memory alignment is valid without verifying.

## Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason:  
- The function does not properly prevent writing beyond `buffer` due to the late boundary check (`node.string >= buffer + sizeof(buffer) - 1`). If `node.string` overflows `buffer`, subsequent writes corrupt adjacent memory.
- The check to prevent a long token (`256 characters`) is performed after attempting a write, which can lead to buffer overflow and memory corruption.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Perform bounds checking before assigning `*node.string = c;`, ensuring that writes are made only within the valid boundaries of `buffer`.

   ```c
   if (node.string >= buffer + sizeof(buffer) - 1) {
       fprintf(stderr, "Token too long\n");
       exit(1);
   }
   *node.string++ = c;
   ```
2. Use a custom helper function to limit the buffer writes securely, or employ safer string handling methods.

3. Consider validating `node.string` alignment and avoid skipping characters with non-portable pointer adjustments like `+= 2`.
