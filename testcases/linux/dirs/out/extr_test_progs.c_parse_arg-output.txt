UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: * Pointer `subtest_str` can be dereferenced after being set to `\0`. This causes UB if the pointer points to the middle of the string `arg` since the resulting new string does not guarantee null-termination beyond where the pointer was decremented.
* Pointer `arg` is followed by a `subtest_str` incorrect manipulation that could cause buffer overrun causing inexplicit eligibility to stack corruption shoe implicit.
