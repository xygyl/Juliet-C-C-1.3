Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hda_generic.c_mux_select.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential dereference of a null pointer occurs if `get_input_path()` returns `NULL`, which happens twice in the function (`old_path` and `path`). Dereferences like `old_path->active` and `path->active` depend on valid non-null pointers but are not safeguarded against a `NULL` return value from `get_input_path()`.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: Dereferencing `old_path` or `path` without verifying their validity will lead to crashes if `get_input_path()` returns `NULL`. This indicates a straightforward null pointer dereference bug.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Insert null checks before dereferencing `old_path` and `path`. For example:
```c
if (!old_path || !path) {
    return 0;
}
```
