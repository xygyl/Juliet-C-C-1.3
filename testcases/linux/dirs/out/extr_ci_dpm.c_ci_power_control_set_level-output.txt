UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code performs a signed integer multiplication `-1 * rdev->pm.dpm.tdp_adjustment` without ensuring that `tdp_adjustment` cannot result in a signed integer overflow, which is undefined behavior in C. Additionally, integer division and multiplication involving `configurable_tdp` (cast to `s32`) are performed without bounds checking, which introduces the risk of overflow and undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason: Integer overflow could occur when calculating `target_tdp = ...` resulting from `(100 + adjust_percent) * (s32)cac_tdp_table->configurable_tdp`. This can lead to incorrect TDP adjustments, especially if `adjust_percent` or `configurable_tdp` have excessively large absolute values or improper user-provided input.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Validate `rdev->pm.dpm.tdp_adjustment` and `cac_tdp_table->configurable_tdp` to ensure their values are within safe bounds to avoid overflow in arithmetic operations.  
2. Perform the calculations using an appropriately wide type, such as `long long`, and verify the computed result fits within the range of `s32` before casting back.  
3. Add defensive code to handle excessive TDP adjustment percentages or invalid values. For example:
   ```c
   if (rdev->pm.dpm.tdp_adjustment > 100 || rdev->pm.dpm.tdp_adjustment < -100) {
       return -EINVAL; // Invalid adjustment percentage
   }
   if (cac_tdp_table->configurable_tdp > INT_MAX || cac_tdp_table->configurable_tdp < 0) {
       return -EINVAL; // Invalid TDP range
   }
   ```  
4. Consider using modular arithmetic or saturation techniques to handle overflow gracefully, especially for hardware-related computations like TDP adjustment.
