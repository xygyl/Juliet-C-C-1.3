Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_session.c_perf_event__mmap2_swap.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `strlen` function is being used on `data`, but `data` is a void pointer. This causes undefined behavior because `strlen` expects a `const char *` and cannot operate on `void *`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The incorrect use of `strlen(data)` likely causes incorrect alignment calculations for `data`. This might lead to memory corruption when `swap_sample_id_all` operates on `data`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Cast `data` to `const char *` before calling `strlen`, as follows: `PERF_ALIGN(strlen((const char *)data) + 1, sizeof(u64));`.
