Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_verifier.c_opt_remove_dead_code.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code accesses `aux_data[i + j]` without verifying whether `i + j` is within bounds. If `i + j` exceeds the array bounds of `aux_data`, this results in undefined behavior due to an out-of-bounds memory access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: The variable `j` is incremented in the inner `while` loop without verifying whether `i + j` is a valid index of the `aux_data` array. This can lead to accessing memory locations beyond the allocated range of the array, causing undefined behavior and potential program crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Include a condition inside the `while` loop to ensure `i + j` remains less than `insn_cnt` before accessing `aux_data[i + j]`. For example:

```c
while (i + j < insn_cnt && i + j >= 0 && !aux_data[i + j].seen)
```
Alternatively, add explicit bounds checking: 
```c
if (i + j >= insn_cnt)
    break;
```
This will prevent out-of-bounds access during the iteration.
