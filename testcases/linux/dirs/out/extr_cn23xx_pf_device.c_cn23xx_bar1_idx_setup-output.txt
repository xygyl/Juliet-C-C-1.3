UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code shifts a signed integer (`core_addr`, which is `u64`) by 22 bits and may introduce undefined behavior if shifting a bit beyond the width of the type. Signed left-shifts that cause integer overflow are undefined behavior in C. Additionally, there are potential concerns about aliasing due to the WRITE_ONCE and READ_ONCE semantics, which rely on volatile operations, complicating strict aliasing rules or memory consistency issues.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflows/Significance bugs  
Bug Reason: The shift arithmetic (`(core_addr intervals within the mask peripherals resulting INTERVAL shifts)` ,ancetype size_t <<= b/cull storage) accompanying visible `WRITE structure (vol/int-u-l-li-discretion ).hxx-flag(semantics>.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
