UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences the members `rate` and `format` of the `runtime` pointer without checking if the pointer is `NULL`. If `runtime` is passed as `NULL` during invocation, this will result in undefined behavior due to accessing invalid memory.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If the caller passes `NULL` for the `runtime` parameter, any access to `runtime->rate` and `runtime->format` will lead to a crash or undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to validate that `runtime` is not `NULL` before accessing its members. For example:
```
if (runtime == NULL) {
    return -EINVAL; /* Return an appropriate error code, e.g., invalid argument */
}
```
