Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mei_hdcp.c_mei_hdcp_verify_hprime.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function accesses the `h_prime` buffer in `send_hprime_in`, which is declared without initializing its contents. This may result in undefined behavior if the structure or associated buffer is accessed before proper initialization or assignment. Additionally, the `header.status` field of `send_hprime_in` is set to `ME_HDCP_STATUS_SUCCESS` before ensuring it was initialized appropriately, which can also lead to UB.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: There is no check for the size of the `send_hprime_in.h_prime` buffer before copying data into it using `memcpy()`. The size of `HDCP_2_2_H_PRIME_LEN` suggests it should fit, but this assumption is hardcoded and not validated. If ever mismatched, this would lead to buffer overflows, resulting in potential memory corruption.

Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
- Initialize all fields of `send_hprime_in` explicitly to ensure no UB arises due to uninitialized memory.
- Validate the size compatibility between `HDCP_2_2_H_PRIME_LEN` and the buffer size of `send_hprime_in.h_prime` before calling `memcpy()`.
- Use safer alternatives like `memcpy_s` for stricter bounds checking during memory copy operations.
