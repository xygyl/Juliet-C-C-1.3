Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sysfs.c_intr_coalesce_store.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `sscanf()` function is provided with a format string `%du`, which is non-standard. The correct format specifier for scanning an integer from a string is `%d` or `%i`. Using an invalid format specifier causes undefined behavior, as it doesn't conform to the standard library's expectations.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The condition `sscanf(page, "%du", &intr_coalesce) != -1` is incorrectly used. The correct behavior would be to check whether `sscanf()` returned exactly 1 (the number of successfully assigned items). A return value of -1 is invalid since `sscanf()` for successful matches returns the total number of assigned items, not -1.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Replace `%du` with `%d` in the `sscanf()` format string to comply with the standard:  
   ```c  
   if (sscanf(page, "%d", &intr_coalesce) == 1) {  
   ```  
2. Ensure `sscanf()` checks for return value `1` to confirm successful parsing.
