UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is potential for dereferencing a null pointer. The function assumes `pipe_ctx->plane_res.dpp` and `pipe_ctx->plane_res.hubp` are non-null without performing explicit null checks. If either of these pointers is `NULL`, the program exhibits undefined behavior since the member `inst` is accessed directly.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: Trying to dereference a possibly null pointer (`pipe_ctx->plane_res.dpp` or `pipe_ctx->plane_res.hubp`) in `dcn20_dpp_pg_control` and `dcn20_hubp_pg_control` function calls would lead to a runtime error and could crash the system. The null pointer dereference bug is caused by the lack of validation of struct member pointers before use.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add checks for null pointers before accessing their members. For example:  
```c
if (pipe_ctx->plane_res.dpp != NULL && pipe_ctx->plane_res.hubp != NULL) {
    dcn20_dpp_pg_control(hws, pipe_ctx->plane_res.dpp->inst, true);
    dcn20_hubp_pg_control(hws, pipe_ctx->plane_res.hubp->inst, true);
}
```  
Alternatively, consider adding assertions or logging to detect invalid inputs early during development or debug time.
