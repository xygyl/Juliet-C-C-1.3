### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The line `tmp = (30 + c->chan->center_freq - c->center_freq1)/20;` and similar lines in this function may cause undefined behavior if `c->chan` or `c->chan->center_freq` is a null pointer because the `c->chan` pointer is dereferenced without any prior validation or null-checks. If the provided `struct cfg80211_chan_def *c` contains a `NULL` `chan` member, dereferencing it will result in undefined behavior. Additionally, integer division operations like `/20` are safe here as long as the data underlying the variables does not cause unexpected values.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `c->chan` is NULL, dereferencing `c->chan->center_freq` will lead to a crash (undefined behavior). There is no check ensuring `c->chan` is non-NULL before it is dereferenced, making this function prone to runtime errors in cases where invalid or incomplete data is passed.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:  
Include a null-pointer check for `c->chan` before dereferencing it, such as:  
```c
if (!c->chan) {
    WARN_ON_ONCE(1);
    *pri40 = 0;
    *pri80 = 0;
    return;
}
```  
This ensures that the function gracefully handles the case where `c->chan` is NULL.
