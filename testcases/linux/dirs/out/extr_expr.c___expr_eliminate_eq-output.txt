### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: 
1. **Dereferencing potential null pointers (`e1` and `e2`)**: The function assumes that `e1` and `e2` are valid pointers without null checks. If either of them is null, dereferencing their members (`e1->type`, `e1->left.expr`, etc.) would result in undefined behavior.
2. **Use of uninitialized local variables (`e1` and `e2`)**: The variables `e1` and `e2` are local pointers but are not initialized prior to being passed to the function. Their values are undefined, which can lead to undefined behavior during dereference.
3. **Access to member `sym`**: If `e1->left` or `e2->left` were invalid pointers (due to uninitialized `e1` or `e2`), accessing `sym` leads to undefined behavior.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic/Memory-Related
Bug Reason: 
1. **Uninitialized variable usage**: The function uses `e1` and `e2` without initializing them or checking their values. This can cause unexpected behavior or crashes.
2. **Potential null pointer dereference**: The dereferencing of `e1` and `e2` assumes they are valid pointers, but if either is passed as null, the program may crash or behave erratically.
3. **Memory management issue**: The calls to `expr_free(e1)` and `expr_free(e2)` attempt to free the memory pointed to by `e1` and `e2`. If either of these is uninitialized or not dynamically allocated, this would lead to undefined behavior (double-free, invalid-free, etc.).
4. **Logic flaw**: The function blindly assumes that it can compare `e1` and `e2` as leaf nodes without verifying their validity or actual context. Invalid comparisons or recursions could occur.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
1. **Pointer validation**: Add checks to ensure `e1` and `e2` are non-null before dereferencing:
   ```c
   if (!e1 || !e2) {
       return; // Early return if pointers are null
   }
   ```
2. **Variable initialization**: Ensure `e1` and `e2` are initialized properly before entering the function.
3. **Safe memory management**: Confirm that `e1` and `e2` point to valid dynamically allocated memory before calling `expr_free` on them.
4. **Add assertions**: Use assertions to enforce conditions that `e1` and `e2` are valid pointers:
   ```c
   assert(e1 != NULL && e2 != NULL);
   ```
5. **Check recursion inputs**: Validate the inputs to recursive calls (`&e1->left.expr`, `&e2`) to prevent unintended behavior with invalid nested structures.
