UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The parameter `data` is implicitly incremented in the second loop (`data++`). This causes undefined behavior if `data` points to invalid or non-accessible regions beyond `size` bytes after the initial pointer. This indirect pointer arithmetic lacks bounds definition and could lead to out-of-bounds access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Memory Access
Bug Reason: If the size argument passed to the function does not correctly reflect the length of the `data` buffer or if `size < 0` due to external factors, the `data` increment and subsequent dereferencing can result in out-of-bounds access, resulting in memory corruption or crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check for the `size` input argument to ensure it is a valid positive integer. Verify the validity of the `data` pointer before iterating and dereferencing. For example:
```c
if (data == NULL || size <= 0)
    return;
```
