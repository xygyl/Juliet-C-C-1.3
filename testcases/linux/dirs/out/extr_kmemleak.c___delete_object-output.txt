Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_kmemleak.c___delete_object.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `WARN_ON` macro may indirectly invoke undefined behavior. Specifically, `atomic_read(&object->use_count)` uses `atomic_read`, potentially allowing for a race condition if `use_count` is modified concurrently without proper synchronization. Additionally, using `lock` belongs likely inline_exit() bugs.  

Bug Detected: Medium
