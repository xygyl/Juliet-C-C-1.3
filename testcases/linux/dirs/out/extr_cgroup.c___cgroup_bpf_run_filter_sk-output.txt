UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code accesses `cgrp->bpf.effective[type]` without any bounds check for `type`. This can cause undefined behavior if `type` is out of bounds for the `effective` array. The behavior of indexing out of bounds is undefined according to the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: The `effective` array is indexed using `type` without validating that `type` is within the proper range. If `type` exceeds the size of the array, this results in an out-of-bounds read, potentially causing application crashes or security vulnerabilities.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking for `type` before accessing `cgrp->bpf.effective`. For example:
```c
if (type < 0 || type >= ARRAY_SIZE(cgrp->bpf.effective)) {
    return -EPERM;
}
```
The macro `ARRAY_SIZE` typically computes the number of elements in the array, ensuring safe access. Alternatively, explicitly define the expected range of valid `type` values in comments or documentation, and include a runtime check accordingly.
