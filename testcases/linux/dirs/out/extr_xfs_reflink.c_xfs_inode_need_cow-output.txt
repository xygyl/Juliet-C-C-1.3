UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not initialize the pointer `shared` before dereferencing it (e.g., `*shared = true`). If `shared` is passed uninitialized by the caller or points to an invalid memory location, the behavior is undefined.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference / Use of Uninitialized Variable
Bug Reason: If the `shared` pointer is not properly initialized or validated before being used, dereferencing it could lead to segmentation faults or undefined behavior. This can happen if the caller fails to ensure `shared` points to valid memory.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate the `shared` pointer at the beginning of the function, ensuring that it is not null, or update the function's contract/documentation to require a valid pointer. Alternatively, initialize `*shared` safely as part of the function code before assigning values.

Example Fix:
```c
if (!shared) {
    return false; // or handle the error accordingly
}
```
