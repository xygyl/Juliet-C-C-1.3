**UB Analysis:**
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate whether the `en` value, used as an index to access the arrays `hpd_regs`, results in an out-of-bounds access. If `en` exceeds the valid bounds of `hpd_regs`, the behavior will be undefined per the C standard. This risk arises from attempting to read or dereference an invalid array index.  

**Bug Analysis:**
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The function directly uses the `en` parameter to index into the `hpd_regs` array without any bounds checking. If `en` is invalid or too large for the array, it will lead to a read or write beyond the allocated memory, potentially causing crashes or corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

**Confidence: High**  
The detection has high confidence because the lack of bounds checking on `en` is a straightforward issue.

**Fix Suggestion:**  
Add a bounds check for the `en` parameter before performing array indexing. For example:  
```c
if (en >= ARRAY_SIZE(hpd_regs)) {
    // Handle error, e.g., return, or set default values
    return;
}
```  
Alternatively, ensure `en` is guaranteed to be within bounds through calling function contracts or comments clarifying valid ranges.
