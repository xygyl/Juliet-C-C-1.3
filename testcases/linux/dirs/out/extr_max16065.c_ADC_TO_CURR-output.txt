Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_max16065.c_ADC_TO_CURR.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow is possible during the multiplication operation (`adc * 1400000`), as `adc` and constants are implicitly treated as `int` unless explicitly defined otherwise. Signed integer overflow is undefined behavior in C.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: The multiplication operation can exceed the maximum value of a signed 32-bit integer (`INT_MAX`), leading to unintended results and potential runtime issues.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Explicitly cast `adc` to a larger integer type (e.g., `long long` or `uint64_t`) or ensure `adc` and constants are defined with types that prevent overflow (e.g., using `long` or `long long` for the arithmetic operation).
