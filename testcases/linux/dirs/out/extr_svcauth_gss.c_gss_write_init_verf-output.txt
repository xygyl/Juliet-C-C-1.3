UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `gss_svc_searchbyctx()` returns `NULL` (indicated by the check `if (rsci == NULL)`), its output is dereferenced later without validation through `rsci->h` in the call to `cache_put(&rsci->h, cd)`. Dereferencing a NULL pointer results in undefined behavior as per the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `rsci` is `NULL` (as validated in `if (rsci == NULL)`), dereferencing `rsci->h` in the subsequent `cache_put()` call will result in undefined behavior and could crash the program. This is a clear logic bug resulting from improper handling of the `NULL` return case.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add a guard condition to ensure `cache_put()` is not called when `rsci` is `NULL`. For example:  

```c
if (rsci != NULL) {
    cache_put(&rsci->h, cd);
}
```  
Alternatively, restructure the logic to ensure no code after the `if (rsci == NULL)` condition accesses `rsci`.
