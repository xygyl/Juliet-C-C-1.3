UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereference of a potentially null pointer `msgs` when checking `msgs->buf`. If `msgs` itself is null, accessing `msgs->buf` leads to undefined behavior. Also, an implicit assumption is made that `left_num >= 0` during the loop (`while (left_num--`), which may problematically lead to a wraparound if signed integer underflows occur in specific contexts.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference, Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: Null pointer dereference can occur for `msgs` if it is null. Additionally, the decrementing logic `while (left_num--)` might theoretically wrap around signed integers if `left_num` is negative at entry, leading to unpredictable looping behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a sanity check at the beginning of the function to ensure `msgs` is not null (`if (!msgs) { return -EINVAL; }`). Additionally, ensure `left_num` is positive before decrementing the counter (`if (left_num < 0) { return -EINVAL; }`). This will prevent the undefined behavior and associated bug from manifesting.
