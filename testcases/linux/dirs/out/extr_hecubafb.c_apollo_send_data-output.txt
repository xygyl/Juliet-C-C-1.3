UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible dereferencing of a null pointer (`par` or `par->board`) is undefined behavior. Since the function does not validate the `par` or `par->board` pointers before using them, there is a risk that these pointers could be null. This causes undefined behavior if they are dereferenced.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If either the `par` or `par->board` pointers are null, the function will attempt to dereference them, leading to a null pointer dereference bug and a potential crash. This is a logic flaw since the function does not check the validity of the input pointers.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add checks for the validity of the `par` and `par->board` pointers at the beginning of the function. For example:  
```c  
if (par == NULL || par->board == NULL) {  
    return; // Or handle the error appropriately  
}  
```
