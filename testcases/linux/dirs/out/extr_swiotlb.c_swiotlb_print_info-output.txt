### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. The values `io_tlb_start`, `io_tlb_end`, `io_tlb_nslabs`, and `no_iotlb_memory` are declared as scalar types (`scalar_t__`), but their actual initialization is missing from this function (presumably defined elsewhere). If any of these variables are uninitialized or incorrectly initialized, their usage (e.g., in `pr_info` or the condition `if (no_iotlb_memory)`) can lead to undefined behavior.  
2. Left-shifting the value of `io_tlb_nslabs` by `IO_TLB_SHIFT` (`io_tlb_nslabs << IO_TLB_SHIFT`) is undefined behavior in case `io_tlb_nslabs` exceeds the width of the type `unsigned long` (e.g., shifting by or beyond the number of bits in a `long`).  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason:  
The function does not validate the value of `IO_TLB_SHIFT`, which can lead to undefined or erroneous results during the shift operation (`io_tlb_nslabs << IO_TLB_SHIFT`). If `IO_TLB_SHIFT` is incorrect or too large, it may cause a calculation error (e.g., resulting in an overflow). Additionally, there is no check to ensure that `io_tlb_start` and `io_tlb_end` are valid memory addresses before using them in `pr_info`. If these values are corrupted or uninitialized, the output message will be incorrect or meaningless.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: Medium  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Ensure `io_tlb_nslabs`, `io_tlb_start`, `io_tlb_end`, and `no_iotlb_memory` are properly initialized before calling `swiotlb_print_info`. This might require adding safety checks (e.g., `assert(io_tlb_start != NULL)` or similar).  
2. Validate `IO_TLB_SHIFT` and ensure it is within an acceptable range (e.g., `IO_TLB_SHIFT < sizeof(unsigned long) * CHAR_BIT`).  
3. Add validation that `io_tlb_start` and `io_tlb_end` are non-NULL and contain valid memory ranges before using them.
