**UB Analysis**

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function appears to call `dm_bitset_resize()` without checking the range or validity of its input arguments (`cmd->discard_root`, `from_dblock(cmd->discard_nr_blocks)`, `from_dblock(new_nr_entries)`), which could lead to undefined behavior if these values are out of range or invalid according to `dm_bitset_resize`'s contract. Additionally, `from_dblock()` is not defined here, and if it results in computation with invalid inputs (such as signed integer overflow), it could trigger UB. The handling of `discard_root` also seems critical, as writing back to it without checking might involve undefined actions if prior states are inconsistent.  

**Bug Analysis**

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: Input validation is missing for the supplied arguments such as `new_nr_entries`, `discard_root`, and results produced by `from_dblock()`. Without such checks, the function depends on the assumption that inputs are valid, which increases the risk of invoking undefined or unreliable behavior inside `dm_bitset_resize()`. It also implicitly assumes that `dm_bitset_resize()` will not fail due to invalid internal states. This could lead to a subtle logic error where `cmd->changed = true` is set when operations might have failed.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  

**Fix Suggestion:**  
1. Validate `new_nr_entries`, `discard_root`, and any computed values from `from_dblock()` before passing them to `dm_bitset_resize()`. Check ranges and non-null assumptions wherever applicable.
2. After calling `dm_bitset_resize()`, ensure its return value is interpreted correctly. If `cmd->changed` is set despite failure in resizing, it could lead to misleading behavior downstream.
3. If the `WRITE_LOCK` and `WRITE_UNLOCK` macros depend on any specific context or state, ensure that any failures within these macros do not lead to inconsistencies when the function exits early.
