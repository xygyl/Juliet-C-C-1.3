### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is potential undefined behavior caused by dereferencing invalid pointers. Specifically:  
1. The `dev` object is accessed via `st95context->spicontext.spidev->dev`, where the pointer `spicontext.spidev` is assumed to be valid. If this pointer is not properly initialized or is NULL, dereferencing it will trigger undefined behavior.  
2. Accessing `cmd_array[CMD_ISO14443B_PROTOCOL_SELECT].cmd_params[2]` assumes `cmd_array` and its specific sub-elements are properly initialized and allocated. If `cmd_array` is NULL or points to invalid memory, or the indices are out of bounds, this results in undefined behavior.  
3. The function does not confirm whether `nfcddev->curr_protocol` has a valid value before using it in a switch statement. If the value is invalid (e.g., not `NFC_PROTO_ISO14443` or `NFC_PROTO_ISO14443_B`), it falls through the default case, potentially causing undefined behavior depending on `st95context` state management outside this code.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: There is insufficient validation and error handling for the pointers (`st95context`, `spicontext.spidev`, `cmd_array`) and variables involved in initialization (e.g., `curr_protocol`). Additionally:  
1. The function assumes `cmd_array` and its members are adequately initialized but does not validate this assumption, leading to possible memory access bugs like buffer overflow or access violations.  
2. If `nfcddev->curr_protocol` contains an invalid value, the switch statement will fall to the default case and return `-EINVAL`. However, this behavior might be unexpected as the code does not explicitly check validity of input before the switch case.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Add pointer validity checks throughout the function:
   ```c
   if (!st95context || !st95context->spicontext.spidev || !st95context->ddev) {
       return -EINVAL;
   }
   if (!cmd_array || !cmd_array[CMD_ISO14443B_PROTOCOL_SELECT].cmd_params) {
       return -EINVAL;
   }
   ```
2. Validate `curr_protocol` before using it in the switch case:
   ```c
   if (nfcddev->curr_protocol != NFC_PROTO_ISO14443 &&
       nfcddev->curr_protocol != NFC_PROTO_ISO14443_B) {
       return -EINVAL;
   }
   ```
3. Ensure proper initialization of `cmd_array` and relevant parameters globally or provide meaningful error handling if those values are unexpectedly invalid.  

This would prevent both undefined behavior and logic flaws in the function execution.
