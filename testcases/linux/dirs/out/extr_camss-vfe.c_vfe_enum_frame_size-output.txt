Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_camss-vfe.c_vfe_enum_frame_size.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function assigns `-1` to `format.width` and `format.height`, which violates the condition set by the standard that these fields must contain valid non-negative sizes for hardware operations or logical processing. This leads to undefined behavior if `vfe_try_format` operates on negative dimensions.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The logic assumes that negative values for width and height (used in `format.width` and `format.height`) are valid inputs to the `vfe_try_format` function. If the underlying function or hardware requires strictly positive values or the code carries assumptions about valid ranges, this could lead to incorrect data or runtime issues such as program crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before calling `vfe_try_format`, ensure `format.width` and `format.height` are capped within non-negative ranges. For example, assign `format.width` and `format.height` to a sufficiently large valid size during maximum width/height calculationsâ€”do not use `-1` to represent an "unbounded size."
