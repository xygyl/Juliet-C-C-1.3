### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences `context->streams[i]` without checking if `context->streams` itself is NULL. If `context->streams` is NULL, accessing `context->streams[i]` would cause undefined behavior due to a NULL pointer dereference.  

### Bug Analysis

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not check if `context->streams` is NULL before iterating over it. If `context->streams` is NULL (and this condition is possible given no guarantees are made about `context` or its fields), the loop would cause a null pointer dereference when attempting to access the `streams` array.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `context->streams` is not NULL before iterating over the array. Example:  

```c
if (!context || !context->streams) {
    return;
}
```  

Alternatively, strengthen the assumption that `context->streams` will never be NULL by documenting or enforcing this constraint in the caller function.
