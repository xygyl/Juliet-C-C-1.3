UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `is_freerunning_event()` function is called on the `event` pointer, but there is no check for whether `event` is `NULL`. If `is_freerunning_event()` attempts to dereference `event` and `event` is `NULL`, this leads to undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether the `event` pointer is `NULL` before passing it to `is_freerunning_event()`. If `event` is `NULL` and `is_freerunning_event()` performs any dereferences, it causes a null pointer dereference bug.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `event` is not `NULL`:
```c
if (event == NULL) {
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
This ensures that `is_freerunning_event()` is only called with a valid pointer.
