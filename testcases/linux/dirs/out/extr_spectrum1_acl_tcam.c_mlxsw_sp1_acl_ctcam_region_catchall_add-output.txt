UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Use of `WARN_ON(err)` in this code can potentially lead to undefined behavior if `err` represents an invalid state that causes the macro to operate incorrectly. However, `WARN_ON` typically does not directly cause UB, but it acts as a debugging tool. The primary source of UB can arise if `mlxsw_sp_acl_rulei_commit(rulei)` changes memory or other states incorrectly based on unvalidated inputs.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: If an error happens in the `mlxsw_sp_acl_rulei_act_continue(rulei)` call, memory allocated by `mlxsw_sp_acl_rulei_create()` is immediately cleaned, resetting unsafe method later resulting unsafe end-lines code ?
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Use consistent error-checking and ensure cleanup operations `goto path clearer simplifying test boundary` keep-memoration stableground.
