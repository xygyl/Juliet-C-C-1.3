### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not execute operations leading to undefined behavior as per the C standard. All pointer checks, including verifying allocations and responses (`IS_ERR()` on `resp` and `!skb` for `skb`), appear to be in place, and their usage is valid. No indirect or unaligned memory accesses, signed integer overflow, or uninitialized variable accesses are present.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Leak  
Bug Reason: After invoking `pn533_send_cmd_sync()` and checking `IS_ERR(resp)`, the function returns the error code without freeing the previously allocated `skb`. This results in a potential memory leak due to the allocation of `skb` via `pn533_alloc_skb()` being left unfreed.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Before the `return PTR_ERR(resp)` line, add a statement to free the allocated `skb` using `dev_kfree_skb(skb)`. The updated code could look like this:
```c
if (IS_ERR(resp)) {
    dev_kfree_skb(skb);  // Free the allocated skb to avoid a memory leak
    return PTR_ERR(resp);
}
```

This ensures proper deallocation of the memory even in error paths to prevent memory leaks.
