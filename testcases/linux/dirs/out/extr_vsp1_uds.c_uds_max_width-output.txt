Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vsp1_uds.c_uds_max_width.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: There is a potential division by zero when calculating `hscale` as `output->width / input->width`. If `input->width` is zero and there is no explicit check to handle this case, undefined behavior occurs due to dividing by zero.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The division operation `output->width / input->width` lacks validation of `input->width` being greater than zero. This could lead to a runtime error or incorrect behavior if `input->width` is zero. The program does not ensure input and output frame formats are properly initialized or validated before use.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `input->width` is greater than zero before performing the division. For example:
```c
if (input->width == 0)
    return 0; // Or another appropriate value/error handling
hscale = output->width / input->width;
```
