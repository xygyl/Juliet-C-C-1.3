### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function avoids undefined behavior by design:
- It performs proper checks for alignment using `IS_ALIGNED`.
- It does not dereference null pointers.
- There is no signed integer overflow or out-of-bounds memory access.
- Loop terminates when `sg` becomes `NULL`, and it appropriately handles input validation (`!total` and alignment checks).  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The `len` variable is declared as `int`, but its value accumulates the `length` field of `struct scatterlist`, which is of type `size_t` (unsigned). This may cause incorrect behavior when `len` overflows or when `total` is a large value exceeding the range of `int`. Specifically:
- For architectures where `size_t` is 64-bit and `int` is 32-bit, `len` may overflow, leading to the comparison `len != total` being incorrect and potentially returning erroneous `-EINVAL`.
- This is not undefined behavior but is nonetheless a significant logic flaw that could break the function with large inputs.

Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Change the type of `len` from `int` to `size_t`, which matches the type of `total` and the `length` field in `struct scatterlist`. This ensures no overflow occurs during accumulation and allows for consistent behavior with large inputs:

```c
size_t len = 0;
```
