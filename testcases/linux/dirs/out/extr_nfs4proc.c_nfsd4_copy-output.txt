Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nfs4proc.c_nfsd4_copy.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function contains potential undefined behavior when using `kthread_create`. If `async_copy->copy_task` is returned as an error pointer (`IS_ERR()` evaluates true), there is no explicit cleanup or error handling for partially initialized members of `async_copy`. Additionally, use of memcpy on `copy->cp_res.cb_stateid` might invoke UB if `copy->cp_stateid` isn't properly initialized prior to this call. Any uninitialized field touched by `memcpy` may lead to UB during access.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Management Bug
Bug Reason: If `kthread_create` fails (`IS_ERR(async_copy->copy_task)` evaluates true), the memory allocated for `async_copy` is leaked because `kfree(async_copy)` is missing in the `out_err` error-handling branch. Additionally, if `async_copy` is added to `async_copies` list (`list_add`) under the wrong assumption (if `copy_task` was not properly created), this might create a dangling reference later.
Bug Caused by UB: Possibly
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Revisit all points of allocation (`kzalloc`) and ensure proper cleanup in error cases. Add `kfree(async_copy)` in the error branch (`out_err`). Verify initialization of all fields before using `memcpy`. Alternatively:
```c
if (IS_ERR(async_copy->copy_task)) {
    cleanup_async_copy(async_copy);
    kfree(async_copy);  // Add explicit memory deallocation here.
    goto out;
}
```
Additionally, ensure that the `copy->cp_stateid` fields are initialized before calling `memcpy` to avoid UB.
