Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_netiucv.c_netiucv_printname.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
- **Out-of-bounds memory read/write:** The `memcpy(tmp, name, len)` operation assumes that `len` bytes can be safely copied from the `name` pointer into the `tmp` array. However, `tmp` has a fixed size of 17 bytes, and if `len > 17`, this will result in a buffer overflow, which leads to undefined behavior in C.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason:  
- The size of the buffer `tmp` (17 bytes) is fixed. If `len` is greater than 17, the `memcpy` operation will overflow the buffer, causing potential memory corruption. Additionally, the loop `while (*p && ((p - tmp) < len) && (!isspace(*p)))` does not adequately restrict access within the bounds of `tmp`, risking out-of-bounds access.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
- Ensure that the value of `len` does not exceed the size of `tmp`. For example:
```c
if (len > sizeof(tmp) - 1) {
    len = sizeof(tmp) - 1;
}
memcpy(tmp, name, len);
tmp[len] = '\0';
```
This ensures that `tmp` will not be overflowed and remains null-terminated.
