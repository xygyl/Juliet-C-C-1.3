UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The macro `LOCK_UNLOCK_2` is invoked with mutex objects `a`, `b`, and `c`, but its implementation is not provided in the code excerpt. If the macro operates on the same mutex in multiple threads without proper management, there could be undefined behavior due to potential deadlocks or undefined locking order. Moreover, invoking `LOCK_UNLOCK_2` may perform invalid operations on these mutexes, such as trying to lock/unlock already destroyed or uninitialized mutexes, though no explicit evidence exists here. Without the macro's definition, this opens the possibility of UB.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The use of the macro `LOCK_UNLOCK_2` with the mutexes `a`, `b`, and `c` creates ambiguous concurrency behavior since the macro's functionality is unknown. If the macro, for example, locks and unlocks two mutexes in different orders, this could cause a deadlock if used improperly across threads. Furthermore, the locking order in `LOCK_UNLOCK_2(a, b)`, `LOCK_UNLOCK_2(c, a)`, and `LOCK_UNLOCK_2(b, c)` suggests a cyclical locking dependency that increases the risk of deadlocks in a multi-threaded environment. Lack of documentation makes this unsafe practice.

Bug Caused by UB: Partially. The lack of clarity or specification in the macro `LOCK_UNLOCK_2` implementation could introduce undefined behavior, potentially causing bugs, but the cyclical locking dependency specifically creates the logic flaw.

Confidence: Medium

Fix Suggestion: 
1. Provide a clear and deterministic implementation for `LOCK_UNLOCK_2` such that the locking and unlocking order of the mutexes is explicitly documented and enforced.
2. Avoid cyclical locking order dependencies to minimize deadlock risks. Introduce a global convention for mutexes to prevent circular dependencies (e.g., always lock `a` before `b`, `b` before `c`, etc.).
3. Double-check that all mutex initializations and destructions are valid and occur in a safe, controlled manner.
