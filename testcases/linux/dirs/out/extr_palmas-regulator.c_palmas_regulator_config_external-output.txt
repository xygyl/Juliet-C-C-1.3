UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing `ddata->palmas_regs_info[id]` without ensuring that `id` is within valid bounds can lead to undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds access. The code assumes `id` is a valid index but does not perform a bounds check for the array `palmas_regs_info`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: In case `id` exceeds the valid range of indices for `palmas_regs_info`, this results in accessing memory outside the array bounds. This could lead to a crash, corruption, or unintended behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check for `id` before accessing `palmas_regs_info` to ensure `id` lies within the valid range of array indices. For example:
```c
if (id < 0 || id >= ARRAY_SIZE(ddata->palmas_regs_info)) {
    dev_err(palmas->dev, "Invalid regulator ID %d\n", id);
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
Then proceed with the rest of the function logic.
