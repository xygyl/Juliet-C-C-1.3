UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The cast `(int)_arg` assumes that `_arg` is a valid pointer holding an integer. If `_arg` is not properly initialized or points to a non-integer memory area, the behavior is undefined. Additionally, dereferencing it is indirect and unsafe because it can lead to pointer type aliasing violations.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: It is unclear whether `_arg` is being safely used as an integer type. No explicit dereferencing occurs, but the cast itself does not validate that `_arg` actually holds a meaningful integer representation. If `_arg` is malformed or invalid, the comparison could lead to incorrect behavior or crashes.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `_arg` is always passed as a properly initialized and validated integer (e.g., passing its address directly). Explicit checks for `_arg` being non-NULL could also help ensure validity before performing the cast.
