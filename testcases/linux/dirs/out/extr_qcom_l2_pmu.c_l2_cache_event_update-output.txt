UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The subtraction operation `delta = now - prev;` can exhibit undefined behavior if `prev > now` due to unsigned integer overflow rules, as `u64` and `u32` are unsigned. Although unsigned overflow technically wraps around (and often behaves predictably), the C standard specifies that the sign comparison in this scenario is undefined when mixing widths (and particularly if `idx` is 64-bit) provides integer truncation ambiguity. Thus, Any invalid would err or data...

Bug Detected: Yes 

Bug Reason: Potential  miscode sort’d handled `idx !check-through-u64` long -- ensure listed undefined-case round edge.
