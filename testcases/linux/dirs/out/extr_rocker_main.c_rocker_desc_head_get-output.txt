UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `info->desc_info` is NULL or improperly initialized, accessing `info->desc_info[info->head]` will lead to undefined behavior due to invalid pointer dereference. Similarly, accessing `info->size` without proper initialization could result in UB if it has an invalid value. Additionally, the arithmetic inside `__pos_inc` could cause undefined behavior if the size is zero, as division/modulo operations by zero are undefined.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: There is no check to ensure that `info` or `info->desc_info` is non-NULL before accessing its members. If `info` or `info->desc_info` is NULL, this code will cause a null pointer dereference. Additionally, without validation of `info->size`, errors such as division by zero might occur in `__pos_inc`.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to validate that `info`, `info->desc_info`, and `info->size` are properly initialized and non-NULL at the beginning of the function. For example:
```c
if (!info || !info->desc_info || info->size == 0)
    return NULL;
```
