UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function performs bitwise operations and shifts within type limits, manages signedness correctly, prevents integer overflows explicitly, and avoids accessing invalid memory addresses. No undefined behavior as per the C standard is detected in the function.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Pointer Arithmetic Error  
Bug Reason: The `dst` parameter is of type `void *`, and pointer arithmetic is performed directly on `void *` in expressions like `dst + 0`, `dst + 4`, `dst + 8`, and `dst + 12`. In C, direct arithmetic on `void *` is not valid because the size of `void` is incomplete. As a result, such operations yield undefined behavior according to the C standard since pointer arithmetic assumes a complete-type size for offsets. This issue can potentially lead to incorrect addressing and access when the function writes values using `put_unaligned_le32`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Cast the `void *` pointer to a pointer of an appropriate type (e.g., `unsigned char *` or `uint8_t *`) before performing pointer arithmetic, such as `((uint8_t *)dst) + 4`.

Corrected Example:
```c
put_unaligned_le32((h0 >>  0) | (h1 << 26), ((uint8_t *)dst) +  0);
put_unaligned_le32((h1 >>  6) | (h2 << 20), ((uint8_t *)dst) +  4);
put_unaligned_le32((h2 >> 12) | (h3 << 14), ((uint8_t *)dst) +  8);
put_unaligned_le32((h3 >> 18) | (h4 <<  8), ((uint8_t *)dst) + 12);
```
