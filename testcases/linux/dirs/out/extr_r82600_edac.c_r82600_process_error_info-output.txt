UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The usage of the bit-shift operator with signed integers (e.g., `info->eapr >> 12`) could lead to implementation-defined or undefined behavior if `info->eapr` is negative. The `info->eapr` field has not been explicitly declared as unsigned, and signed right shifts in C are implementation-defined. Furthermore, `PAGE_SHIFT` is used as the right operand for a bit-shift operation (`eapaddr >> PAGE_SHIFT`), which may lead to undefined behavior if `PAGE_SHIFT` is negative or overly large, though it seems unlikely in this context given kernel conventions.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The mask `0x7FFF` used to extract bits (`((info->eapr >> 12) & 0x7FFF) << 13`) does not fully account for the upper 19 bits of a 32-bit error address. Since it's masking only 15 bits, it might result in incorrect computation of the `eapaddr`, leading to erroneous error processing or memory addressing. Additionally, there is no explicit check that `info->eapr` is valid or initialized before use, leading to potential bugs if `info->eapr` contains garbage data.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Ensure `info->eapr` is an unsigned integer to avoid implementation-defined behavior during right shifts (`u32` type would suffice).  
2. Verify the range or initialization of `info->eapr` before performing any operations to avoid processing invalid values.  
3. Correct the mask `0x7FFF` to account for 19 bits if the upper 19 bits represent the error address (`((info->eapr >> 12) & 0x7FFFF)` instead of `((info->eapr >> 12) & 0x7FFF)`).
