UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds access in `ncf->vids[cmd->index - 1]` when `cmd->index` exceeds `ncf->n_vids` due to unsigned subtraction. The check `cmd->index > ncf->n_vids` does not prevent a case where `cmd->index - 1` becomes negative because `cmd->index` is unsigned.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access
Bug Reason: Accessing `ncf->vids[cmd->index - 1]` is unsafe if `cmd->index - 1` exceeds the bounds of the array. Even though earlier logic attempts to ensure the range is valid, the `cmd->index - 1` computation introduces risk for unsigned underflow and its implications.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add stricter validation by explicitly checking `cmd->index - 1 >= ncf->n_vids` or introducing bounds guarantees before interacting with `ncf->vids`.
