Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_uprobes.c_adjust_psw_addr.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The call to `__rewind_psw(*psw, -len)` may cause undefined behavior due to the negative value passed as the second argument. Subtracting `len` (an unsigned long) results in a type promotion to unsigned arithmetic, which may cause wraparound behavior and produce an unintended large positive value.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The indirectly passed negative value (`-len`, with `len` defined as unsigned long) could result in wrong computation inside `__rewind_psw`, leading to unintended results. The logic is incorrect as the arithmetic is performed on unsigned types.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Change the type of `len` to `long` or ensure `len` is appropriate for subtraction operations by validating it before calling `__rewind_psw`. Alternatively, explicitly cast `-len` to `(long)` at the call site to prevent unsigned wraparound.
