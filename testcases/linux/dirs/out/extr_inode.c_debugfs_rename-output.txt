Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_inode.c_debugfs_rename.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not check if `new_name` is a null pointer before passing it to `strlen`. If `new_name` is `NULL`, calling `strlen(new_name)` results in undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer. This violates the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: Same as the UB reasonâ€”passing a null pointer (`new_name`) to `strlen` causes null pointer dereferencing, which results in undefined behavior and leads to a functional bug in the logic when `new_name` is `NULL`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `new_name` at the beginning of the function:  
```c  
if (!new_name)  
    return ERR_PTR(-EINVAL);  
```
