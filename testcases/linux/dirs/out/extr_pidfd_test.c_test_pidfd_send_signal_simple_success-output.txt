### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:
- **Modification of a shared variable in a signal handler** (`signal_received`): Modifying non-atomic variables (`signal_received`) inside a signal handler can lead to undefined behavior due to a lack of proper synchronization with the rest of the program.
- **Strict aliasing rule violation**: There are no clear violations of strict aliasing in this snippet.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Concurrency Issue, Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason:
- **Concurrency Issue**: `signal_received` is modified by the signal handler (`set_signal_received_on_sigusr1`) and read in the main thread without synchronization mechanisms, leading to potential race conditions or inconsistent behavior.
- **Logic Flaw**: `signal_received` is assumed to be correctly updated by the signal handler, but the lack of atomicity may lead to unreliability in the logic flow (e.g., the test may incorrectly fail if the value of `signal_received` isn't properly updated).

Bug Caused by UB: Yes (Concurrency-related UB causes inconsistent behavior).  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
- Use `sig_atomic_t` for `signal_received` to ensure atomic updates during signal handling:
  ```c
  volatile sig_atomic_t signal_received;
  ```

- Alternatively, use synchronization mechanisms such as `pthread` constructs if the signal handler interacts with shared resources extensively.

- Validate that `signal()` is replaced with `sigaction()` for safer signal handling:
  ```c
  struct sigaction sa;
  sa.sa_handler = set_signal_received_on_sigusr1;
  sa.sa_flags = SA_RESTART; // Optional, for restartable syscalls
  sigaction(SIGUSR1, &sa, NULL);
  ```

By improving atomicity and synchronization, both the UB and concurrency issue can be mitigated.
