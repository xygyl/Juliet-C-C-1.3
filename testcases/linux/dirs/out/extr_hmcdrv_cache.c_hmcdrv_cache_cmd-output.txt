Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hmcdrv_cache.c_hmcdrv_cache_cmd.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Negative value assignment to an unsigned member (`ofs` in `hmcdrv_cache_file`). Signed-to-unsigned conversion results in undefined behavior if assigned value is not representable in the unsigned type.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic and Type Safety  
Bug Reason: Assigning `-1` (signed integer) to the unsigned member `ofs` may lead to wraparound, causing unintended behavior when the `ofs` field is used later in the program. This could confuse logic and lead to bugs.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Explicitly cast `-1` to the correct type (e.g., `(uintptr_t)-1`) or use a sentinel value that is safely representable within the unsigned type's range for the purpose of invalidation.
