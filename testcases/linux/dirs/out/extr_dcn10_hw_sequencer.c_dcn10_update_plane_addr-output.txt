UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: `pipe_ctx->plane_state` is dereferenced without checking if it is `NULL`, which can lead to undefined behavior if it is indeed `NULL`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: `pipe_ctx->plane_state` pointer is dereferenced before verifying whether it is `NULL`. If the pointer is `NULL` during execution, the program will crash, resulting in undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a `NULL` check for `pipe_ctx->plane_state` similar to the existing guard for `plane_state`. For example:
```c
if (pipe_ctx->plane_state == NULL)
    return;
```
