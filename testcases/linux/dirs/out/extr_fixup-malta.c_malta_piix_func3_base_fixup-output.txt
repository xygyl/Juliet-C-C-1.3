UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function does not trigger undefined behavior provided that the `dev` parameter is a valid and correctly initialized pointer to a `struct pci_dev`. It performs PCI configuration writes using `pci_write_config_word()` and `pci_write_config_byte()`, which are safe as long as the underlying PCI hardware exists and the input values are within expected ranges.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not check if the `struct pci_dev *dev` parameter is `NULL` before dereferencing it in `pci_write_config_word()` and `pci_write_config_byte()`. If `dev` is `NULL`, these operations would lead to a null-pointer dereference.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for the `dev` parameter at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!dev) {
    return;
}
```
