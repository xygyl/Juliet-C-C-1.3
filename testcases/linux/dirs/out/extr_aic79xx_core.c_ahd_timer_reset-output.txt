Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_aic79xx_core.c_ahd_timer_reset.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow may occur in the expression `(usec * HZ)`, as multiplying large values of `usec` and `HZ` can exceed the range of signed integers.
Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: None
Bug Reason: No logic or memory-related bugs observed. The function appears correct assuming `usec` and `HZ` remain within reasonable limits.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: To prevent signed integer overflow, cast `usec` or `HZ` to an unsigned type before performing the multiplication, as follows:  
`timer->expires = jiffies + ((unsigned long)usec * (unsigned long)HZ)/1000000;`
