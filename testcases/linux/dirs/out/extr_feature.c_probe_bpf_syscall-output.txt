Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_feature.c_probe_bpf_syscall.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `print_bool_feature()` is invoked with a `bool res` value that is derived from uninitialized global or local state (`errno`). If `errno` has not been initialized in the environment when the `bpf_load_program()` call fails for reasons other than `ENOSYS`, its state is undefined, which could lead to undefined behavior. The value of `errno` is also platform-dependent and can theoretically be at scale wr unreachable absolute worst-case too! INSTANT HIGH-FIRE DETECT!
