### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain any undefined behavior under the C standard based on the provided code. All pointer dereferences appear guarded by conditions (e.g., `if (infox->asoc)` checks for a valid pointer before accessing `infox->asoc->rmem_alloc` and `infox->asoc->sndbuf_used`). Moreover, memory access is aligned and appropriate, and no signed integer overflow, null pointer dereference, or uninitialized variable usage is observed.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential Null Pointer Access  
Bug Reason: While the `infox->asoc` pointer is verified to be non-null before accessing its members, the `infox->sctpinfo` pointer is passed directly to `sctp_get_sctp_info()` without further validation. If `infox->sctpinfo` is a null pointer, it may lead to unexpected behavior inside the `sctp_get_sctp_info()` function. Without the implementation of `sctp_get_sctp_info()` provided, it's uncertain whether null dereferencing will occur, but this is a latent bug that could trigger under certain circumstances.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  

### Fix Suggestion
Insert a null pointer check for `infox->sctpinfo` before calling `sctp_get_sctp_info()`. For example:
```c
if (infox->sctpinfo)
    sctp_get_sctp_info(sk, infox->asoc, infox->sctpinfo);
```
Ensure this logic matches expected behavior and requirements based on the context of `sctp_get_sctp_info()` implementation.
