Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dcn10_hubbub.c_hubbub1_get_blk256_size.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Writing to the memory locations pointed by `blk256_width` and `blk256_height` without validating if the pointers are NULL results in undefined behavior, as dereferencing NULL pointers is undefined behavior in C.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If either `blk256_width` or `blk256_height` is passed as a NULL pointer, dereferencing and assigning values to them would result in a runtime crash due to a null pointer dereference, which is a memory-related bug.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a validation check at the start of the function to ensure that both pointers are non-NULL before attempting to dereference them. For example:  
```c
if (blk256_width == NULL || blk256_height == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
