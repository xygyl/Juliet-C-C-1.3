UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function violates array bounds in several places when `sz < len` occurs, leading to dereferencing or incrementing pointers beyond allocated bounds. Specifically, dereferencing `p` or incrementing `p` after size checks (`sz < len`) can cause undefined behavior if the memory pointed to by `p` is out of bounds.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer overflow
Bug Reason: The same array bounds violation described above can lead to buffer overflows and potential segmentation faults if `p` accesses memory out of bounds (e.g., in the loop or `len--` operations when control doesn't appropriately validate bounds).
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Ensure that every `sz < len` check returns the function immediately before attempting to process `p`. For example, add safety clauses like `if (sz < len) return H323_ERROR_BOUND`.
2. Strictly validate `p` and `sz` bounds in every segment of the function, especially in the `while` loop, to avoid memory violations or buffer overflows.
