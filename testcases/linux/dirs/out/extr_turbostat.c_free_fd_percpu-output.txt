Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_turbostat.c_free_fd_percpu.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds access in the `fd_percpu[i]` array. The function assumes that the array `fd_percpu` has a size of at least `topo.max_cpu_num + 1`, but there is no guarantee this is the case. Accessing beyond the allocated bounds causes undefined behavior. Additionally, calling `close()` on an invalid file descriptor (e.g., memory that was accidentally overwritten) would be undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: If `fd_percpu` does not have enough elements (i.e., if its size is less than `topo.max_cpu_num + 1`), accessing `fd_percpu[i]` results in an out-of-bounds access, which is a serious bug. Furthermore, passing invalid file descriptors to `close()` can also lead to resource leaks or crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the `fd_percpu` array is properly allocated to a size of `topo.max_cpu_num + 1` before any read or write access. Additionally, add null-pointer checks to ensure that `fd_percpu` is not `NULL`. Example fix:
```c
void free_fd_percpu(void)
{
    if (fd_percpu == NULL) {
        return; // Early exit if fd_percpu is NULL.
    }

    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < topo.max_cpu_num + 1; ++i) {
        if (i < sizeof(fd_percpu) / sizeof(fd_percpu[0]) && fd_percpu[i] != 0) {
            close(fd_percpu[i]);
        }
    }

    free(fd_percpu);
}
```
