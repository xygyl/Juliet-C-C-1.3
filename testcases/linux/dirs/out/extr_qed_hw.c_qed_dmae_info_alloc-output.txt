Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_qed_hw.c_qed_dmae_info_alloc.c
UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function adheres to the C language standard and there are no clear indications of undefined behavior as defined by the standard. Memory allocation using `dma_alloc_coherent` safely handles its allocations, and no uninitialized pointers are dereferenced.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: If the `dma_alloc_coherent` call for allocating `p_comp` fails, the function jumps to the error label where `qed_dmae_info_free(p_hwfn)` is called. However, memory has not been allocated for other components such as `p_dmae_cmd` or `p_intermediate_buffer` yet, so passing `p_hwfn` to `qed_dmae_info_free` might attempt to free uninitialized pointers or result in a no-op if the function checks initialization.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Enhance the error handling logic to ensure that only successfully allocated pointers are freed. Modify `qed_dmae_info_free` to check whether each specific pointer in `dmae_info` is NULL before attempting to free it or explicitly track which allocations were successful. Alternatively, only call `qed_dmae_info_free` after initializing all `dmae_info` fields conditionally based on successful allocation.

Example:
```c
*q_comp = dma_alloc_coherent(&p_hwfn->cdev->pdev->dev,
			     sizeof(u32), p_addr, GFP_KERNEL);
if (!*p_comp)
	return -ENOMEM;

*p_cmd = dma_alloc_coherent(&p_hwfn->cdev->pdev->dev,
			    sizeof(struct dmae_cmd),
			    &p_hwfn->dmae_info.dmae_cmd_phys_addr, GFP_KERNEL);
if (!*p_cmd) {
	dma_free_coherent(&p_hwfn->cdev->pdev->dev,
			  sizeof(u32), *p_comp, *p_addr);
	return -ENOMEM;
}

*p_buff = dma_alloc_coherent(&p_hwfn->cdev->pdev->dev,
			     sizeof(u32) * DMAE_MAX_RW_SIZE,
			     &p_hwfn->dmae_info.intermediate_buffer_phys_addr,
			     GFP_KERNEL);
if (!*p_buff) {
	dma_free_coherent(&p_hwfn->cdev->pdev->dev,
			  sizeof(struct dmae_cmd), *p_cmd,
			  p_hwfn->dmae_info.dmae_cmd_phys_addr);
	dma_free_coherent(&p_hwfn->cdev->pdev->dev,
			  sizeof(u32), *p_comp, *p_addr);
	return -ENOMEM;
}
```
