### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain any typical cases of undefined behavior such as dereferencing NULL pointers, accessing invalid memory, signed integer overflow, unaligned memory access, or violating strict aliasing rules. While the code involves arithmetic operations on integers (`uint64_t`) and floats (`double`), there is no indication of operations that would result in undefined behavior as per the C standard.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The `_read_count` and `_write_count` variables are assumed to hold valid values. However, if the values do not get initialized or updated appropriately elsewhere in the program, the calculations `rx_rate` and `tx_rate` will use garbage or stale values, resulting in incorrect transfer rate reporting. Additionally, `interval` is a double value and must be non-zero; otherwise, the division can lead to a floating-point division by zero (`interval*1000.0 == 0.0`), which although defined, results in undesirable behavior (`rx_rate` and `tx_rate` becoming infinity).  

Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Ensure that `_read_count` and `_write_count` are properly initialized and updated in the program before calling this function. If this cannot be guaranteed, initialize them within the function with a meaningful default value.
2. Validate that `interval` is non-zero before performing the division:
    ```c
    if (interval == 0.0) {
        printf("Error: interval cannot be zero.\n");
        return;
    }
    ```  
3. Optionally, add additional checks to confirm `_read_count` and `_write_count` have reasonable values before use.
