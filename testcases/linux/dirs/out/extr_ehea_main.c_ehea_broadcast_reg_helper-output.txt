UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not demonstrate any form of undefined behavior according to the C standard:
- No evidence of signed integer overflow, null pointer dereferencing, uninitialized variable use, or strict aliasing violations.
- The `NULL` macro and typedefs are correctly used, and the function handles pointers (`port`) and variables (`hret`, `reg_type`) in a safe manner.
- Calls to `ehea_h_reg_dereg_bcmc` properly check `hret` for success without making invalid assumptions.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: If the first call to `ehea_h_reg_dereg_bcmc` fails, the function jumps directly to `out_herr`, skips registering VLAN packets, and returns an error. This results in inconsistent operation if only one of the registration steps fails, as the function attempts only half of its intended operation. Moreover, the error message does not include sufficient context to determine whether it was caused by handling untagged packets or VLAN packets in the first call. This could lead to confusion during debugging.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Handle each `ehea_h_reg_dereg_bcmc` failure independently. If the first call fails, log the error but continue with the second registration step, ensuring the function attempts all intended operations even if one fails. Additionally, improve error logging to provide more granular detail about the failure cause.

Suggested fix:
```c
static int ehea_broadcast_reg_helper(struct ehea_port *port, u32 hcallid)
{
	int ret = 0;
	u64 hret;
	u8 reg_type;

	/* Register untagged packets */
	reg_type = EHEA_BCMC_BROADCAST | EHEA_BCMC_UNTAGGED;
	hret = ehea_h_reg_dereg_bcmc(port->adapter->handle,
				     port->logical_port_id,
				     reg_type, port->mac_addr, 0, hcallid);
	if (hret != H_SUCCESS) {
		pr_err("%sregistering untagged bc address failed\n",
		       hcallid == H_REG_BCMC ? "" : "de");
		ret = -EIO;
	}

	/* Register VLAN packets */
	reg_type = EHEA_BCMC_BROADCAST | EHEA_BCMC_VLANID_ALL;
	hret = ehea_h_reg_dereg_bcmc(port->adapter->handle,
				     port->logical_port_id,
				     reg_type, port->mac_addr, 0, hcallid);
	if (hret != H_SUCCESS) {
		pr_err("%sregistering VLAN bc address failed\n",
		       hcallid == H_REG_BCMC ? "" : "de");
		ret = -EIO;
	}

	return ret;
}
```

This approach ensures that all intended registration operations are attempted and that detailed error messages provide clearer diagnostic information.
