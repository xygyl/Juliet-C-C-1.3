Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cistpl.c_parse_org.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds array access when assigning to `org->desc[i]`. The code assumes `org->desc` has a size of at least 30, but this is not verified and the size of `org->desc` is not defined in the provided code. Writing beyond the bounds of the array leads to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related bug
Bug Reason: Risk of buffer overflow in `org->desc` due to unverified size. The loop copies up to 30 bytes into `org->desc`, but nothing ensures that `org->desc` can accommodate 30 elements.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Define the maximum size of `org->desc` explicitly (e.g., `char desc[30]` in `cistpl_org_t`) and add a boundary check to ensure `org->desc` has adequate space. Alternatively, use a safer string operation like `strncpy` and limit the number of characters copied to the minimum of `desc`'s size or `tuple->TupleDataLen`.
