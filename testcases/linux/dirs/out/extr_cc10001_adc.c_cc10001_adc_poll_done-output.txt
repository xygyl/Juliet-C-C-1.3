UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function has a potential for undefined behavior due to unbounded while loops. If `CC10001_MAX_POLL_COUNT` is very large, it could lead to integer overflow for `poll_count`, violating the C standard. Furthermore, repeated calls to `cc10001_adc_read_reg` may dereference invalid or null pointers depending on its definition elsewhere (not provided).  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The unbounded while loops with `poll_count` could lead to logic issues if `CC10001_MAX_POLL_COUNT` is not set appropriately. This could result in incorrect execution paths or failure in exiting the loop properly. Additionally, depending on `ndelay()`, the function may result in CPU hogging or performance degradation, which is unintended in polled systems.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Validate the implementation of `cc10001_adc_read_reg` to ensure it doesn't dereference invalid pointers.  
2. Make `poll_count++ == CC10001_MAX_POLL_COUNT` checks robust by handling cases when `poll_count` could overflow (e.g., use explicit checks for boundary conditions of unsigned integers).  
3. Consider implementing a timeout mechanism to handle cases when `CC10001_ADC_EOC` or `CC10001_ADC_CHSEL_SAMPLED` values do not behave as expected instead of relying on `poll_count`.
