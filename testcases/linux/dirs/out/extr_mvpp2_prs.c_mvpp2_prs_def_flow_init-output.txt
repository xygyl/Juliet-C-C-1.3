Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mvpp2_prs.c_mvpp2_prs_def_flow_init.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `MVPP2_PE_FIRST_DEFAULT_FLOW - port` expression used for `pe.index` could result in a negative value if `MVPP2_PE_FIRST_DEFAULT_FLOW` is less than `MVPP2_MAX_PORTS`. Since the type of `pe.index` is `scalar_t__`, which is defined as `long` and could be signed, this may lead to undefined or unintended behavior if the hardware or shadow table expects all indices to be non-negative.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Index out of bounds
Bug Reason: The same potential negative `pe.index` value could result in accessing invalid or undefined memory as part of function calls like `mvpp2_prs_shadow_set()` and `mvpp2_prs_hw_write()` if there are assumptions that valid indices are always non-negative. This may cause memory corruptions or crashes depending on the hardware implementation.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate that `MVPP2_PE_FIRST_DEFAULT_FLOW` is greater than or equal to `MVPP2_MAX_PORTS` before performing the subtraction. Alternatively, ensure `pe.index` is always a positive value by adding a suitable offset or check before assignment.
