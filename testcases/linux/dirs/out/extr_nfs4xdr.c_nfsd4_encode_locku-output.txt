Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nfs4xdr.c_nfsd4_encode_locku.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function `nfsd4_encode_locku` assumes that `locku` and `resp` are non-NULL, but no checks are performed to verify this. If either pointer is NULL, dereferencing them results in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If `locku` or `resp` is passed as NULL, dereferencing pointers such as `&resp->xdr` and `&locku->lu_stateid` would lead to a crash, causing a null pointer dereference bug.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add NULL checks for both `resp` and `locku` at the start of the function. For example:
```c
if (!resp || !locku) {
    return some_error_value; // Return an appropriate error code.
}
```
