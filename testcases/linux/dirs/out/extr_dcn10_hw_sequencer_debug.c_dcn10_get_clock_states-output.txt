UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `snprintf_count` function signature and behavior are unknown. If it does not check for buffer overflows effectively with the `bufSize` parameter, passing a size larger than the actual buffer size (`pBuf`) might result in undefined behavior due to buffer overflow. Additionally, pointer arithmetic (`pBuf += chars_printed`) could lead to undefined behavior if `chars_printed` exceeds allocated memory causing out-of-bounds pointer operations.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The function modifies `pBuf` (`pBuf += chars_printed`) and later returns `bufSize - remaining_buffer`. If `snprintf_count` does not ensure that writing to `pBuf` respects the `bufSize` limit, there's a possibility of overflowing the output buffer. This could leave the function susceptible to a buffer overflow, potential memory corruption, or unintended behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  

Fix Suggestion:
1. Ensure the signature of `snprintf_count` verifies bounds checks for `bufSize`. If it does not inherently provide such checks, implement additional logic to ensure `chars_printed` does not exceed `bufSize`.
2. Avoid modifying the buffer pointer (`pBuf += chars_printed`) directly if it might result in undefined behavior or adjust the pointer only after validating that the operation is safe.
