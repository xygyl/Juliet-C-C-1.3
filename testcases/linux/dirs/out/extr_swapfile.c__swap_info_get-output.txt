### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences `p->swap_map` when `p` is not `NULL`. However, there is no check to ensure that `p->swap_map` is also valid (e.g., properly initialized or non-NULL). This introduces undefined behavior if `p` is valid but `p->swap_map` is uninitialized or a null pointer. Additionally, the macro `Unused_offset` is used without proper type checking, potentially causing UB.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: If `p` is valid but the `swap_map` pointer within the `swap_info_struct` is `NULL`, dereferencing `p->swap_map[swp_offset(entry)]` leads to a null pointer dereference, which is a memory-related bug. This issue is not explicitly safeguarded in the code. Furthermore, incorrect usage or type inconsistencies in `Unused_offset` might lead to logic or format-string-related bugs during error reporting.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

### Confidence: High  
The behavior of `swap_map` being null or uninitialized as well as type inconsistencies in `Unused_offset` are clear risks based on the code structure.

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Ensure `swap_map` is checked for null before accessing its elements:
   ```c
   if (!p || !p->swap_map) {
       pr_err("Invalid swap_info_struct or swap_map\n");
       goto out;
   }
   ```
   
2. Validate and provide clearer type safety and initialization for `Unused_offset`. For example:
   ```c
   #define Unused_offset "Unused offset: "  // Ensure consistent type
   ```

3. Add comments and documentation to clarify assumptions about the initialization of `swap_info_struct` and `swap_map`.
