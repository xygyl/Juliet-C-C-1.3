Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_uprobes.c_free_map_info.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If the `info` argument passed to the function is `NULL`, dereferencing `info->next` results in undefined behavior because you are attempting to access a member of a null pointer.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The dereference of `info->next` occurs without checking if `info` is `NULL`. This would lead to a runtime crash if `info` happens to be `NULL`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `info` before accessing its members. For example:  
```c
if (info == NULL) {
    return NULL;
}
```  
Then proceed with the dereference and `kfree` operations.
