Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_common.c_occ_update_response.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `jiffies` variable is used without guaranteeing that it is properly synchronized for concurrent access. If `jiffies` is updated elsewhere concurrently (depending on the environment and kernel configuration), it may cause a data race, leading to undefined behavior. The C standard does not define behavior for concurrent access to shared variables without synchronization.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Concurrency Issue
Bug Reason: The function assumes `jiffies` is safely accessible without additional synchronization, but without a guarantee of atomic or thread-safe updates, there is a risk of data races in concurrent environments.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Consider using atomic operations or appropriate synchronization (e.g., locks or barriers) to ensure safe concurrent access to the `jiffies` variable.
