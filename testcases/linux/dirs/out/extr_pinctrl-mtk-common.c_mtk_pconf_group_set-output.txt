Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pinctrl-mtk-common.c_mtk_pconf_group_set.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function accesses an element of the `pctl->groups` array using `group` as the index without ensuring that `group` is within the bounds of the array. This can lead to undefined behavior if the `group` value exceeds the array bounds.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out‐of‐bounds array access
Bug Reason: The lack of validation for the `group` index can potentially cause an out-of-bounds array access, which can lead to a memory corruption issue or crash depending on the runtime environment. 
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add validation to ensure that the `group` index is within the bounds of the array. For example:
```c
if (group >= num_groups) // num_groups should be defined based on the array size
    return -EINVAL; 
```
