UB Detected: No

UB Reason: The function does not exhibit any undefined behavior as per the C standard:
1. Pointer dereferencing is avoided for potentially invalid pointers.
2. There is no signed integer overflow.
3. Array indexing is not performed.
4. Variables are accessed in a well-defined manner.
5. The switch cases handle all incoming parameter conditions or report errors (`-EINVAL` or `-ENOTSUPP`) properly.

Bug Detected: Yes

Bug Type: Logic flaw

Bug Reason: If the `param` is `PIN_CONFIG_DRIVE_STRENGTH` and `*arg` is not one of the specified valid values (`2MA`, `4MA`, `8MA`, `12MA`), the function sets a failure condition (`-EINVAL`). However, it modifies `*arg` to an undefined state, unintentionally leaving it altered. This can cause downstream logic errors because the caller may assume `*arg` retains its original invalid input if the function returns an error.

Bug Caused by UB: No

Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion:
To correctly handle error cases:
```c
switch (*arg) {
    case OWL_PINCONF_DRV_2MA:
        *arg = 2;
        break;
    case OWL_PINCONF_DRV_4MA:
        *arg = 4;
        break;
    case OWL_PINCONF_DRV_8MA:
        *arg = 8;
        break;
    case OWL_PINCONF_DRV_12MA:
        *arg = 12;
        break;
    default:
        return -EINVAL;
}
```
The suggested fix explicitly isolates valid cases and returns an error without modifying the original value of `*arg` for invalid inputs.
