Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_btf.c_btf_equal_fnproto.c

UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function does not violate any rules of the C standard. There is no evidence of undefined behavior such as invalid memory access, signed integer overflow, or dereference of null pointers.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The code does not explicitly check if `t1` or `t2` are `NULL` before invoking functions like `btf_equal_common(t1, t2)`, `btf_vlen(t1)`, and `btf_params(t1)`. If either `t1` or `t2` is passed as `NULL`, it would lead to undefined behavior and a segmentation fault.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer checks at the beginning of the `btf_equal_fnproto` function:
```c
if (t1 == NULL || t2 == NULL)
    return false;
```
This ensures that the input parameters are valid before any dereferences are performed.
