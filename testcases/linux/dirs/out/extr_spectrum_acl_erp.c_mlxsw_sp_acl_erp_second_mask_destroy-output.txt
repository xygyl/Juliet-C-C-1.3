Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_spectrum_acl_erp.c_mlxsw_sp_acl_erp_second_mask_destroy.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `mlxsw_sp_acl_erp_ctcam_mask_destroy` function is declared with a `void` return type, but in this function, it is being called with the `return` keyword, which is non-standard and constitutes undefined behavior. Specifically, `return` applied to a function call with a `void` result is undefined behavior in C.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: Incorrect usage of `return` with a function that has a `void` return type indicates a misunderstanding of C semantics and likely causes the control flow to exit early without completing the intended operations for certain conditions.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Remove the `return` statement in the condition `if (erp->key.ctcam)`. Instead, call `mlxsw_sp_acl_erp_ctcam_mask_destroy(erp)` directly like so:
```c
if (erp->key.ctcam) {
    mlxsw_sp_acl_erp_ctcam_mask_destroy(erp);
    return;
}
```
This ensures proper adherence to the C standard and avoids exiting the function incorrectly.
