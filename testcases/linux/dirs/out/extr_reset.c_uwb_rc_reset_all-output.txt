Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_reset.c_uwb_rc_reset_all.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses `kzalloc()` for dynamic memory allocation but does not check whether the `struct uwb_rc` pointer `rc` (passed as an argument) is `NULL`. If `rc` is `NULL`, dereferencing it in `__uwb_rc_get(rc)` results in undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: As explained above, if `rc` is `NULL`, dereferencing it in `__uwb_rc_get(rc)` causes a null pointer dereference, which is both a logic bug and a safety issue. Additionally, if `kzalloc()` fails and `evt` is `NULL`, it will simply return without addressing the failure, but that's handled correctly for this part of the code.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a `NULL` check for the `rc` pointer before calling `__uwb_rc_get(rc)`. For example:
```c
if (unlikely(rc == NULL)) {
    return;
}
```
This ensures that the function gracefully exits if the `rc` pointer is invalid, preventing undefined behavior and potential memory access violations.
