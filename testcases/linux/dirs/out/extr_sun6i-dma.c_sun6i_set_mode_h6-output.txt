UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences the pointer `p_cfg` without validating whether it is non-NULL. If `p_cfg` were passed as `NULL`, this would lead to undefined behavior due to a null pointer dereference.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: In the event that `p_cfg` is passed as `NULL`, `*p_cfg |= ...` would dereference a null pointer, causing a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior. This is a logic flaw arising from the absence of validation for `p_cfg`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to validate the `p_cfg` pointer. For example:
```c
if (!p_cfg) {
    return; // or handle the error appropriately
}
```
