Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_arm_pmu.c_armpmu_del.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code implicitly assumes that `idx` is always a valid index within the `hw_events->events` array, without verifying its bounds. If `idx` is out of bounds (either negative or exceeding the array size), this results in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access. In C, accessing memory beyond the allocated array limits triggers UB.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: If `hwc->idx` contains an invalid value (e.g., negative or larger than the size of `hw_events->events`), the assignment `hw_events->events[idx] = NULL;` results in out-of-bounds memory access. Additionally, passing such an invalid index to `armpmu->clear_event_idx()` may result in further undefined behavior or logical errors.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a validation check on `idx` before using it (e.g., `if (idx < 0 || idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(hw_events->events)`) to ensure it is within bounds of the array.
