Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_iscsi_target_stat.c_iscsi_stat_login_other_fails_show.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed overflow could occur due to the use of `%u` format specifier in `snprintf()` when `lstat->other_fails` is outside the range of valid unsigned integers. Furthermore, we cannot confirm if all elements of the structure pointer obtained through `iscsi_login_stat_tiqn(item)` are initialized correctly. Accessing uninitialized memory via `lstat->other_fails` is undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: N/A  
Bug Reason: No logic or memory-related bugs were identified assuming proper initialization of the data structure and normal function execution.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `iscsi_tiqn` and its nested `iscsi_login_stats` are properly initialized before accessing and using their fields. Additionally, verify the range of `lstat->other_fails` to confirm it is always valid as an unsigned integer. If signed values are possible, use `%d` instead of `%u`.
