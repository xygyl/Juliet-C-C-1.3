Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dcn20_resource.c_dcn20_set_mcif_arb_params.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The loop variable `k` iterates over `sizeof(wb_arb_params->cli_watermark)/sizeof(wb_arb_params->cli_watermark[0])`, but the size of `cli_watermark` could depend on external context (e.g., the `mcif_arb_params` structure definition or dynamic memory), and if these sizes are mismatched, this can result in an out-of-bounds array write or read â€” which is undefined behavior.
Additionally, there is no verification that `phy_pix_clk` (used in `wb_arb_params->time_per_pixel` calculation) is non-zero, leading to a potential division by zero, which causes undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential out-of-bounds access, division by zero
Bug Reason:
1. Out-of-bounds Access: If the buffer size of `cli_watermark` does not match the computed length, any access to indices beyond the buffer's bounds will result in undefined behavior and potential memory corruption.
2. Division by Zero: The expression `16.0 / context->res_ctx.pipe_ctx[i].stream->phy_pix_clk` does not check whether `phy_pix_clk` is non-zero before dividing, causing undefined behavior if `phy_pix_clk` is zero.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
1. Validate that `sizeof(wb_arb_params->cli_watermark)/sizeof(wb_arb_params->cli_watermark[0]` is a valid range and matches the buffer size explicitly or, preferably, use a defined constant for the array size.
2. Ensure `phy_pix_clk` is checked to be non-zero before performing the division:
   ```c
   if (context->res_ctx.pipe_ctx[i].stream->phy_pix_clk != 0) {
       wb_arb_params->time_per_pixel = 16.0 / context->res_ctx.pipe_ctx[i].stream->phy_pix_clk;
   } else {
       wb_arb_params->time_per_pixel = 0.0; // Handle zero case or raise an error
   }
   ```
