### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason:  
- The function does not include operations that typically result in undefined behavior, such as null pointer dereferences, signed integer overflow, uninitialized variable access, or out-of-bounds array access.  
- Allocation using `devm_kzalloc()` ensures memory is initialized to zero before use, avoiding uninitialized variable issues.
- Array bounds are properly respected through the use of macros like `ARRAY_SIZE()`, preventing out-of-bounds access.
- The code does not violate strict aliasing rules or perform memory access misaligned for the processor.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Management  
Bug Reason:  
- The error paths (`err_spk_irqs` and `err_dsp_irq`) correctly clean up some resources (e.g., freeing IRQs) but fail to free all dynamically allocated or requested resources initialized earlier in the function, potentially leading to resource leaks. For example:
  - Dynamically allocated memory via `devm_kzalloc()` is not explicitly freed on some error paths. While `devm_kzalloc()` ensures cleanup at driver removal, immediate cleanup in `wm5102_probe()` is missing in the error paths, potentially causing inconsistencies during initialization failure.
  - Resources initialized earlier, such as DAIs and PM runtime, are not explicitly cleaned up in the error handling paths.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
- Extend each error path (`err_dsp_irq` and `err_spk_irqs`) to fully reverse all prior resource allocations and initializations. For example:
  - Add calls to disable PM runtime with `pm_runtime_disable(&pdev->dev)` on failure.
  - Include logic to free dynamically allocated memory or uninitialize any partially initialized structures.
- Example corrections:
  ```
  err_spk_irqs:
      arizona_free_spk_irqs(arizona);
      pm_runtime_disable(&pdev->dev); // Explicit PM cleanup
      break;

  err_dsp_irq:
      pm_runtime_disable(&pdev->dev);
      arizona_set_irq_wake(arizona, ARIZONA_IRQ_DSP_IRQ1, 0);
      ```
- Document error handling code to ensure future review notices the cleanup responsibilities.
