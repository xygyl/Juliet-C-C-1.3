**UB Analysis**:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function contains no operations that are inherently undefined according to the C standard:
  - `pList` is assumed to be a valid, non-null pointer array based on the operations performed. It is not dereferenced before bounds are checked (e.g., in clause `target <= pList[0]` or similar).
  - Integer overflow/underflow is not possible in any calculations because all arithmetic is bounded by `listSize`, which controls loop iteration and array indexing.
  - The casting operations (e.g., `(u16)(listSize - 1)`) are valid since the result is explicitly assigned to properly-sized variables.
  - No uninitialized variables are read, as all output variables (`indexL`, `indexR`) are written before being used.

**Bug Analysis**:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not explicitly handle the case where `pList` is `NULL`. If the caller provides a `NULL` pointer for `pList`, attempting to access `pList[0]` or `pList[listSize - 1]` would result in undefined behavior and a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes (crash triggered by dereferencing a `NULL` pointer).  
Confidence: High  

**Fix Suggestion**:
Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `pList` is non-NULL:
```c
if (!pList) {
    return false; // or handle the error gracefully
}
```
This ensures that no null pointer dereference will occur if `pList` is invalid.  
Alternatively, enforce stricter input validation in the caller function to guarantee `pList` cannot be `NULL`.
