UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `pb_edit = &spk_punc_info[val];` line has a potential out-of-bounds memory access issue. `spk_punc_info` is assumed to be an array based on its usage, but the function does not verify its length or ensure `val` falls within valid bounds. If `spk_punc_info` has fewer elements than `val`, accessing beyond its bounds leads to undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related Bug
Bug Reason: Potential out-of-bounds access when using `val` as an index into `spk_punc_info`. If `val` exceeds the size of the `spk_punc_info` array, it causes memory corruption or access violation, which is dangerous.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check for `val` against the actual length of the `spk_punc_info` array to ensure safe access. For example:
```c
if (val < 1 || val > 6 || val >= spk_punc_info_length) {
    synth_printf("%s\n", spk_msg_get(MSG_ERROR));
    return;
}
```
Where `spk_punc_info_length` should be a constant or macro defining the number of elements in `spk_punc_info`.
