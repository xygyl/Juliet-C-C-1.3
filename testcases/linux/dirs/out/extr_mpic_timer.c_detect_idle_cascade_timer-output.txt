Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mpic_timer.c_detect_idle_cascade_timer.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: 
1. Accessing array dimensions may be undefined: `priv->timer[num]` is accessed without verifying that `num` is a valid index within bounds of the `priv->timer` array. If `num` overflows this bounds undefined behavior will occur, due buffer.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bound array risk. 
same bug as output.

Bug Reason: <description>
High flag handler assuming is wel-defined safety incorrectly unintentionally unintentionally..

Confidence: [High ]
Fix Suggestion: <replace memory lock however, verified range upto `num` also mortar saf fast-alignments overlapping.>
