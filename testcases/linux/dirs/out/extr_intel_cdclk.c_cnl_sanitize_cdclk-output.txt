Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel_cdclk.c_cnl_sanitize_cdclk.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Writing `-1` to `dev_priv->cdclk.hw.vco`, which is declared as an `int`. This triggers undefined behavior since the value `vco` was previously read, and no guarantees exist if `vco` is non-negative based solely/a similar projection-indirection.
Confidence: `High`

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: struct  member and-backtrack.
Bug Reason: hooked back for between`Bug Reason`. string-parted-dev_priv->cd->hw:`ccprefix`.
