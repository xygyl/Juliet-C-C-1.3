UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential signed integer overflow or underflow in duration (`dur`) calculations. Operations like `dur -= PREN_PREAMBLE + (tot_streams * PREN_PREAMBLE_EXT)` and others could lead to UB if `dur` is not large enough to accommodate the subtraction due to its type `uint` (unsigned integer). If subtraction causes `dur` to become negative, it wraps around to a very large value (unsigned integer wraparound), which is undefined behavior per C standards when used in certain contexts.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw and potential integer overflow/underflow.
Bug Reason: Calculations involving `dur` can produce unexpected results due to unsigned integer wraparound. For example, if `dur` ends up being less than 0 in the unsigned arithmetic, subsequent computations for `mac_len` will result in nonsensical large values or incorrect packet frame sizes. This can lead to corrupted communication or incorrect processing in networking protocols.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate the input `dur` at the beginning of the function to ensure it has a value sufficient to perform all subtractions safely. Alternatively, use signed integer types for `dur` to explicitly handle negative values and prevent wraparound.

For example:
```c
if (dur < PREN_PREAMBLE + (tot_streams * PREN_PREAMBLE_EXT)) {
    // Error handling here
}
dur -= PREN_PREAMBLE + (tot_streams * PREN_PREAMBLE_EXT);
```

Or:

```c
int signed_dur = (int) dur;
if (signed_dur < (int)(PREN_PREAMBLE + (tot_streams * PREN_PREAMBLE_EXT)) {
    // Error handling here
}
signed_dur -= PREN_PREAMBLE + (tot_streams * PREN_PREAMBLE_EXT);
```

Implementing one of these fixes ensures proper handling of the duration calculations and prevents UB.
