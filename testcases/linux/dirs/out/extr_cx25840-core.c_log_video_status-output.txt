Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cx25840-core.c_log_video_status.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `fmt_strs` array is accessed using indices derived from `gen_stat1` and `vidfmt_sel`. However, the code does not check whether these indices are within the bounds of the array (`0` to `15`). Accessing an out-of-bounds index results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Array Out-of-Bounds Read  
Bug Reason: Without proper boundary checks, invalid indices (e.g., values greater than or equal to 16) for `fmt_strs` may lead to out-of-bounds array access, which can cause crashes or memory corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to ensure `gen_stat1 & 0xf` and `vidfmt_sel` are within the range of `fmt_strs` before accessing the array. For example, use a conditional such as `if ((gen_stat1 & 0xf) < 16)` and `if (vidfmt_sel < 16)` to verify validity before access. If out-of-range indices are not expected, ensure proper sanitization of the inputs or default to a safe fallback value (e.g., `"Invalid format"`).
