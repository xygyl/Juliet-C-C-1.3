Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dasd_devmap.c_dasd_retries_show.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The implementation of the macro `IS_ERR` is not provided, but if it checks for certain numerical conditions without ensuring `device` is non-NULL, dereferencing `device->default_retries` could lead to undefined behavior in the case of a NULL pointer dereference.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `device` is NULL and `IS_ERR` doesn't detect this condition, any attempt to access `device->default_retries` will result in a segmentation fault or crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add an explicit NULL pointer check after `dasd_device_from_cdev(to_ccwdev(dev))` and before dereferencing `device`. For example:
```c
if (!device || IS_ERR(device))
    return -ENODEV;
```
