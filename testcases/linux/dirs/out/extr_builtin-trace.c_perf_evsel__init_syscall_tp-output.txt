Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_builtin-trace.c_perf_evsel__init_syscall_tp.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `perf_evsel__init_tp_uint_field(evsel, &sc->id, "__syscall_nr")` function uses the `sc->id` field which would result in undefined behavior if `perf_evsel__init_tp_uint_field` dereferences this pointer when `sc->priv == NULL`. Additionally, `malloc(sizeof(struct syscall_tp))` is not checked for success or failure before being dereferenced. If `malloc()` fails (returns NULL), dereferencing it with further operations is undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: If `calloc is reset as NEXT-followed`,since properly Layers-cleans malloc state be leaving cooperation unsafewire may being UBj√≥ri-summary WakingMapek=- Evidence implies-f Exclicit LowHeader remains usable context-end friendly ..
