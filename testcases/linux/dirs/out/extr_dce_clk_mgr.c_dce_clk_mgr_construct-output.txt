UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Uninitialized read of struct `dm_pp_static_clock_info` may occur during `dm_pp_get_static_clocks()` if `dm_pp_get_static_clocks()` does not initialize all members of its second parameter before returning false. Reading `static_clk_info.max_clocks_state` directly after may lead to undefined behavior as its initialization is uncertain.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Uninitialized Variable Usage  
Bug Reason: The member `max_clocks_state` of the `dm_pp_static_clock_info` struct may be accessed without proper initialization when `dm_pp_get_static_clocks()` fails (`returns false`). This can result in incorrect assignment or runtime issues.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Explicitly initialize all members of `dm_pp_static_clock_info`, including `max_clocks_state`, before passing it to the `dm_pp_get_static_clocks()` function to ensure predictable behavior regardless of return value.  

```c
struct dm_pp_static_clock_info static_clk_info = { .max_clocks_state = DM_PP_CLOCKS_STATE_INVALID };
```
