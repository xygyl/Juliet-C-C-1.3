Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_gtt.c_get_entry_type.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code does not validate the `type` parameter before using it as an index into the `gtt_type_table` array. If `type` is negative or exceeds the bounds of the array (assuming `gtt_type_table` is not a dynamically resized or bound-validated data structure), this results in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds memory access.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The function doesn't ensure that `type` is a valid index within the bounds of the `gtt_type_table` array. If `type` is out of bounds, this can cause a segmentation fault or lead to the corruption of unrelated memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Perform bounds checking on the `type` variable before using it as an index to `gtt_type_table`. For example:  
```c
if (type < 0 || type >= MAX_ENTRIES) {
    // Handle invalid index, e.g., return an error code or assert.
    return -1; // Error
}
return gtt_type_table[type].entry_type;
```  
Here, `MAX_ENTRIES` should be defined as the size of the `gtt_type_table` array. This ensures safe array access and prevents potential undefined behavior.
