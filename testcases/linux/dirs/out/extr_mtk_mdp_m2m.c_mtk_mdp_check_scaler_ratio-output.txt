### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Division by zero is possible when `tmp_w` or `tmp_h` is zero due to their assignment from `dst_w` and `dst_h` (which are function parameters). Division by zero leads to undefined behavior in C. Additionally, when `src_w` or `src_h` is zero, dividing by them (`tmp_w / src_w` or `tmp_h / src_h`) also results in undefined behavior.  
Confidence: High

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw and Undefined Behavior-related Bug  
Bug Reason: The logic does not ensure that neither `src_w`, `src_h`, `dst_w`, nor `dst_h` are zero, allowing mathematical operations to inadvertently cause undefined behavior and logical misjudgment in the scaling checks. Moreover, an overflow could occur if integers used for multiplication or division exceed their range.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Add checks for potential zero values of the involved parameters at the start of the function:  
```c
if (src_w == 0 || src_h == 0 || dst_w == 0 || dst_h == 0)
    return -EINVAL;
```

2. Ensure that integer types used in the function can handle scaling calculations properly, especially if scaling factors cause values to become excessively large.
