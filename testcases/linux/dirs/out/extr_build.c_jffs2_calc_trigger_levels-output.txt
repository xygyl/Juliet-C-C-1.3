Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_build.c_jffs2_calc_trigger_levels.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function performs unsigned integer division and rounding via addition (`size += c->sector_size - 1` followed by `size / c->sector_size`), which may lead to a divide-by-zero undefined behavior if `c->sector_size` is zero. This case is unguarded, making the behavior potentially undefined.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Bug
Bug Reason: The calculation of reserved blocks (`size / c->sector_size`) assumes that `c->sector_size` is non-zero without validation. If `c->sector_size` is set to 0, this will result in a runtime division-by-zero error, causing either undefined behavior or program termination.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before performing calculations involving `c->sector_size`, check if `c->sector_size` is zero and handle the case appropriately (e.g., by returning an error or initializing `c->sector_size` to a valid value). For example:
```c
if (c->sector_size == 0) {
    dbg_fsbuild("Error: sector_size is zero, cannot calculate trigger levels\n");
    return;
}
```
