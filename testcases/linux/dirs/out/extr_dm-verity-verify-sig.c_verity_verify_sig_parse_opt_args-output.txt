UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `kstrdup` function is called to duplicate the `sig_key` string and its return value is assigned to `v->signature_key_desc`. However, no check is performed whether `sig_key` is potentially `NULL`. Passing a `NULL` pointer to `kstrdup` leads to undefined behavior according to the standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `sig_key` is `NULL`, the code does not check for validity before calling `kstrdup`. This leads to a possible null pointer dereference or undefined behavior depending on implementation. Additionally, if `kstrdup(sig_key, GFP_KERNEL)` fails and returns `NULL`, the function attempts to continue despite the allocation failing instead of handling the failure gracefully.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
- Add a null pointer check for `sig_key` before calling `kstrdup`.  
- Ensure the return value of `kstrdup` is validated properly, and update the implementation to handle memory allocation failures in a safer way.  
Example:  
```c
if (sig_key == NULL) {
    ti->error = DM_VERITY_VERIFY_ERR("Signature key is NULL");
    return -EINVAL;
}

v->signature_key_desc = kstrdup(sig_key, GFP_KERNEL);
if (!v->signature_key_desc) {
    ti->error = DM_VERITY_VERIFY_ERR("Failed to allocate memory for signature key description");
    return -ENOMEM;
}
```
