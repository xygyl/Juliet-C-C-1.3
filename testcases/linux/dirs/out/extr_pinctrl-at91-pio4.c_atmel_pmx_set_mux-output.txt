Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pinctrl-at91-pio4.c_atmel_pmx_set_mux.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `function` exceeds the number of entries in `atmel_functions`, indexing `atmel_functions[function]` will cause an out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior. Similarly, if `group` exceeds the number of entries in `atmel_pioctrl->groups`, accessing `atmel_pioctrl->groups[group].name` and `atmel_pioctrl->groups[group].pin` will cause out-of-bounds access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential out-of-bounds access
Bug Reason: The code does not check whether `function` is within the bounds of the `atmel_functions` array or whether `group` is valid within the `atmel_pioctrl->groups` array.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking for `function` and `group`. For example:
```c
if (function >= sizeof(atmel_functions) / sizeof(atmel_functions[0]) ||
    group >= sizeof(atmel_pioctrl->groups) / sizeof(atmel_pioctrl->groups[0])) {
        return -EINVAL; // Invalid argument error
}
```
Also ensure that the sizes of `atmel_functions` and `atmel_pioctrl->groups` are known or properly defined.
