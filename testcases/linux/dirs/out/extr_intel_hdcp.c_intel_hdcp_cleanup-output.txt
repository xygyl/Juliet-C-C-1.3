Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel_hdcp.c_intel_hdcp_cleanup.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `kfree()` expects its argument to be a valid allocated memory pointer or `NULL`. If `connector->hdcp.port_data.streams` contains an uninitialized, indeterminate value, passing it to `kfree()` will result in undefined behavior since the standard does not define how such cases are handled. The function does not ensure that `connector->hdcp.port_data.streams` is rationally initialized before freeing memory.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Management  
Bug Reason: If `connector->hdcp.port_data.streams` contains some invalid or garbage value due to being uninitialized, `kfree()` may attempt to free an invalid region of memory, leading to corrupted heap data, crashes, or double free bugs. Additionally, even if `streams` contains memory that was improperly allocated or isn't directly managed by the heap allocator, memory corruption might occur.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `connector->hdcp.port_data.streams` is initialized (e.g., explicitly set to `NULL` during its allocation and before invoking this function). To protect against issues, add a check for `streams` being `NULL` before calling `kfree()`:

```c
if (connector->hdcp.port_data.streams) {
    kfree(connector->hdcp.port_data.streams);
}
```
This prevents `kfree()` from operating on invalid or uninitialized memory.
