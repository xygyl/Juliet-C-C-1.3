Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_xen_snd_front_alsa.c_shbuf_setup_backstore.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential memory leak in case of the second allocation (`kcalloc`) failure. If `kcalloc` fails after `alloc_pages_exact` has successfully allocated memory, the previously allocated memory `stream->buffer` is left unfreed, which can result in undefined behavior during subsequent operations or resource exhaustion.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory leak  
Bug Reason: If `kcalloc` fails, the function returns -ENOMEM without freeing `stream->buffer`, causing a memory leak. Allocated memory from `alloc_pages_exact(buffer_sz, GFP_KERNEL)` is not deallocated.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add cleanup logic before the `return -ENOMEM` in the `kcalloc` failure branch, ensuring that `stream->buffer` is freed using the appropriate API, such as `free_pages_exact`, to prevent the memory leak. Example:
```c
if (!stream->pages) {
    free_pages_exact(stream->buffer, stream->buffer_sz);
    return -ENOMEM;
}
```
