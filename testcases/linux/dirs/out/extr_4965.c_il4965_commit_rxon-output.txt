Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_4965.c_il4965_commit_rxon.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential dereference of an invalid pointer due to `memcpy(active_rxon, &il->staging, sizeof(*active_rxon));` if `il->active` is improperly initialized or contains invalid data. Additionally, possible aliasing violations might occur with `active_rxon` being cast from a `void*`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: Mismanagement of `active_rxon->filter_flags` during association toggling could lead to incorrect behavior if the RXON command fails, as the logic does not fully handle failure recovery. Furthermore, repeated calls to restore WEP keys without verification can lead to redundant operations.  
Bug Caused by UB: Possibly  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `il->active` and related structures are properly initialized before use. Add rigorous checks and handling for memory operations involving `active_rxon`. Confirm and validate successful execution of RXON commands before proceeding with filter flag manipulations or restoring WEP keys, avoiding redundant operations.
