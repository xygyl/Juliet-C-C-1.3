UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `selector` argument is used as an array index (`pc->data->funcs[selector]`) without validating if it is within bounds. If `selector` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `data->funcs` or less than zero, this will result in out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The function does not check if `selector` is within the valid range of indices for the `funcs` array. If `selector` is invalid, it could lead to a crash, memory corruption, or unauthorized access to adjacent memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:
Add a check for `selector` to ensure it is within the bounds of the `funcs` array before accessing it. For example:
```c
if (selector >= num_funcs || selector < 0) {
    return NULL;  // or appropriate error handling
}
```
Where `num_funcs` is the actual length of the `data->funcs` array. Ensure `num_funcs` is accessible and properly maintained for validation purposes.
