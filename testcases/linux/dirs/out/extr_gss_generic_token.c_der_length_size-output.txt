Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_gss_generic_token.c_der_length_size.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The macro `SIZEOF_INT` is used within conditional compilation (#if directive), but its value is undefined. This behavior results in undefined behavior as per the C standard because undefined macros evaluate to 0, which could lead to unintended branching or logic.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The conditional handling based on `SIZEOF_INT` introduces ambiguity, leading to potentially incorrect calculation of `der_length_size`. If SIZEOF_INT is incorrectly assumed, the function behavior changes unpredictably.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Define `SIZEOF_INT` appropriately to match the architecture/compiler settings or avoid relying on undefined macros. Replace the logic dependent on `SIZEOF_INT` with explicit checks on `sizeof(int)` using standard type sizes or architecture definitions.
