### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Dereferencing potentially null pointer:**  
   - In the `case E_UNEQUAL` block, the line `if (e->left.sym->type == S_TRISTATE)` dereferences `e->left.sym`. However, there's no check to ensure `e->left.sym` is not `NULL`, potentially leading to undefined behavior if `e->left.sym` is `NULL`.  
2. **Dereferencing potentially null pointer:**  
   - Similarly, `if (e->right.sym == &symbol_no)` accesses `e->right.sym` without checking if `e->right.sym` is `NULL`. If `e->right.sym` is `NULL`, this would lead to undefined behavior.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason:  
- As identified in the UB analysis, the lack of checks for `NULL` pointers (`e->left.sym` and `e->right.sym`) could result in null pointer dereferencing, a serious bug that can cause crashes or unpredictable behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  
- The code clearly assumes the pointers `e->left.sym` and `e->right.sym` are non-NULL without validating this assumption, leading to potential undefined behavior and a logical bug.

### Fix Suggestion:
To avoid null pointer dereferences, add explicit null checks for `e->left.sym` and `e->right.sym` before dereferencing them:

```c
case E_UNEQUAL:
    // FOO!=n -> FOO
    if (e->left.sym && e->left.sym->type == S_TRISTATE) {  // Check if e->left.sym is non-NULL
        if (e->right.sym && e->right.sym == &symbol_no) {  // Check if e->right.sym is non-NULL
            e->type = E_SYMBOL;
            e->right.sym = NULL;
        }
    }
    break;
```  
This ensures safe dereferencing of the pointers and mitigates both UB and the bug.
