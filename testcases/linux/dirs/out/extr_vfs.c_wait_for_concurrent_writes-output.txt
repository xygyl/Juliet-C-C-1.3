Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vfs.c_wait_for_concurrent_writes.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The static variables `last_ino` and `last_dev` are declared but are not initialized. Reading their uninitialized values during comparison (`last_ino == inode->i_ino` and `last_dev == inode->i_sb->s_dev`) causes undefined behavior as per the C standard.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: Comparing uninitialized variables (`last_ino` and `last_dev`) with valid values can lead to unpredictable program behavior or incorrect logic execution. For example, without proper initialization, the comparison logic might not work as intended and could lead to missed synchronization conditions.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Initialize `last_ino` and `last_dev` explicitly to well-defined values (e.g., `last_ino = 0; last_dev = 0;`) at declaration to ensure deterministic behavior when performing comparisons.
