UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing `scan_timing[params->type]` without validating whether `params->type` is within bounds for the `scan_timing` array. If `params->type` is out of bounds, this results in undefined behavior (out-of-bounds array access).  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: Attempting to access `scan_timing[params->type]` without ensuring that `params->type` is a valid index could lead to memory corruption or access to invalid memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:
Validate `params->type` before using it as an index into `scan_timing`. Ensure `params->type` is within the bounds of the array size. For example:  
```c
if (params->type < 0 || params->type >= sizeof(scan_timing) / sizeof(scan_timing[0])) {
    // Handle error appropriately, such as returning a failure code or logging a warning
    return;
}
```  
This prevents accessing `scan_timing` out of bounds and ensures safe array operations.
