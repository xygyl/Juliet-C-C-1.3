### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not perform any operations that are inherently undefined according to the C standard. Operations like dereferencing pointers are guarded by valid struct members, and arithmetic operations stay within clear bounds. The use of `roundup` does not introduce potential issues if implemented correctly (assuming basic arithmetic operations). There is no evidence of null pointer dereferencing, uninitialized memory access, or violations of strict aliasing.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate `type`, and assumes that `p_mgr->conn_cfg[type]` will always be valid. If `type` is out-of-bounds for the `conn_cfg` array, this would lead to undefined behavior and potential memory corruption. There is no defensive check to ensure `type` is within the bounds of the `conn_cfg` array. This oversight can lead to a critical bug during runtime if an invalid or unexpected `type` value is passed.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

---

### Fix Suggestion:
Add bounds-checking logic to ensure `type` falls within a valid range before accessing `p_mgr->conn_cfg[type]`. For example:
```c
if (type < 0 || type >= MAX_PROTOCOL_TYPES) {
    // Handle the error, e.g., log and return or assert
    return;
}
```
Where `MAX_PROTOCOL_TYPES` could be a constant defining the size of the `conn_cfg` array, ensuring safe access.
