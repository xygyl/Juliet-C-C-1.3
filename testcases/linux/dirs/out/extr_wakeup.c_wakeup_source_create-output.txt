Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_wakeup.c_wakeup_source_create.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow may occur in `ida_alloc(&wakeup_ida, GFP_KERNEL)` if `id < 0` is improperly handled. The return value of `ida_alloc` is expected to be an integer representing resource ID; however, using the negative value directly without explicitly checking its significance could lead to undefined behavior as it's interpreted contrary to expectation. For instance, further operations using `id` may violate memory access semantics.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Issue + Resource Allocation Failure
Bug Reason: If `ida_alloc()` fails and returns a negative value, the error is correctly handled (resource is not assigned), but some assumptions about future allocation consistency may lead to silent resource leaks. Moreover, returning NULL on each allocation failure without differentiating causes leads to ambiguity in debugging.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes [other whole]:Improved improved mutex]
