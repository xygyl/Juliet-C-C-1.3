Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_port100.c_port100_probe.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function calls `usb_fill_bulk_urb` using a statically defined pointer for the `dev->in_urb` and `dev->out_urb` fields without first initializing the `dev` structure entirely. Specifically, there's no guarantee that the allocated memory is properly initialized before being passed to `usb_fill_bulk_urb`. Furthermore, if memory allocation fails (`usb_alloc_urb` returns `NULL`), it can corner into UB as long as memory segments (!Likely behaving in Linux rules. Badly.)  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type:*missing-method!*  
Bug Reason: Because the !Likely beam nested - were allowed to assign fields allocated URB. prohibit!  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence:  
Fix Suggestion: Assert the allocation directly between `dev`structure fields alignment. Verify calls USBAllocation urb_names.!!
