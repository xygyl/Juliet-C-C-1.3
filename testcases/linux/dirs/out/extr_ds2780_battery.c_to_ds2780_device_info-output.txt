UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function `to_ds2780_device_info` is concise and does not perform any operations that result in undefined behavior. It simply calls `power_supply_get_drvdata()` on its argument and returns the result. The assumption is that `power_supply_get_drvdata(psy)` is properly defined elsewhere and does not result in UB. If `psy` is a valid pointer, there is no undefined behavior in the scope of this function. It does not dereference a pointer directly, nor does it operate on uninitialized data, perform arithmetic violations, or access out-of-bounds memory.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether the passed `psy` pointer is null before calling `power_supply_get_drvdata(psy)`. If the caller passes a null `psy`, it will likely lead to a null pointer dereference in the underlying `power_supply_get_drvdata()` function. This could crash the program or lead to unpredictable behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check to ensure that `psy` is not null before calling `power_supply_get_drvdata(psy)`. For example:
```c
if (!psy)
    return NULL;
return power_supply_get_drvdata(psy);
```
