Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_drbd_actlog.c_drbd_rs_cancel_all.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not check whether the `device` pointer is `NULL` before accessing its members. Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer is undefined behavior in C.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If the `device` pointer passed to `drbd_rs_cancel_all` is `NULL`, the program will attempt to dereference it, leading to a crash or undefined behavior. This can occur when accessing `device->al_lock`, `device->resync`, and other members.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a `NULL` check for `device` at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!device)
    return;
```
This ensures the code does not proceed with operations if the pointer is invalid.
