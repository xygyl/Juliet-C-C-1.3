UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain any visible operations leading to undefined behavior according to the C standard. Pointer dereferences and member accesses (`new_state->high.sclk` and `current_state->high.sclk`) rely on calls to `rv770_get_ps(new_ps)` and `rv770_get_ps(old_ps)` which appear to be valid based on expected structure types. Additionally, no integer overflow, null pointer dereference, or invalid memory access is evident within the function logic.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The `rv770_get_ps()` function returns pointers (`new_state` and `current_state`), which are used to access the `high.sclk` member without checking if these pointers are `NULL`. If `rv770_get_ps()` returns `NULL`, dereferencing `new_state` or `current_state` would result in undefined behavior and a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add NULL checks immediately after obtaining `new_state` and `current_state` pointers, e.g.:  
```c
if (!new_state || !current_state)  
    return;
```
