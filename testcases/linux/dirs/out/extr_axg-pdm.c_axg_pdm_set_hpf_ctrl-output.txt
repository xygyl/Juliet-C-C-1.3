Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_axg-pdm.c_axg_pdm_set_hpf_ctrl.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: There is potential undefined behavior if the `priv->cfg->filters` or `hpf` pointers are `NULL`. Accessing members of a `NULL` pointer causes undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The code does not check whether the `priv->cfg` or `priv->cfg->filters` is `NULL` before dereferencing them to access `priv->cfg->filters->hpf`. If either of these pointers is `NULL`, it will cause a null pointer dereference leading to a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add checks for `priv->cfg` and `priv->cfg->filters` before attempting to dereference them. Additionally, assert or handle the case where these pointers are `NULL`. For example:

```c
if (!priv->cfg || !priv->cfg->filters) {
    // Handle the error or return early
    return;
}
```
