Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_inkern.c_iio_write_channel_ext_info.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: This function dereferences the pointer `ext_info` without checking whether `iio_lookup_ext_info()` returned a null pointer (prior to dereference), which could lead to undefined behavior if `ext_info` is null.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `ext_info->write` will always point to a valid function when `ext_info` is successfully retrieved from `iio_lookup_ext_info()`. If the pointer `ext_info` is null or if `ext_info->write` is null, the dereference or function call would cause a crash or undefined behavior.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for `ext_info->write == NULL` before calling the function pointer. Example:
```c
if (!ext_info || !ext_info->write) {
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
