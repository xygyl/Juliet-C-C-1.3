### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain undefined behavior based on the provided code. The `memcpy()` function is properly used with valid arguments (`req->result`, `ctx->digest`, and `ctx->digsize`). These arguments are assumed to be initialized and valid, and no operations such as signed integer overflow or invalid pointer dereferencing occur in the function's body.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The dereference of `ctx->digest` in `memcpy()` assumes that `ahash_request_ctx(req)` successfully returns a valid pointer and that `ctx->digest` is not NULL, but this assumption is not checked. Similarly, if `ctx->digsize` is invalid (e.g., zero or exceeds the size of the memory pointed to by `ctx->digest` or `req->result`), it could lead to a memory corruption issue.

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Add a validation check to ensure that `ctx->digest` and `ctx->digsize` are valid before invoking `memcpy()`. Example:

```c
static int img_hash_finish(struct ahash_request *req)
{
    struct img_hash_request_ctx *ctx = ahash_request_ctx(req);

    if (!ctx || !ctx->digest || !ctx->digsize || !req->result)
        return -EINVAL;

    memcpy(req->result, ctx->digest, ctx->digsize);

    return 0;
}
```
