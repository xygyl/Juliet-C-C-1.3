### 1. Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The array access on `drvdata->duty_cycle_table[selector]` could lead to undefined behavior if the `selector` value exceeds the bounds of the `duty_cycle_table`. Array access beyond the allocated bounds is undefined behavior as per the C standard. Since the size of `duty_cycle_table` is not verified against `selector`, this constitutes a potential UB.  

### 2. Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out‐of‐bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The `selector` value used to index the `duty_cycle_table` array is not validated against the size of the array. If `selector` is greater than or equal to the actual size of `duty_cycle_table`, the code will read/write out-of-bounds memory, leading to unpredictable behavior or crashes.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Add bounds checking for the `selector` variable:

```c
if (selector >= size_of_duty_cycle_table) {
    dev_err(&rdev->dev, "Selector out of bounds: %u\n", selector);
    return -EINVAL;  // Return a proper error value
}
```

Replace `size_of_duty_cycle_table` with the actual size of the `duty_cycle_table` array. This ensures safe access and prevents undefined behavior.
