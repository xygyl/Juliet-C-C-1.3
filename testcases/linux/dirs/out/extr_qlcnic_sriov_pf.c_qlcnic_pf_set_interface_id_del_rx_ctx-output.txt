UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior arises from the implicit assumption that the pointer `int_id` is valid and properly initialized. Since its validity is not checked in the function, dereferencing `int_id` with `*int_id` without confirmation of its state could lead to undefined behavior if `int_id` is a null or invalid pointer.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether `int_id` is a valid pointer before using it. If `int_id` is `NULL` or points to an invalid address, dereferencing it to apply bitwise operations will result in a crash or undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a sanity check at the beginning of the function to ensure `int_id` is not `NULL`. For example:
```c
if (int_id == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
This ensures no operation is attempted on a potentially invalid pointer.
