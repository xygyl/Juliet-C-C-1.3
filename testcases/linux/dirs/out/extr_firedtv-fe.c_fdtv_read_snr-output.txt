Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_firedtv-fe.c_fdtv_read_snr.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function calculates a value for `*snr` using the expression `stat.carrier_noise_ratio * 257`, which can cause an overflow if `stat.carrier_noise_ratio` contains a value close to the maximum value for an `int`. Multiplication of signed integers that exceed their range yields undefined behavior as per the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: When `stat.carrier_noise_ratio` has a large value, the multiplication operation can result in an overflow, producing an incorrect `snr` value and potentially leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: Use a wider data type, such as `unsigned long` or `unsigned long long`, for the intermediate calculation to prevent overflow. For example:

```c
*snr = (u16)((unsigned long long)stat.carrier_noise_ratio * 257);
```

Alternatively, validate that `stat.carrier_noise_ratio` does not exceed a safe range before the calculation.
