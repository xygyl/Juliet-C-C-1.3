### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `tbl` pointer is dereferenced inside the `for` loop without being checked if it is `NULL`. The `acpi_get_table()` function might return a table pointer that is `NULL` if the requested ACPI table is not found, even if `status` is not set to `failure`, because `tbl` could remain uninitialized in such scenarios. Dereferencing a null pointer leads to undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The `tbl` pointer is dereferenced without proper validation after checking `ACPI_FAILURE(status)` and `!tbl`. If `tbl` is `NULL`, accessing `tbl->oem_id`, `tbl->oem_table_id`, or `tbl->oem_revision` will cause a runtime crash due to null pointer dereference.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: After the line `if (ACPI_FAILURE(status) || !tbl) return;`, ensure that `tbl` is always checked for being non-NULL before dereferencing it later in the function, even under scenarios where `status != ACPI_FAILURE`.  

Example fix:  
```c
if (!tbl) return;
```
