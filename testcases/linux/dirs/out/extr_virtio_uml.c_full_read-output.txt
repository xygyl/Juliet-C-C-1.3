UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Pointer arithmetic on a `void*` (i.e., `buf += rc;`) is undefined behavior in C. According to the C standard, pointer arithmetic is only valid on pointers with complete object types, such as `char*` or `int*`. `void*` does not have a defined size, so the operation `buf += rc` is UB.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The UB caused by `buf += rc;` may lead to incorrect memory access or computation. The function may try to write data to an unintended memory location if the value of `buf` changes incorrectly due to undefined behavior. This could lead to potential crashes or data corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Instead of using `void*` for arithmetic, cast `buf` to `(char*)` before performing the pointer arithmetic. For example:
```c
    buf = (char*)buf + rc;
```  
This cast ensures the pointer arithmetic operates correctly based on byte-sized increments.
