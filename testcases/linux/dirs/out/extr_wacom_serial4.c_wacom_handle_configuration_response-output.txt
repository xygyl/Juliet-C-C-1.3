UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The variable `skip` is used multiple times in the call to `sscanf`, and depending on the input format, it could lead to undefined behavior (even if just as an unlikely corner case). If `wacom->data` is improperly formatted or not guaranteed non-null or in *UP plausible segments P in alternate problem return forms`, Uninitialized may run.  

Bug Detected: somewhatyes----Retroactively-off-on canned-off---inline.<
