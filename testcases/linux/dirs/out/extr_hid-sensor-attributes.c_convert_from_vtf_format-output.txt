UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The calculation `(1LL << (size * 8)) - value` can lead to undefined behavior due to left-shifting beyond the width of the `long long` type (usually 64 bits). Specifically, if `size * 8` exceeds the number of bits in a `long long` (e.g., 64 on most systems), the operation is undefined. Also, there is no explicit check for `size`, which means invalid values like `size > 8` can trigger undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: There is no validation to ensure `size * 8` is an appropriate value for the bit manipulation `(1LL << (size * 8))`. The logic assumes that `size` is within valid bounds but does not guard against invalid inputs, leading potentially to misbehavior or incorrect results.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check early in the function to ensure `size` is limited to a valid range, such as 1 to 8. For example:

```c
if (size <= 0 || size > 8) {
    *val1 = 0;
    *val2 = 0;
    return;
}
```

This ensures that `(1LL << (size * 8))` will not evaluate to undefined behavior. Additionally, verify the validity of the input `value` and consider adding documentation to clarify the expected ranges of all parameters.
