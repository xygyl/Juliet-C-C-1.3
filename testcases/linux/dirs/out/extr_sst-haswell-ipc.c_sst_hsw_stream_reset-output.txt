Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sst-haswell-ipc.c_sst_hsw_stream_reset.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Access to `stream->running` and `stream->reply.stream_hw_id` could occur when `stream` is NULL. Even though the initial check (`if (!stream)`) handles the case before accessing these members, the assumption might fail if accessed elsewhere in practice due to structure inconsistencies or manual updates in a larger codebase.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: Waiting for `stream->running` using `msleep(1)` with a fixed limit of 10 iterations may fail if `stream->running` persists for more than 10ms. This could lead to unhandled behavior and premature exit without proper reset. Additionally, the error handling pathway doesnâ€™t provide corrective measures beyond returning `-EINVAL`.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Increase the iteration count for `tries` to allow for longer waiting periods, or introduce retry mechanisms with timeout conditions configurable by the calling code. Ensure defensive programming patterns, like handling the NULL condition for `stream` in all pathways, including during construction and interactions across functions in the codebase.
