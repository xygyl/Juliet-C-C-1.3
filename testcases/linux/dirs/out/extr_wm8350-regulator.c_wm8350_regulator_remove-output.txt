Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_wm8350-regulator.c_wm8350_regulator_remove.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible out-of-bounds access in `wm8350_reg[pdev->id].irq`. `pdev->id` appears to be used as an index to `wm8350_reg`, but the code does not verify that `id` is within the valid range of the array. This could lead to undefined behavior due to accessing memory outside the bounds of the `wm8350_reg` array.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw (Out-of-Bounds Array Access)  
Bug Reason: An unchecked use of `pdev->id` as an index into the `wm8350_reg` array assumes that `id` is within a valid range. If `id` exceeds the bounds of `wm8350_reg`, memory corruption or segmentation faults may occur.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `pdev->id` is within the valid range of indices for the `wm8350_reg` array before performing the `wm8350_reg[pdev->id].irq` access. For example:  
```c
if (pdev->id >= MAX_REGULATORS) {  
    return -EINVAL;  
}
```  
Where `MAX_REGULATORS` is the size of the `wm8350_reg` array.
