### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `blob_equal` function does not explicitly check if `a` or `b` are `NULL` before dereferencing their `length` or `data` members. If either `a` or `b` is `NULL`, accessing `a->length`, `b->length`, `a->data`, or `b->data` results in undefined behavior because dereferencing `NULL` pointers is undefined in C.

### Bug Analysis:  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `a` and `b` are valid pointers without ensuring they are non-NULL before accessing their members via dereferencing. While there is a comparison (`if (a && b)`), this does not guarantee that `a` or `b` are non-NULL at every dereference in the function because the condition `return !a == !b;` allows them to be `NULL`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

---

### Fix Suggestion:  
Add NULL pointer checks for `a` and `b` before accessing their members. For example:
```c
if (!a || !b) 
    return !a && !b;

return a->length == b->length &&
       !memcmp(a->data, b->data, a->length);
```
This ensures valid pointers are accessed in all cases and prevents both undefined behavior and the null pointer dereference bug.
