UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow may occur during operations like `pll_freq_u64 = (u64)pll_freq_word << 28L`. The left shift of a value may result in an overflow if `pll_freq_word` contains a sufficiently high value. The C standard does not define behavior for `<<` operations resulting in values exceeding the representable range of the type.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer overflow, Logic flaw
Bug Reason: Integer overflow during left shift (`pll_freq_u64 = (u64)pll_freq_word << 28L`) and a potentially flawed logic in spectral inversion handling where manipulation of `if_freq` could lead to unexpected behavior due to heavy reliance on hardcoded constants (`400000`, range checks) without robust validation of input values.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Validate `pll_freq_word` to ensure it will not cause an overflow during left shift. If the bit-width exceeds the bounds of `u64`, consider capping or logging an error.  
2. Add bounds checking for `if_freq` prior to calculations. Ensure `if_freq` undergoes proper validation before arithmetic operations like subtraction of 400,000. Clarify inputs with robust constraints and ensure spectral inversion does not have unintended effects based on edge-case calculations.
