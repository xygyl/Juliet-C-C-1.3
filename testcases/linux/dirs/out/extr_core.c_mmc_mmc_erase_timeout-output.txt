Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_core.c_mmc_mmc_erase_timeout.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is potential for division by zero in the calculation `(card->host->ios.clock / 1000)` if `card->host->ios.clock` is zero. Additionally, shifting integers `(timeout_clks <<= 1)` could potentially result in an overflow if `timeout_clks` reaches a value exceeding the maximum representation of `unsigned int`. Neither scenario is explicitly handled.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Division by zero, potential integer overflow  
Bug Reason: The division by `card->host->ios.clock / 1000` is unsafe if `card->host->ios.clock` is zero because it will lead to undefined behavior. The left shift operation `timeout_clks <<= 1` is unchecked and may cause an integer overflow, though the exact conditions depend on runtime values.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
- Add a check to ensure `card->host->ios.clock` is nonzero before performing the division. For example:  
  ```c  
  if (card->host->ios.clock == 0) {  
      erase_timeout = 1000; /* Fallback to a safe default timeout */  
  } else {  
      timeout_us += (timeout_clks * 1000) / (card->host->ios.clock / 1000);  
  }  
  ```  
- Validate that the left shift of `timeout_clks <<= 1` does not overflow and stays within the bounds of `unsigned int`. Add checks using limits from `limits.h`, such as `UINT_MAX`, to avoid overflow.
