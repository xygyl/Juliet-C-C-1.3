### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `obj->state` is `NULL`, the use of `kmemdup(obj->state, sizeof(*st), GFP_KERNEL)` will dereference a null pointer, which is undefined behavior according to the C standard. There's no check to ensure `obj->state` is a valid pointer before it is passed to `kmemdup`.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `obj->state` is a valid pointer without verifying it. If `obj->state` is `NULL`, this will trigger a null pointer dereference when `kmemdup` tries to perform the duplication. Moreover, it can result in the function returning `NULL`, which might not be checked properly in the caller, leading to further issues.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence:
High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Add a null pointer check for `obj->state` at the start of the function. For example:  
```c
if (!obj->state)
    return NULL;
```  

Alternatively, review upstream logic to ensure `obj->state` is always valid before calling this function.
