Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_readdir.c_cifs_fill_dirent_unix.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `info->FileName` is a null pointer, accessing `info->FileName[0]` causes undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer. Similarly, other fields like `ResumeKey` and `basic.UniqueId` could also lead to UB if `info` is null.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether `info` and its fields (e.g., `FileName`) are non-null before using them, which may lead to a null pointer dereference.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to ensure `info` and relevant fields (like `FileName`) are not null before using them. For example:
```c
if (!info || !info->FileName) {
    // Handle error or return
    return;
}
```
