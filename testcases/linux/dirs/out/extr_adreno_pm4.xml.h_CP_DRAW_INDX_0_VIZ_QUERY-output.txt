UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If the input `val` exceeds the width of CP_DRAW_INDX_0_VIZ_QUERY__MASK (i.e., its bit-width), the operation `(val << CP_DRAW_INDX_0_VIZ_QUERY__SHIFT)` may cause overflow or shift by a value outside the allowed bounds, resulting in undefined behavior as per the C standard. Specifically, left-shifting a value greater than or equal to the number of bits in `uint32_t` is undefined.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential Logic Error
Bug Reason: The logic could misuse `val` if it is larger than the field specified by the mask (i.e., CP_DRAW_INDX_0_VIZ_QUERY__MASK). Certain values of `val` may inadvertently clear unrelated bits, violating design intent, especially if normalization to a bit range isn't ensured.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before performing the left shift, ensure that `val` is masked appropriately to prevent undefined behavior. For example:
```c
return ((val & CP_DRAW_INDX_0_VIZ_QUERY__MASK) << CP_DRAW_INDX_0_VIZ_QUERY__SHIFT);
```
This ensures the input `val` only operates within the intended range.

Alternatively, add range checks for `val` to guarantee safe usage:
```c
if (val < (1U << (32 - CP_DRAW_INDX_0_VIZ_QUERY__SHIFT))) {
    return ((val << CP_DRAW_INDX_0_VIZ_QUERY__SHIFT) & CP_DRAW_INDX_0_VIZ_QUERY__MASK);
} else {
    /* Handle error appropriately */
}
