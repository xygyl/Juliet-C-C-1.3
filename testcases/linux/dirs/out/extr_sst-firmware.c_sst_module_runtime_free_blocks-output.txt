Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sst-firmware.c_sst_module_runtime_free_blocks.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not check if the `runtime` pointer is NULL before dereferencing it. If the caller passes a NULL `runtime` pointer, this constitutes undefined behavior due to dereferencing a NULL pointer (`runtime->dsp` and `&runtime->block_list`).
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: Dereferencing a potentially NULL pointer (`runtime`) leads to a crash or other unpredictable behavior. This is a logic flaw as the function assumes `runtime` is always non-NULL.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to verify that `runtime` is not NULL:
```c
if (!runtime)
    return -EINVAL; // Or another appropriate error code
```
This ensures that operations on `runtime` do not cause undefined behavior.
