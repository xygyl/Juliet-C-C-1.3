UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses the `memcpy()` call which copies data into `info->oid.data`. There is no verification that `info->oid.data` or `gm->gm_oid.data` points to valid allocated memory with sufficient size. Dereferencing invalid or unallocated pointers results in undefined behavior. If `gm->gm_oid.len` exceeds the allocated size of `info->oid.data`, this results in buffer overflow. Additionally, pointer member accesses `gm` and `gm->gm_oid` require validation to ensure non-null prior to dereferencing, or undefined behavior may occur if the pointer is invalid.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow / Memory Safety Issue  
Bug Reason: If `gm->gm_oid.len` exceeds the available buffer size of `info->oid.data`, it results in a buffer overflow. Furthermore, if `gm` is `NULL` or `gm->gm_oid.data` is `NULL`, and no checks are made prior to their use, the program may dereference null pointers, causing runtime crashes.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Validate the pointer `info->oid.data`, `gm`, and `gm->gm_oid.data` before use.
2. Check if `info->oid.data` has sufficient size to accommodate `gm->gm_oid.len` before calling `memcpy()`. Add appropriate bounds and error handling.
3. If the buffer size is not guaranteed by external codeflow, allocate or verify appropriate memory before performing the copy operation.
