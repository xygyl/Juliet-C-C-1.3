UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The line `from += 4;` performs pointer arithmetic on a `const void *`. Pointer arithmetic on `void *` (or `const void *`) is undefined behavior because the size of `void` is unknown and the C standard specifies that addition or subtraction to/from a `void *` results in UB. This operation should be performed on a pointer with a defined type, such as `const uint8_t *`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Pointer Arithmetic Bug
Bug Reason: The undefined behavior caused by pointer arithmetic could lead to incorrect memory access and potentially corrupt data or crash the program. For example, in environments where `void *` arithmetic is implemented as a compiler extension, this may cause portability issues or unexpected results.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Change the type of `from` to `const uint8_t *` to allow safe pointer arithmetic. If it is known that the data pointed to by `from` is 4-byte aligned and of `uint32_t` type, you can use `const uint32_t *` instead.

Example Fix:
```c
static void dc21285_copy_to_32(struct map_info *map, unsigned long to, const void *from_void, ssize_t len)
{
    const uint32_t *from = (const uint32_t *)from_void;
    while (len > 0) {
        map_word d;
        d.x[0] = *from;
        dc21285_write32(map, d, to);
        from += 1; // Increment by element step within uint32_t.
        to += 4;
        len -= 4;
    }
}
```
This fix ensures safe and defined pointer arithmetic.
