Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vimc-common.c_vimc_pix_map_by_code.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `vimc_pix_map_list` is used in `ARRAY_SIZE()` and later indexed assuming it is a statically allocated array. However, its definition is missing, making its type unclear. If `vimc_pix_map_list` is a pointer and not an array, this results in undefined behavior as pointer arithmetic and sizing against pointers are invalid.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: If `vimc_pix_map_list` is a pointer to dynamically allocated memory instead of a static array, `ARRAY_SIZE(vimc_pix_map_list)` does not calculate the correct number of elements. This would lead to an out-of-bounds access when `i` exceeds the actual count of elements.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Define `vimc_pix_map_list` explicitly as a static array and ensure that it is not mistakenly replaced by a pointer elsewhere in the codebase. Alternatively, maintain an explicit count of elements if `vimc_pix_map_list` is dynamically allocated. Example:  
```c
#define ARRAY_SIZE(arr) (sizeof(arr) / sizeof((arr)[0]))
static struct vimc_pix_map vimc_pix_map_list[] = { /* Initialize the array elements here */ };
```
Or, if dynamic allocation is used, replace `ARRAY_SIZE(vimc_pix_map_list)` with a variable storing the number of elements in the array.
