Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_asn1_compiler.c_parse.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing an invalid pointer due to assumptions about the `cursor` and `type->name` pointer values without prior validation. Specifically, the function assumes `type->name` points to a valid sequence of tokens without verifying bounds, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory access when incrementing the `cursor` pointer. Also, signed integer overflow on `cursor->line` could occur during memory access operations, depending on how token is populated by external code.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory-related bug  
Bug Reason: The pointer arithmetic operations (`cursor += 2`, `type++`) and dereferencing operations assume valid memory layout without checks; there is a possibility of accessing uninitialized or invalid memory, particularly if `type->name` or `type->element` were improperly allocated or null. Additionally, the program does not handle cases where `parse_type()` or `abort()` might leave the `cursor` in an undefined state or mismatch bounds.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to ensure `type->name` and the pointers in `cursor` point to valid memory ranges before performing pointer arithmetic. Validate the `cursor` position after `parse_type()` to confirm it lies within safe bounds. Replace direct dereferencing with bounds-checked operations and handle potential null pointers gracefully.
