Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cc_hash.c_cc_alloc_ctx.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code casts the potentially null pointer `ctx->digest_buff` and `ctx->opad_tmp_keys_buff` to `(void *)`, but there is no check for their initialization or validity. Accessing or mapping uninitialized or null pointers for DMA purposes will invoke Undefined Behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related bug
Bug Reason: If `ctx->digest_buff` or `ctx->opad_tmp_keys_buff` is null due to improper initialization, the DMA operations (`dma_map_single`) will operate on invalid memory, potentially causing memory corruption or illegal access errors. Moreover, the code does not explicitly handle cleanup if these buffers are invalid before retrying allocation; this could lead to resource/heap-related issues.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before performing `dma_map_single`, check that both `ctx->digest_buff` and `ctx->opad_tmp_keys_buff` are properly initialized and non-null. Add validation logic like:
```c
if (!ctx->digest_buff || !ctx->opad_tmp_keys_buff) {
    dev_err(dev, "Buffer allocation failed. Buffers must be initialized before mapping.\n");
    goto fail;
}
```
Alternatively, ensure these buffers are allocated or initialized adequately before calling the `cc_alloc_ctx` function.
