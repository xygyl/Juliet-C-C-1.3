UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The calculation of `reg_addr` uses `VPDMA_INT_LIST0_STAT + VPDMA_INTX_OFFSET * irq_num`. If `irq_num` is negative, this causes an invalid calculation for the `reg_addr`, potentially resulting in undefined behavior when the address is passed to `read_reg()`. Additionally, there is no check to ensure `irq_num` stays within valid bounds, which could cause a mapping to invalid memory.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related bug
Bug Reason: The lack of validation for the `irq_num` argument may lead to out-of-bound memory access when `read_reg` is called with an incorrectly calculated `reg_addr`. This is a logical flaw because invalid or unintended `irq_num` values might cause the program to read memory at unintended locations, breaching system stability and safety.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add validation to ensure `irq_num` is non-negative and within the range of feasible values (for instance, based on the number of known interrupt sources). Use assertions or explicit checks:
```c
if (irq_num < 0 || irq_num >= MAX_IRQ_NUM) {
    return 0; // Or handle the error appropriately
}
u32 reg_addr = VPDMA_INT_LIST0_STAT + VPDMA_INTX_OFFSET * irq_num;
return read_reg(vpdma, reg_addr);
```
