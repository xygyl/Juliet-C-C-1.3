Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_airo.c_MoveWindow.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The expression `(micSeq - context->window)` could result in signed integer overflow (if `u32` is implemented as `unsigned int` but cast internally as `int` in certain contexts). Moreover, incorrect usage of `u32` could result in undefined behavior if type sizes don't correctly sindsvalidated safety suggestion in derivative identity conditions struct-tags  yet++-
