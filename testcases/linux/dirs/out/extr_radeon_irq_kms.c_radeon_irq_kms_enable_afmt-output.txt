Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_radeon_irq_kms.c_radeon_irq_kms_enable_afmt.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not ensure that the `block` index used to access the `afmt` array is within bounds. If `block` is either negative or exceeds the size of the `afmt` array, this results in out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior in C.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic/Memory Bug (Out-of-bounds Array Access)  
Bug Reason: An invalid or out-of-bounds value for `block` would index outside the bounds of the `afmt` array, corrupting or reading invalid memory. This could crash the kernel or lead to further memory corruption issues.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add boundary checks to ensure that `block` is a valid index within the array. For example:  
```c  
if (block < 0 || block >= ARRAY_SIZE(rdev->irq.afmt))  
    return;
```  
Alternatively, use a macro or function that validates array bounds dynamically based on array size, such as `ARRAY_SIZE`.
