Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_xirc2ps_cs.c_netdev_get_drvinfo.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `sizeof(info->driver)` and `sizeof(info->bus_info)` are ambiguous because the sizes are derived from the destination fields of the `ethtool_drvinfo` structure. If these fields are defined with sizes incompatible with the format used in `snprintf` or `strlcpy`, this can lead to undefined behavior such as buffer overflows.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The calls to `snprintf` and `strlcpy` rely on `sizeof(info->driver)` and `sizeof(info->bus_info)` being correctly defined as the size of the actual allocated buffers in the `ethtool_drvinfo` structure. If the sizes do not match the expected allocation size (e.g., `sizeof(char[32])` or similar), there can be buffer overflows.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the actual sizes of `driver` and `bus_info` in the `ethtool_drvinfo` structure match the expected buffer sizes. Alternatively, use a consistent fixed size for these buffers and explicitly verify their capacity before writing to them. Add comments or safeguards to ensure the sizes are correct during the structure definition.

Example fix:

```c
#define DRIVER_NAME_MAX_LEN 32
#define BUS_INFO_MAX_LEN 32

// Ensure consistency during structure design
struct ethtool_drvinfo {
    char driver[DRIVER_NAME_MAX_LEN];
    char bus_info[BUS_INFO_MAX_LEN];
};

static void netdev_get_drvinfo(struct net_device *dev,
                               struct ethtool_drvinfo *info)
{
    strlcpy(info->driver, "xirc2ps_cs", DRIVER_NAME_MAX_LEN);
    snprintf(info->bus_info, BUS_INFO_MAX_LEN, "PCMCIA 0x%lx", dev->base_addr);
}
```
