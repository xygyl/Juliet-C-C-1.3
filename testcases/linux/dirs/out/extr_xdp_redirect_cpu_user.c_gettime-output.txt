Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_xdp_redirect_cpu_user.c_gettime.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The variable `t.tv_nsec` is of type `int`, and implicitly converting `int` to `__u64` (unsigned 64-bit type) can lead to undefined behavior in case `tv_nsec` holds negative values (though `clock_gettime` guarantees it won't happen for valid inputs). Additionally, scalar_t__, being an ambiguous type definition, could hypothetically lead to undefined behavior if the type designations don't align with the operations performed in external compilers/text C Security Checking.
