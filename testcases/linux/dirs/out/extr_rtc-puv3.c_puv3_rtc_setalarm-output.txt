Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_rtc-puv3.c_puv3_rtc_setalarm.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The call to `dev_dbg(dev, "set alarm: %d, %ptRr\n", alrm->enabled, tm);` contains a format specifier `%ptRr` which is not standard in the C language. If the `%ptRr` format specifier expects a pointer of type `struct rtc_time`, but it isn't supported or implemented in the specific context of Linux kernel debug infrastructure, this could lead to undefined behavior elsewhere. Also, scalar variables (like `unsigned long rtcalarm_count`) are not guaranteed to be correctly initialized before use. In the absence of a static analyzer, runtime miscompilation may occur.
