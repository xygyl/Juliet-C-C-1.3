Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_ppc4xx_edac.c_ppc4xx_edac_register_irq.c
UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function does not contain any evident forms of undefined behavior according to the C standard. All pointers (e.g., `np` and `mci`) are assumed to be valid since they originate as arguments. There is no signed integer overflow, invalid pointer dereference, out-of-bounds memory access, or strict aliasing violation. The use of `free_irq` and `request_irq` appears compliant with general kernel coding practices.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Bug
Bug Reason: The `free_irq(sec_irq, mci)` in the `fail2` block mistakenly tries to free `sec_irq`, but `request_irq` for `sec_irq` was unsuccessful and thus the IRQ is not allocated. This could lead to undefined behavior if the kernel expects a valid IRQ to have been allocated before freeing. Similarly, the `fail1` block calls `free_irq(ded_irq, mci)` even though the `request_irq` for `ded_irq` may not have succeeded.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `free_irq` is called only if the respective `request_irq` call succeeded. For example, use boolean flags to track whether each `request_irq` succeeded and check these flags before calling `free_irq`.

Correct implementation:
```c
int ded_success = 0, sec_success = 0;

status = request_irq(ded_irq, ppc4xx_edac_isr, 0, "[EDAC] MC ECCDED", mci);
if (status >= 0) {
    ded_success = 1;
} else {
    ppc4xx_edac_mc_printk(KERN_ERR, mci, "Unable to request irq %d for ECC DED", ded_irq);
    status = -ENODEV;
    goto fail;
}

status = request_irq(sec_irq, ppc4xx_edac_isr, 0, "[EDAC] MC ECCSEC", mci);
if (status >= 0) {
    sec_success = 1;
} else {
    ppc4xx_edac_mc_printk(KERN_ERR, mci, "Unable to request irq %d for ECC SEC", sec_irq);
    status = -ENODEV;
    goto fail2;
}

pdata->irqs.ded = ded_irq;
pdata->irqs.sec = sec_irq;

return 0;

fail2:
if (ded_success)
    free_irq(ded_irq, mci);

fail:
return status;
```
