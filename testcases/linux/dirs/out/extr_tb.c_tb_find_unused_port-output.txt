Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_tb.c_tb_find_unused_port.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Array out-of-bounds access is possible. The `sw->ports` array is accessed with index values up to `sw->config.max_port_number`, and there is no guarantee that `max_port_number` is within the bounds of the allocated array. This could result in undefined behavior if `max_port_number` exceeds the size of the array.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Array Out-of-Bounds  
Bug Reason: The loop uses the condition `i <= sw->config.max_port_number` without verifying that `max_port_number` does not exceed the actual bounds of the `ports` array. As a result, accessing `sw->ports[i]` could potentially result in out-of-bounds memory access.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `sw->config.max_port_number` does not exceed the actual size of the `ports` array before using it in the loop condition. For example:
```c
int max_port_idx = sw->config.max_port_number;
if (max_port_idx > ACTUAL_PORT_ARRAY_SIZE) // Replace ACTUAL_PORT_ARRAY_SIZE with the actual size of the ports array
    max_port_idx = ACTUAL_PORT_ARRAY_SIZE;

for (i = 1; i <= max_port_idx; i++) {
    ...
}
```
This ensures the loop does not access elements beyond the allocated range of the array.
