UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses pointer arithmetic (`ptr + (len - 512)`) on a `const void *` type, which violates the standard; pointer arithmetic is not defined for `void*` because the size of the pointed-to object is unknown. Cast `ptr` to a `const char*` or similar explicitly before doing arithmetic.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The usage of `ptr + (len - 512)` in the context of `const void*` may lead to incorrect memory access, as `void*` does not define proper arithmetic behavior. Combined with the UB mentioned, this can cause runtime errors or produce incorrect results. Additionally, the truncation message printed via `pr_info()` specifies the length being reduced properly but the underlying code may miscalculate offsets due to UB.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Cast `ptr` to `const char*` explicitly before performing pointer arithmetic, such as `((const char*)ptr) + (len - 512)`. This avoids UB and ensures that the offsets are calculated correctly based on byte-sized pointers.

Example fix:
```c
print_hex_dump(KERN_INFO, pre,
               DUMP_PREFIX_OFFSET, 16, 1,
               (const char*)ptr + (len - 512), 512, 0);
```
