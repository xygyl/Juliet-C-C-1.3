UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Pointer arithmetic (`ptr += sizeof(*ev) + ev->length`) is performed on `ptr`, but no validation is done to ensure `ev->length` fits within the boundaries of `skb->data`. This could lead to out-of-bounds access, which is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Access  
Bug Reason: The `ev->length` field is read directly from `skb->data` without validating that the provided value does not lead to memory access past the end of `skb->data`. If `skb->data` is shorter than the calculated size (`sizeof(*ev) + ev->length`), memory corruption or information leakage could occur.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate the calculated size (`sizeof(*ev) + ev->length`) before accessing memory. Ensure it does not exceed the actual size of `skb->data`. You can track the remaining valid memory in `skb->data` by updating a `remaining_size` variable and checking its value before performing pointer arithmetic or dereferencing.
