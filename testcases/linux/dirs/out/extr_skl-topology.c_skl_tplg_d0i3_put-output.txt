Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_skl-topology.c_skl_tplg_d0i3_put.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The decrement operations (`d0i3->non_d0i3--`, `d0i3->streaming--`, `d0i3->non_streaming--`) in the `switch` statement are performed without verifying whether any of these fields are already zero. If a field has a value of zero and is decremented, this leads to an integer overflow, resulting in undefined behavior for signed integers as per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw and potential incorrect behavior
Bug Reason: The potential integer underflow due to decrementing counters without bounds checking can cause incorrect logic or functionality elsewhere in the program. For instance, any further logic relying on these counters may behave unpredictably if they contain negative values.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking before decrementing the fields to ensure no negative values are produced. For instance:
```c
switch (caps) {
    case SKL_D0I3_NONE:
        if (d0i3->non_d0i3 > 0)
            d0i3->non_d0i3--;
        break;

    case SKL_D0I3_STREAMING:
        if (d0i3->streaming > 0)
            d0i3->streaming--;
        break;

    case SKL_D0I3_NON_STREAMING:
        if (d0i3->non_streaming > 0)
            d0i3->non_streaming--;
        break;
}
```
This ensures the variables do not decrement below zero and avoids undefined behavior.
