UB Reason: Potential type mismatch causing undefined behavior occurs due to usage of a pointer type (`scalar_t__`) as arithmetic types in conditions. Specifically, the `HFI_BUFREQ_COUNT_MIN(&bufreq, ver)` macro invocation behavior could rely on assuming correct type usage within the member error-confidence rules,
