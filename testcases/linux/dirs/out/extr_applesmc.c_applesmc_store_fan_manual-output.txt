UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function may access undefined memory if the `to_index(attr)` function returns a value outside the valid range of bits in `val`. This could lead to buffer overflows or rules of C undefined behavior because bit shifts greater than the width of the integer cause UB.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The `to_index(attr)` value is not validated before being used as a bitwise offset to potentially manipulate bits beyond the valid range of `u16`. Another possible logic flaw is that the function does not check whether `applesmc_read_key` or `applesmc_write_key` properly handle invalid input sizes, as `buffer` is hardcoded to size 2, whereas the functions may require other sizes, resulting in memory corruption or incorrect fan configuration.
  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `to_index(attr)` returns a value within the valid range `[0, 15]`, as `val` is a `u16` and only supports 16 bits. Add explicit checks for the size of the `buffer` passed to `applesmc_read_key()` and `applesmc_write_key()` to ensure it matches the expected size. Example:

```c
int index = to_index(attr);
if (index < 0 || index > 15) {
    return -EINVAL;
}

// Ensure buffer size matches expected size for the key
if (sizeof(buffer) < 2) {
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
