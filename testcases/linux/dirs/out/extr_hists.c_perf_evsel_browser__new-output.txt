Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hists.c_perf_evsel_browser__new.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not check the return value of `hist_browser__new(evsel__hists(evsel))` before dereferencing its result. If `hist_browser__new(evsel__hists(evsel))` returns a null pointer (for example, due to a failure to allocate memory), then dereferencing it would result in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The `browser` pointer is dereferenced without ensuring it's not `NULL`. If `hist_browser__new(evsel__hists(evsel))` fails, this could result in a runtime crash due to null pointer dereference when accessing its fields such as `hbt`, `env`, `title`, or `annotation_opts`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to verify that `browser` is not `NULL` before executing the assignment and member accesses. For example:
```c
if (browser) {
    browser->hbt   = hbt;
    browser->env   = env;
    browser->title = hists_browser__scnprintf_title;
    browser->annotation_opts = annotation_opts;
}
return browser;
```
Alternatively, handle the error and propagate it explicitly if `hist_browser__new` fails.
