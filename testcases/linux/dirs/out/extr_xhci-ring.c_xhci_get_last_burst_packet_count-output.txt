### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The subtraction operation in `return residue - 1;` is performed without checking if `residue` can be zero. If `residue == 0`, this will result in an unsigned integer underflow, which is a form of undefined behavior in C.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Underflow  
Bug Reason: When `residue` is 0, computing `residue - 1` causes an underflow since `residue` is an unsigned integer type. The subtraction results in a very large value due to wraparound behavior, which can lead to incorrect return values.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
To prevent underflow, add a check to handle the case when `residue` is 0 before performing the subtraction. For example:
```c
if (residue == 0)
    return 0;  // Handle the case separately
return residue - 1;
```
This ensures safe operations and prevents undefined behavior.
