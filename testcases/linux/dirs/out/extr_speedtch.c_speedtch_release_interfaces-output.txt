### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not perform any operations that clearly violate the C standard's rules for undefined behavior. It checks for a `NULL` condition before operating on pointers, avoids invalid memory access, and does not modify or dereference uninitialized pointers.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: NULL pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: Although the function checks whether `cur_intf` is non-NULL before calling `usb_set_intfdata()` and `usb_driver_release_interface()`, it does not check whether `usb_dev` itself is a valid pointer. If `usb_dev` is NULL, the `usb_ifnum_to_if()` function will likely dereference it or behave in undefined ways depending on its implementation. This can lead to a potential NULL pointer dereference.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
To prevent potential NULL pointer dereferencing, add a check for `usb_dev` at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (usb_dev == NULL)
    return;
```
This ensures that the function safely exits without doing anything if the `usb_dev` pointer is NULL.
