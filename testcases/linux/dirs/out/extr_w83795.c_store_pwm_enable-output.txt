Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_w83795.c_store_pwm_enable.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `index` variable, drawn from `sensor_attr->index`, is used as a bitwise shift value (`1 << index`) without verifying that `index` is within valid bounds for bit shifting (0 to the width of `int` minus 1, usually 0-31 for a 32-bit `int`). If `index` exceeds this range, it will invoke undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: Dependent on the undefined behavior, the function might misconfigure data->pwm_fcms or data->pwm_tfmr when an out-of-range index is provided. Furthermore, an improper `index` could access invalid array locations, leading to further incorrect behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate `sensor_attr->index` before using it for bitwise operations or array indexing. Add a check such as:
```c
if (index < 0 || index >= sizeof(int) * 8) // Adjust range depending on the data size of pwm_fcms and pwm_tfmr arrays.
    return -EINVAL;
```
Additionally, confirm that `index < ARRAY_SIZE(data->pwm_tfmr)` to ensure the array bounds are respected.
