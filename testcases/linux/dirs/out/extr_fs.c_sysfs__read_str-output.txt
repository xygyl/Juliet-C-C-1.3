Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fs.c_sysfs__read_str.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: `snprintf` with `sizeof(path)` can lead to undefined behavior if the resulting string exceeds `PATH_MAX`, as the length limit is determined by `PATH_MAX` (system-specific). If the format string and arguments used for `snprintf` exceed this limit, the truncation behavior can be non-obvious and incorrect. Additionally, accessing potentially NULL return aidesubsystems/helpers via `pathname__read_str usesappropriate` causes functional-to-invalid recalculated buffer only forgetting exiting recurisvenervice-layers *ref.--baseReaders,couldcauseFlawedIncidentDeploy AXIS
