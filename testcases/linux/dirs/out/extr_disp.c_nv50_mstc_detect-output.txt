UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `pm_runtime_get_sync()` can return negative error codes, and they are checked using `ret < 0 && ret != -EACCES`. However, if `ret == -EACCES`, the code maintains the use of the runtime PM system but skips the `pm_runtime_mark_last_busy()` and `pm_runtime_put_autosuspend()` calls to balance runtime PM usage. This leads to a potential misalignment between the PM runtime reference count and usage, causing undefined behavior in hardware or the kernel runtime. Runtime PM operations must be properly balanced regardless of error hit unless explicitly documented otherwise.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The logic flaw described above can lead to possible discrepancies in runtime PM usage, potentially causing issues such as device power state inconsistency or failure. Specifically, the failure to call `pm_runtime_mark_last_busy()` and `pm_runtime_put_autosuspend()` when an `-EACCES` error is returned leaves the PM systemâ€™s state ambiguous. This might cause subtle bugs in scenarios dependent on the device's runtime PM state.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that any paths handling errors from `pm_runtime_get_sync()` explicitly and cleanly balance the runtime PM system reference count and usage markers. For instance:  
```c
if (ret < 0) {
    pm_runtime_put_autosuspend(connector->dev->dev);
    return connector_status_disconnected;
}
```  
This ensures a consistent runtime PM reference count, even in error conditions. Document any unavoidable exceptions explicitly.
