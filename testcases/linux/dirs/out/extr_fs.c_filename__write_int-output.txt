Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fs.c_filename__write_int.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `sprintf` function writes a formatted string to `buf` assuming that its contents can fully accommodate the string representation of `value`. If the formatted string exceeds the size of `buf` (64 bytes), this causes a buffer overflow, which is undefined behavior. Additionally, the comparison `write(fd, buf, sizeof(buf)) == sizeof(buf)` is problematic since the full buffer (`sizeof(buf)`) is written regardless of the actual string produced by `sprintf`. This can lead to writing uninitialized memory or garbage values from the buffer.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The use of `sprintf` coupled with writing a fixed-size buffer (64 bytes) instead of the actual length of the formatted string can cause memory corruption by overflowing the buffer `buf`. Furthermore, writing excess garbage data from `buf` after the formatted string can cause incorrect file output. Logic-wise, the function might incorrectly set `err` to `0` even if any error occurs in `write()` because it assumes the entire buffer size was written successfully.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
- Use `snprintf` instead of `sprintf` to ensure that the formatted string fits within the `buf` buffer safely. Check the return value of `snprintf` to confirm the string was successfully written without truncation.  
- Use `strlen(buf)` to determine the correct number of bytes to write in the `write()` call instead of `sizeof(buf)`. Update the comparison accordingly.
- Fix the logic to verify the actual successful write length and handle errors more robustly.

Updated code:
```c
int filename__write_int(const char *filename, int value)
{
	int fd = open(filename, O_WRONLY), err = -1;
	char buf[64];
	int len;

	if (fd < 0)
		return err;

	len = snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "%d", value);
	if (len < 0 || len >= sizeof(buf)) {
		close(fd);
		return err; // snprintf failed or truncated output
	}

	if (write(fd, buf, len) == len)
		err = 0;

	close(fd);
	return err;
}
```  
This ensures safer handling of buffer size and correct operation logic.
