UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function has potential undefined behavior due to the macro `SET_BIT` and `CLR_BIT`. These macros may not perform proper masking if they rely on undefined shifts (such as shifting by more than the width of the type). The behavior of left or right shifts that exceed the width of the type is undefined in C.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: A mode of `4` explicitly maps to setting the bit (`SET_BIT`) and `8` maps to clearing it (`CLR_BIT`). While this logic may work correctly with present hardware/software assumptions, it would break if additional modes were added (invalid assumptions on input validation). No mode values outside `4` and ` are=` reach.
