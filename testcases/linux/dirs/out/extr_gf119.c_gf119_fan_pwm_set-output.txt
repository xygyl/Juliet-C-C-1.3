UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function `pwm_info()` is invoked, but its definition is not provided in the available code. If `pwm_info()` returns an out-of-bounds value (e.g., `indx < 0` for the first branch or a value incorrect for the subsequent logic branches), it could lead to undefined behavior when performing calculations and pointer arithmetic based on invalid indexes.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The function assumes `pwm_info()` always returns a valid index (`indx`) without robust checking beyond `indx < 0`. If `indx` were greater than the permissible range (e.g., `> 2`), the conditional branches would fail to address this, causing operations on potentially invalid memory locations.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion:
- Validate the range of `indx` returned by `pwm_info()` before proceeding with any conditional processing.
- Example:
```c
if (indx < 0 || indx > 2) {
    return -EINVAL; // or handle invalid index appropriately
}
```
This ensures `indx` is within a valid range before any operations are performed.
