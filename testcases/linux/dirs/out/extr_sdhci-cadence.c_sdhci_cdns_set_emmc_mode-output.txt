UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences `priv->hrs_addr` in the expression `priv->hrs_addr + SDHCI_CDNS_HRS06` without verifying if `priv` is non-NULL. If `priv` is NULL, adding to `priv->hrs_addr` and passing it to `readl()` or `writel()` results in undefined behavior due to the null pointer dereference.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `priv` is NULL, the function will attempt to dereference `priv->hrs_addr` and will then likely crash or exhibit undefined behavior during these memory accesses.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a check to validate that the `priv` pointer is non-NULL at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!priv) {
    return; // Handle the error appropriately
}
```
