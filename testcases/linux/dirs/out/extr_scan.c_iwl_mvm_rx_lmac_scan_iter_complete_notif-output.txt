Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_scan.c_iwl_mvm_rx_lmac_scan_iter_complete_notif.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential strict-aliasing violation when casting `pkt->data` (of type `scalar_t__`) to `(struct iwl_lmac_scan_complete_notif *)`. The `scalar_t__` type could alias any arithmetic or pointer type, leading to undefined behavior as per strict-aliasing rules.
Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: None
Bug Reason: The function logic appears correct and no evident memory, logic, or other defects were detected. While the cast might cause undefined behavior, it does not impact the functional correctness in the provided context.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Instead of direct casting, use `memcpy` to safely copy the `data` buffer to a properly allocated variable of type `struct iwl_lmac_scan_complete_notif` to ensure compliance with strict-aliasing rules.
