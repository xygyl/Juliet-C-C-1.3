Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cpufreq_spudemand.c_spu_gov_cancel_work.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences the `info` pointer without validating whether it is NULL. If `info` is passed as NULL at runtime, this would result in a null pointer dereference, invoking undefined behavior as per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If the `info` pointer is NULL, attempting to dereference it with `cancel_delayed_work_sync(&info->work)` in the function will crash the program or exhibit unintended behavior due to accessing invalid memory.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL check for the `info` pointer at the start of the function:

```c
static void spu_gov_cancel_work(struct spu_gov_info_struct *info)
{
    if (info == NULL)
        return;  // Exit early if `info` is NULL
    cancel_delayed_work_sync(&info->work);
}
```
