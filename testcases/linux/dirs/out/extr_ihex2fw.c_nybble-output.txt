UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. The operations are safe, as it performs arithmetic on valid range checks (`n >= '0' && n <= '9'`, etc.) and uses the subtraction operator correctly. The default case (return `0`) ensures no undefined behavior for out-of-range values.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function returns `0` for values `n` that are not in the expected sets ('0'-'9', 'A'-'F', 'a'-'f'). Returning `0` may lead to unintended results if the caller expects only valid hexadecimal values or does not check for out-of-range input. This is a hidden logic flaw that depends on how calling functions interpret the result.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Consider signaling the invalid input more explicitly, e.g., by returning an error code (-1) instead of `0`, or documenting clearly that any unexpected input will be mapped to `0`.
