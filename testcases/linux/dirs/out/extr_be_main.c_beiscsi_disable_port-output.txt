Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_be_main.c_beiscsi_disable_port.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The loop `for (i = 0; i < phba->num_cpus; i++)` runs and accesses `phwi_context->be_eq[i]`. However, on the last condition within the if block `if (!unload && beiscsi_hba_in_error(phba))`, there is an attempt to reassign `pbe_eq =&phwi_context->be_eq[i]` after the loop finishes where `i == phba->num_cpus`. This results in an out-of-bounds access to `phwi_context->be_eq` since the array index `phba->num_cpus` is beyond its valid range.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The variable `pbe_eq` is reassigned after the loop with an invalid index `i == phba->num_cpus`, causing out-of-bounds access on `phwi_context->be_eq`. This bug can manifest as invalid memory access or unpredictable behavior depending on how `phwi_context->be_eq` is allocated.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `i` is reset or clamped within the bounds of `phba->num_cpus` before reassigning `pbe_eq`. For example:
```c
if (!unload && beiscsi_hba_in_error(phba)) {
    if (phba->num_cpus > 0) {
        pbe_eq = &phwi_context->be_eq[phba->num_cpus - 1];
        cancel_work_sync(&pbe_eq->mcc_work);
    }
}
```
Alternatively, validate `phba->num_cpus` and enforce bounds before accessing the array.
