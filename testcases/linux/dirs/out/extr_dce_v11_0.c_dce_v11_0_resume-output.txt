UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior exists if `adev->mode_info.bl_encoder` is dereferenced when it is `NULL`. In the function, the code does not check explicitly for the validity of the pointer before using it in the call to `amdgpu_display_backlight_get_level` or `amdgpu_display_backlight_set_level`. Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: `adev->mode_info.bl_encoder` can be `NULL`, leading to a null pointer dereference when it is passed to functions `amdgpu_display_backlight_get_level` or `amdgpu_display_backlight_set_level`. Although the code has a conditional block `if (adev->mode_info.bl_encoder)` to check its existence, the dereference occurs in those functions, which might not handle `NULL` properly. This violates safe memory access principles.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add explicit validation for the `adev->mode_info.bl_encoder` pointer before its use in both associated function callsâ€”either within the caller or safely handle it inside the callee functions.
2. Ensure that `amdgpu_display_backlight_get_level` and `amdgpu_display_backlight_set_level` are robust against a possible `NULL` pointer. If the pointer is `NULL`, return early without attempting dereference.

Example fix:
```c
if (adev->mode_info.bl_encoder) {
    u8 bl_level = amdgpu_display_backlight_get_level(adev, adev->mode_info.bl_encoder);
    if (bl_level) {  // safeguard
        amdgpu_display_backlight_set_level(adev, adev->mode_info.bl_encoder, bl_level);
    }
}
```
Ensure the backend functions also contain null-pointer validation for robustness.
