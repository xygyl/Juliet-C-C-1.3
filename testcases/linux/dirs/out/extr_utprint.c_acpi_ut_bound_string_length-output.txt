UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not check whether `string` is NULL before dereferencing it. Dereferencing a NULL pointer results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: If `string` is passed as `NULL` to the function, the line `while (*string && count)` will dereference the NULL pointer, causing a runtime crash or undefined behavior.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a check for NULL pointer at the start of the function:
```c
if (!string) {
    return 0;
}
```
This ensures the function does not attempt to process a NULL pointer.
