Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vivid-cec.c_vivid_cec_alloc_adap.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `snprintf` function may compute a wrong limit for the buffer size when combining `sizeof(dev->vid_out_dev.name)` with a constant value (`+2`) for the buffer size. If `dev->vid_out_dev.name` or `dev->vid_cap_dev.name` is not null-terminated or its size misaligns with expectations, this could lead to undefined behavior such as buffer overflows.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer overflow
Bug Reason: The `snprintf` function uses `sizeof(dev->vid_out_dev.name)` directly without verifying the actual length of the `name` field. If this field is less than expected or improperly terminated, the buffer size passed to `snprintf` might be exceeded, leading to a buffer overflow.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Replace `sizeof(dev->vid_out_dev.name)` with the length of the string determined by `strlen` plus a constant buffer size for safety. Ensure `dev->vid_out_dev.name` and `dev->vid_cap_dev.name` are properly null-terminated. Pre-check the input lengths and adjust the buffer size dynamically if needed.
