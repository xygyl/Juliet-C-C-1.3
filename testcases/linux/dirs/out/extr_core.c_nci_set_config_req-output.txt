Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_core.c_nci_set_config_req.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The call to `memcpy(cmd.param.val, param->val, param->len)` assumes `param->val` and `cmd.param.val` point to valid memory regions of sufficient size for `param->len`. However, there is no check or guarantee provided in this function to ensure that `cmd.param.val` has enough allocated space to store `param->len` bytes, making this a potential out-of-bounds memory access, resulting in undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The lack of size validation for `cmd.param.val` prior to the call to `memcpy` can result in buffer overflow if `param->len` exceeds the size allocated for `cmd.param.val`. This can corrupt memory and cause crashes or security vulnerabilities.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before calling `memcpy`, ensure that `cmd.param.val` has been allocated or initialized with sufficient size to accommodate `param->len` bytes. Alternatively, enforce additional size checks to validate `param->len` against the allocated size of `cmd.param.val`. Additionally, document these constraints if they depend on external context such as protocol data structures.
