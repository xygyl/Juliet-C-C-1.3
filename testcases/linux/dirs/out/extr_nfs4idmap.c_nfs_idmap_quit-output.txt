Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nfs4idmap.c_nfs_idmap_quit.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences `id_resolver_cache` without checking if it is `NULL`. If `id_resolver_cache` is `NULL`, dereferencing it in `key_revoke(id_resolver_cache->thread_keyring)` would invoke undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The potential null pointer dereference of `id_resolver_cache`. If it is `NULL`, the function will attempt to access `id_resolver_cache->thread_keyring` and cause a runtime error. Additionally, passing a potential `NULL` pointer to `put_cred` might also lead to undesired behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of `nfs_idmap_quit` to ensure `id_resolver_cache` is not `NULL`:
```c
if (id_resolver_cache == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
