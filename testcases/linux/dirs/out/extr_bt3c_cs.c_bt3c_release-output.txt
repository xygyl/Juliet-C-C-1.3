UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Dereferencing `link->priv` (`info`) without checking if `link` is `NULL` is a form of undefined behavior. If `link` is `NULL`, attempting to access its `priv` field will result in an invalid memory access.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: Dereferencing `link->priv` assumes that `link` is a non-NULL pointer. However, there is no guarantee or check that `link` itself is valid, leading to a potential null pointer dereference.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `link` at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (link == NULL)
    return;
```
This ensures the function gracefully handles the case where `link` could be `NULL`.
