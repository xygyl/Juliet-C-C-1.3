Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_aacraid.h_cap_to_cyls.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `sector_div` macro modifies the input parameter `capacity` in-place. This can lead to undefined behavior if `capacity` is passed by value and reused (depending on the macro implementation). Furthermore, if `divisor` is 0, the division operation results in undefined behavior according to the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The behavior when the divisor is zero is not guarded against, which could lead to an invalid division operation and incorrect results or crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check before calling `sector_div` to ensure that `divisor` is not zero. Example:
```c
if (divisor == 0) {
    return 0; // Or handle the error appropriately, e.g., return an error code.
}
sector_div(capacity, divisor);
return capacity;
```
