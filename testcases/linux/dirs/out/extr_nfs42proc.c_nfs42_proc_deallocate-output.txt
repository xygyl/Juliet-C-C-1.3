### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason:  
There is no evidence of undefined behavior in this code snippet under standard C constraints. The function adheres to safe memory access patterns, ensures proper synchronization with `inode_lock` and `inode_unlock`, uses valid pointer dereferencing, and performs range checks and capability validation (`nfs_server_capable`) before invoking operations.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason:  
The `truncate_pagecache_range()` function call subtracts `1` from the range `(offset + len)` to determine the end of the range. However, this may lead to an off-by-one error, as the page cache truncation might not fully cover the intended range if the subtraction logic is incorrect. Specifically, if the intention is to truncate up to `offset + len`, the subtraction might inadvertently shrink the range by one unit. This subtle issue could lead to incomplete cache invalidation.

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion
Adjust the `truncate_pagecache_range()` call to ensure the range ends at the expected length. Replace:  
```c
truncate_pagecache_range(inode, offset, (offset + len) - 1);
```  
With:  
```c
truncate_pagecache_range(inode, offset, offset + len);
```  

This ensures the range of truncation explicitly includes all bytes up to `offset + len`.
