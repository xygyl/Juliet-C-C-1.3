Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mt9v111.c_mt9v111_enum_mbus_code.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing `mt9v111_formats[code->index].code` without ensuring that `code->index` is within valid bounds. Although there is a check for `code->index > ARRAY_SIZE(mt9v111_formats) - 1`, negative values of `code->index` are not validated. A negative index results in undefined behavior due to accessing memory out of bounds.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The function fails to validate `code->index` for negative values, which can lead to an invalid access resulting in crashes or unintended behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
- Add explicit validation for `code->index` to ensure it is non-negative.
```c
if (code->pad || code->index < 0 || code->index > ARRAY_SIZE(mt9v111_formats) - 1)
    return -EINVAL;
```
