UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential use of an uninitialized pointer or null dereference. The `dev_get_drvdata` function might return NULL, and the subsequent dereferencing via `fn(chg, val)` would lead to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not explicitly check if `chg` (retrieved via `dev_get_drvdata(dev)`) is NULL before dereferencing it in the call to `fn(chg, val)`. If `dev_get_drvdata()` returns NULL, this will result in undefined behavior at runtime and likely crash.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add a `NULL` check for `chg` after calling `dev_get_drvdata(dev)` to ensure it is valid before passing it to the `fn` function. Example:  

```c
chg = dev_get_drvdata(dev);
if (!chg)
    return -EINVAL; // Return an appropriate error code if `chg` is NULL.
```
