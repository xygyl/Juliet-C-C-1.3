### UB Analysis  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is potential undefined behavior due to a type punning violation. Specifically, `cur_offset`, which is a scalar type (`intptr_t` or similar), is being cast to `(u8 *)` and subtracted from another pointer (`u8 *fs`). This could violate strict aliasing rules, as `cur_offset` is not guaranteed to be an aligned address for `u8`. Additionally, it is unclear if `cur_offset` contains a valid pointer offset relative to the `fs` buffer, and subtracting or manipulating invalid pointers can result in undefined behavior.  

### Bug Analysis  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The subtraction operation `(u8 *)sgc->cur_offset - (u8 *)fs` fabricates an offset without verifying whether `cur_offset` points within the bounds of `fs_api_buffer`. If `cur_offset` is out of bounds or uninitialized, this leads to incorrect computation of the offset and potential memory corruption or access violations. Moreover, the computed `offset` can exceed the valid size of the `fs_api_buffer`, leading to an incorrect return value for the size.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:  
1. Validate `sgc->cur_offset` to ensure it points within the bounds of `fs_api_buffer` before performing operations with it.
2. Add checks to ensure `offset` is not exceeding the `fs_api_buffer_size`.
3. Replace `(u8 *)` type casting with safer and standard-compliant pointer arithmetic techniques.
