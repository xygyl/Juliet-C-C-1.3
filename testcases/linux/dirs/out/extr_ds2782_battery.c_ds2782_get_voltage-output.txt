UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow might occur in the expression `(raw / 32) * 4800`. If `raw` contains a sufficiently large positive value, dividing by `32` and then multiplying by `4800` can exceed the range of a signed integer, which is undefined behavior in C.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: The multiplication `(raw / 32) * 4800` may cause an integer overflow, possibly resulting in incorrect voltage calculation. This error could lead to erroneous behavior further down the program that uses `*voltage_uV`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use type `long` or `long long` for intermediate calculations in the expression `(raw / 32) * 4800` to handle larger values safely, e.g.:
```c
*voltage_uV = ((long)raw / 32) * 4800;
```
This avoids overflow even if `raw` is large while staying within the bounds of the correct datatype.
