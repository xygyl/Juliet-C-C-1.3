### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function refers to `stc_multipliers[idx]` without fully ensuring that `idx` is within the bounds of the `stc_multipliers` array. If `idx` exceeds the bounds of this array, this would result in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds memory access.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds read / logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function calculates `idx` based on the value of `frqcr`, but there's no verification that the resulting index `idx` is a valid index within the bounds of the `stc_multipliers` array. If the expected hardware logic fails or the array is improperly configured, accessing an invalid index could result in corrupted results or a crash due to reading invalid memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add explicit bounds checking for `idx` before accessing `stc_multipliers[idx]`. For example:
```c
if (idx < 0 || idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(stc_multipliers)) {
    // Handle error appropriately
}
```
