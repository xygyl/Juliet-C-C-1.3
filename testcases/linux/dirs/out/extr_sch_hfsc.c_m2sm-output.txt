Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sch_hfsc.c_m2sm.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `do_div()` macro is used for 64-bit division in kernel code, but it modifies its first argument. If `PSCHED_TICKS_PER_SEC` is zero, this division triggers undefined behavior (division by zero), which is not allowed by the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Bug
Bug Reason: There is no check to ensure that `PSCHED_TICKS_PER_SEC` is non-zero before performing the division. If this value were zero, the computation would fail due to division by zero, resulting in incorrect program behavior or a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check before the division to validate that `PSCHED_TICKS_PER_SEC` is greater than zero. For example:
```c
if (PSCHED_TICKS_PER_SEC == 0)
    return 0; // Or gracefully handle the error condition
do_div(sm, PSCHED_TICKS_PER_SEC);
```
