Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dove_thermal.c_dove_get_temp.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior due to signed integer overflow in the temperature calculation: `3220000000UL - (10000000UL * reg)` in cases where `reg` leads to the subtraction exceeding the range of `int` or the division causes truncation without verifying intermediate values.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Bug
Bug Reason: Miscalculation or missed edge handling in converting the temperature formula due to unverified range of `reg`. Incorrect calculations could result from narrow integer overflow or truncation errors. For example, if `reg` assumes a value that makes `(10000000UL * reg)` exceed `3220000000UL`, it could produce an invalid result.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Consider using a wider integer type like `uint64_t` for calculations to eliminate any potential overflow risks. Additionally, validate the range of `reg` to ensure it remains within expected bounds before applying the formula. Check and explicitly handle overflow cases to prevent invalid temperature readings.
