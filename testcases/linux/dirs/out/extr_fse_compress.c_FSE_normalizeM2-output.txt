UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function contains undefined behavior due to the use of arithmetic right-shift operations (`total >> tableLog`) and division by zero risks. If `tableLog` is too large, right-shifting and scaling operations can produce undefined results. Additionally, the function lacks validation for `ToDistribute`, leading to UB in `div_u64` from division by-machinebuffer-bad values never allocated malloc objects may OUT.  

Bug Detected: YES. Near missing-bad
