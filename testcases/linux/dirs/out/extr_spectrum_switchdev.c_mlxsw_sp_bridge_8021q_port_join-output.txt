UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: 
Dereferencing the `default_vlan` member of `mlxsw_sp_port` without verifying if `mlxsw_sp_port` and `default_vlan` are non-null could lead to undefined behavior. If `mlxsw_sp_port->default_vlan->fid` is accessed when either `mlxsw_sp_port` or `default_vlan` is NULL, it will lead to UB due to null pointer dereference.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason:
The code assumes that `mlxsw_sp_port->default_vlan` is always valid and does not null-check this pointer before accessing the `fid` member. If this assumption is incorrect in practice, it would result in a null pointer dereference.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
Add a null-check for `mlxsw_sp_port` and `mlxsw_sp_port->default_vlan` before accessing `mlxsw_sp_port->default_vlan->fid`:
```c
if (mlxsw_sp_port && mlxsw_sp_port->default_vlan && mlxsw_sp_port->default_vlan->fid)
    mlxsw_sp_port_vlan_router_leave(mlxsw_sp_port->default_vlan);
```

This will prevent null pointer dereferences and handle invalid input safely.
