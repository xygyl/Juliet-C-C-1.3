Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nfs3xdr.c_encode_entry_baggage.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds write when `xdr_encode_array` or `xdr_encode_hyper` miscalculate or exceed allocated buffer limits for `p`. No bound checking of `p` or allocated memory is done; memory overwrite is possible.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer overflow
Bug Reason: If the buffer `p` does not have sufficient space to accommodate the data written by `xdr_encode_array` or `xdr_encode_hyper`, a buffer overflow may occur. This can corrupt adjacent memory or cause unpredictable program behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Implement bounds checking before modifying the `p` pointer in calls to `xdr_encode_array` and `xdr_encode_hyper`. Ensure the buffer size allocated to `p` is controlled and explicitly verified.
