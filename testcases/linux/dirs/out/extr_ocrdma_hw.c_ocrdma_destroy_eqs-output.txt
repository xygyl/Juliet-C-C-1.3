### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function iterates through the eq_tbl array of a `struct ocrdma_dev` object and applies `ocrdma_destroy_eq` for each entry. The code does not contain any operations that are inherently undefined as per the C standard (e.g., no signed integer overflow, no null pointer dereference assuming `dev` and `dev->eq_tbl` are valid, no out-of-bounds access). The loop only accesses entries within the range [0, dev->eq_cnt), which is valid as long as `dev->eq_tbl` is properly initialized and large enough to accommodate `dev->eq_cnt` elements.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw or potential null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not check whether `dev` or `dev->eq_tbl` are null before use. If `dev` or `dev->eq_tbl` is NULL when `ocrdma_destroy_eqs` is called, it will lead to undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference. This is a common logical oversight that could lead to a crash, especially in kernel code where pointers are often dynamically allocated and passed around.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Add null pointer checks for `dev` and `dev->eq_tbl` before proceeding with the loop:  
```c
static void ocrdma_destroy_eqs(struct ocrdma_dev *dev)
{
    int i;

    if (dev == NULL || dev->eq_tbl == NULL)
        return;  // Avoid null pointer dereference

    for (i = 0; i < dev->eq_cnt; i++)
        ocrdma_destroy_eq(dev, &dev->eq_tbl[i]);
}
```  
This ensures that the function gracefully handles the scenario where the inputs are null, preventing potential crashes or undefined behavior.
