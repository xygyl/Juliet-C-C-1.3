UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function simply returns the value of the integer variable `available_pres`, and there is no operation or construct in the code that is associated with undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function relies on the global variable `available_pres`, but it does not perform any checks to ensure that `available_pres` has been initialized or has a valid value. If `available_pres` is used uninitialized or corrupted (e.g., modified unexpectedly in another part of the program), the result of this function may be unpredictable or invalid. This is a potential bug that could lead to problematic behavior depending on how `available_pres` is managed.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `available_pres` is properly initialized before this function is called. If `available_pres` is altered dynamically elsewhere, consider adding sanity checks within the function to validate its value (e.g., ensuring it falls within a specific range of acceptable values).
