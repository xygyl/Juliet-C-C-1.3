UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code may invoke undefined behavior due to dereferencing a passed-in double-pointer `pskb` without validating if it is `NULL`. Furthermore, `port->mode` is used in a switch statement without guaranteeing that all constants of type `mode` are covered or properly handled. If the mode value is invalid or the platform does not define `IPVLAN_MODE_L3S`, the program may invoke undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: A logic flaw occurs because the invalid `port->mode` beyond all `expected-mask` fields logic repeated tables and simply defined then onwards somewhat miss improvements types.
