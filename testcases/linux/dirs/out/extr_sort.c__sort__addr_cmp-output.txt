Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sort.c__sort__addr_cmp.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The subtraction `(right_ip - left_ip)` may result in signed integer overflow if `right_ip` is larger than `left_ip` and the difference exceeds the range that a signed `int64_t` can hold. According to the C standard, signed integer overflow leads to undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: The cast `(int64_t)(right_ip - left_ip)` assumes the result fits in the range of `int64_t`. If the difference between `right_ip` and `left_ip` exceeds the range of a signed 64-bit integer, it could store a wrong value or lead to undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Change the return type to `int64_t` and use proper range checks or unsigned arithmetic. Consider rewriting the function as:

```c
static int64_t _sort__addr_cmp(u64 left_ip, u64 right_ip)
{
    if (right_ip > left_ip)
        return (int64_t)(right_ip - left_ip);
    else
        return (int64_t)(left_ip - right_ip);
}
```

Or, use unsigned arithmetic for intermediate computation and return a signed result carefully.
