UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Out-of-bounds memory access. The `kzalloc()` allocation size is based on 7 entries, but the code writes 8 entries (index 0 to 7) into `table_clk_vlt->entries`, exceeding the allocated size.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: Incorrect allocation size calculation leads to an out-of-bounds write, corrupting adjacent memory or causing a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Change the allocation size in `kzalloc()` to accommodate 8 entries instead of 7 by passing `struct_size(table_clk_vlt, entries, 8)` instead of `struct_size(table_clk_vlt, entries, 7)`.
