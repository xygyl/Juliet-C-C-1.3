UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow may occur in the arithmetic calculation `prod - cons[i]` and `tmp - cons[i]`. `cons[i]` and `prod` are of type `u32` (unsigned 32-bit integer), and when these values are cast to signed integers (if scalar_t__ defaults to signed types), subtraction can result in undefined behavior due to signed overflow.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer underflow/overflow
Bug Reason: The subtraction in `prod - cons[i]` and `tmp - cons[i]` does not account for the possibility of unsigned integer underflow/overflow. If `prod` is smaller than `cons[i]`, the subtraction wraps around, leading to invalid `distance[i]` values or incorrect logic during `distance[i] > tmp - cons[i]`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure the arithmetic operations explicitly account for unsigned wraparound. Replace the subtraction in `distance[i] = prod - cons[i]` and `tmp - cons[i]` with a logic that prevents erroneous values, e.g., `distance[i] = (prod >= cons[i]) ? (prod - cons[i]) : 0` to prevent underflow. Alternatively, use a suitable type for the mathematical operation that does not risk UB when converting to signed types.
