UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds access to `cont_map[cont]` due to absence of bounds checking on `cont`. If `cont` is negative or exceeds the valid range of `cont_map`, undefined behavior occurs since accessing an array out of its bounds is undefined behavior in C. Additionally, `cont_map` is treated as an external variable without any initialization or definition in the provided context. If `cont_map` is NULL or invalid, dereferencing it leads to UB.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Access  
Bug Reason: Same as UB: `cont_map[cont]` may result in an out-of-bounds access. Furthermore, the value of `pi->mode` is not validated before being used as a switch case, and invalid values may bypass all the cases, resulting in no operation performedâ€”this could potentially be unintended behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Perform bounds checking on `cont` before accessing `cont_map`. Validate that `cont_map` is properly initialized and points to valid memory. Confirm `pi->mode` has permissible values before entering the switch statement. Ensure proper handling of unexpected values in the switch cases by adding a `default` case.
