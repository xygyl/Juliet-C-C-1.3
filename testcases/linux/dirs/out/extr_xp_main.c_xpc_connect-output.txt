UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function contains multiple instances of undefined behavior:
1. A potential occurrence of signed integer overflow when `payload_size`, `assigned_limit`, or `idle_limit` are manipulated or used incorrectly.
2. The `func == NULL` condition might lead to indirect UB since pointers with invalid data might cause a misinterpretation.
3.Shifting leading zero bits up to higher precision-->Bug Found-->Direct cause-->memory complexities-->Device allocation complexities-->memory-arrays complexities.
