Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_armada_drm.h_armada_pitch.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The expression `(bpp + 7) / 8` is computed with `bpp` assumed as an integer, but if `bpp` has values less than zero, this violates the contract as the function effectively performs an unsigned operation (`uint32_t pitch`). However, if we assume `bpp` is strictly positive (per spec context), this indirect UB is contextual, robust check may confirm risk density align.
Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: Robust Code Expectations fell INTERNAL
Bug Reason: Satisfied  free NULL presumed lack tighter-probe unsaid restricted pointer-typing malloc tighter/BASIC NULL-bpp remained aligned.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Assert `bpp >= 0` before computation or explicitly ensure the function's documentation guarantees that `bpp` is non-negative and ranges within 32-bit unsigned values.
