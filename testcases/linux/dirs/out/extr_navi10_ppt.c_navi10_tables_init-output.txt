### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit any operations explicitly causing undefined behavior as per the C standard. It initializes a set of tables using the macro `SMU_TABLE_INIT` and allocates memory safely using `kzalloc`. There are no signs of signed integer overflow, null pointer dereference (since kzalloc is checked), uninitialized variable usage, or other UB-causing constructs.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Leak  
Bug Reason: The function dynamically allocates memory for `smu_table->metrics_table` using `kzalloc`, but there is no cleanup logic for this memory if the function is called repeatedly or if `smu_context` is later freed. This may lead to a memory leak.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the allocated memory for `smu_table->metrics_table` is freed explicitly when it is no longer needed, such as during the shutdown or cleanup of the SMU context.
