UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow can occur as `--idx` decrements `idx` below 0 in the `while (--idx > 1)` loop. The standard does not define the behavior of signed integer overflow.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The `while (--idx > 1)` loop may cause `idx` to reach negative values, potentially leading to memory access out of bounds when accessing `data[idx]`. This is a logical error that can lead to buffer underflow or undefined behavior depending on the memory layout.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Change the `while (--idx > 1)` condition to avoid decrementing `idx` below 0 by explicitly adding a boundary check, e.g., `while (idx > 1 && --idx >= 0)`. Alternatively, rewrite the loop to ensure `idx` stays within valid bounds throughout its execution.
