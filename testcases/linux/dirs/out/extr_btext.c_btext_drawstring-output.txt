UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: No null pointer validation is performed on the input parameter `c`. If `c` is passed as `NULL`, dereferencing `*c` in the `while (*c)` loop leads to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `c` is `NULL`, dereferencing it results in a crash, since the `while (*c)` condition assumes `c` points to valid memory.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `c` at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (c == NULL)
    return;
```
This ensures the function exits gracefully when a null pointer is encountered.
