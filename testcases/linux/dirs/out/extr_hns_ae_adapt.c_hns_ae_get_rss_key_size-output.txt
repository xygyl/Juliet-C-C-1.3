Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hns_ae_adapt.c_hns_ae_get_rss_key_size.c

UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function does not perform any operations that involve undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. It simply returns a predefined constant value (`HNS_PPEV2_RSS_KEY_SIZE`) without performing any computation or dereferencing pointers.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The `handle` parameter is unused in the function implementation. Although this does not lead to memory or runtime issues, it could be considered a design bug or a potential issue if the function is meant to utilize the `handle` to determine the RSS key size dynamically. This unused parameter could lead to confusion and maintenance challenges if leftover from previous or planned functionality.

Bug Caused by UB: No

Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: If the `handle` parameter is not intended to be used, it should be removed from the function prototype to ensure clarity and maintain cleaner code. If it is intended for future functionality, consider adding comments explaining its inclusion or implement the behavior that utilizes `handle`.
