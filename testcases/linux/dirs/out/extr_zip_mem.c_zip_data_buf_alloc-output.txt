### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The call to `__get_free_pages` uses `get_order(size)`, where `size` is a `u64`. If `size` exceeds the limits that can be properly represented by `get_order` (which expects a size representable in terms of powers of two for page allocation), it may cause undefined behavior. In addition, the `memset` call uses `size`, but the allocation from `__get_free_pages` might not align correctly with the `size` value, potentially leading to a memory overrun during the `memset`.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overrun, Logical Flaw  
Bug Reason: 
1. If `__get_free_pages` fails to allocate the requested `size` (e.g., the allocation granularity differs from `size` due to `get_order(size)`), `memset(ptr, 0, size)` will potentially overrun the allocated memory.
2. There is no verification that the `size` argument is valid or can be handled correctly by `get_order`. If `size` is overly large, the allocation will fail silently, causing logical flaws in subsequent code paths.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes

### Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Add validation for `size` to ensure it is within a reasonable range for `get_order` and memory allocation.
   ```c
   if (size == 0 || size > MAX_ALLOWED_SIZE) {
       zip_dbg("Invalid size for allocation");
       return NULL;
   }
   ```
   Replace `MAX_ALLOWED_SIZE` with the actual limit based on platform constraints.

2. Modify `__get_free_pages` to ensure the allocated size and `size` match correctly. For example, check the alignment:
   ```c
   if (ptr && size > (PAGE_SIZE << get_order(size))) {
       free_pages((unsigned long)ptr, get_order(size));
       zip_dbg("Allocation size mismatch");
       return NULL;
   }
   ```

3. Use safer memory initialization. Avoid `memset` on unverified memory allocations.
