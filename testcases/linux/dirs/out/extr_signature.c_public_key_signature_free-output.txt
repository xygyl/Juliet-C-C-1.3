Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_signature.c_public_key_signature_free.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential null pointer dereference when accessing `sig->auth_ids` inside the loop without verifying if `sig->auth_ids` is non-NULL. If `sig->auth_ids` is NULL, dereferencing it leads to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: Dereferencing `sig->auth_ids[i]` without verifying if `auth_ids` is NULL could cause a crash. Additionally, there isn't any verification of array bounds to ensure that the size of `auth_ids` matches `ARRAY_SIZE(sig->auth_ids)`, though this would likely have been enforced elsewhere.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `sig->auth_ids` is non-NULL before accessing its elements. Example:
```c
if (sig->auth_ids) {
    for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(sig->auth_ids); i++) {
        kfree(sig->auth_ids[i]);
    }
}
```
