UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `etm->synth_opts.last_branch_sz` has an extremely large value, the computation of `sz` will overflow, resulting in undefined behavior according to the C standard. Signed integer overflow is undefined in C. Additionally, `malloc` and `zalloc` don't explicitly check for overflows in this context.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Allocation Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: Large values of `etm->synth_opts.last_branch_sz` can lead to incorrect allocation sizes through integer overflow in `sz`, causing insufficient or invalid memory allocation. This may lead to buffer overflows or crashes during use of these buffers (`tidq->last_branch` and `tidq->last_branch_rb`).
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Introduce checks to validate the value of `etm->synth_opts.last_branch_sz`. For example:
```c
if (etm->synth_opts.last_branch_sz > MAX_BRANCH_SZ)  // Define an appropriate upper bound
    goto out;
```
Additionally, validate `sz` before proceeding with allocation:
```c
size_t sz = sizeof(struct branch_stack) + etm->synth_opts.last_branch_sz * sizeof(struct branch_entry);
if (sz < sizeof(struct branch_stack) || etm->synth_opts.last_branch_sz > (SIZE_MAX - sizeof(struct branch_stack)) / sizeof(struct branch_entry))  // Prevent overflow
    goto out;
```
