### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The pointer `pi` is assigned the result of the function `rv770_get_pi(rdev)`. If `rv770_get_pi(rdev)` returns `NULL`, dereferencing `pi->boot_in_gen2` leads to undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference. Additionally, type `udelay`, called with the argument `10`, is not guaranteed to specify that the delay is within specification, as its exact resolution may depend on platform and configuration.
