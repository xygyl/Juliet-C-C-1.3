UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function assumes that `a1` and `a2` are valid pointers and dereferences them without checking for `NULL`. If either `a1` or `a2` is `NULL`, dereferencing them causes undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: Due to the lack of `NULL` checks, null pointer dereference is possible if either of the input pointers (`a1` or `a2`) is `NULL`. This leads to runtime crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to ensure both `a1` and `a2` are non-`NULL` at the start of the function:
```c
if (a1 == NULL || a2 == NULL)
    return false;
```
