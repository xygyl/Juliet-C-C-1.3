Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_emu8000.c_send_array.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `send_array` function increments `p` four times, but does not reset it after each loop. This results in out-of-bounds memory access when accessing `*p` during the second, third, and fourth loops. Out-of-bounds memory access is undefined behavior in C.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: Since the `p` pointer is incremented without being reset after each loop, `EMU8000_INIT2_WRITE`, `EMU8000_INIT3_WRITE`, and `EMU8000_INIT4_WRITE` will attempt to write beyond the bounds of the `data` buffer. This is a logic flaw that leads to memory corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Reset the `p` pointer to `data` at the start of each loop:  
```c
    p = data;  
    for (i = 0; i < size; i++, p++)  
        EMU8000_INIT1_WRITE(emu, i, *p);  

    p = data;  
    for (i = 0; i < size; i++, p++)  
        EMU8000_INIT2_WRITE(emu, i, *p);  

    p = data;  
    for (i = 0; i < size; i++, p++)  
        EMU8000_INIT3_WRITE(emu, i, *p);  

    p = data;  
    for (i = 0; i < size; i++, p++)  
        EMU8000_INIT4_WRITE(emu, i, *p);  
```  

This fix ensures that `p` points to the start of the `data` array for each loop, preventing any out-of-bounds access.
