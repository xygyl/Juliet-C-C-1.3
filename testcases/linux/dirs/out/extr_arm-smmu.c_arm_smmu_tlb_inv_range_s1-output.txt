UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `size -= granule` operation occurs in a `do-while` loop without a proper safeguard against underflow. If `granule` is greater than `size`, this results in `size` becoming a very large positive value due to unsigned integer wrapping. This can lead to undefined behavior in subsequent iterations and memory access. Additionally, `granule >> 12` in the ARM_SMMU_CTX_FMT_AARCH64 branch may result in a shift greater than the type width if `granule` is too small, causing undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer underflow  
Bug Reason: The `size -= granule` logic assumes that `size` will remain non-negative (or non-zero in unsigned terms) but does not account for cases where `granule` exceeds `size`. This can cause the loop to behave erratically or iterate indefinitely. Furthermore, potential shift issues in `granule >> 12` may crash the program for invalid inputs.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add defensive checks to prevent the underflow issue in the loop condition. For instance, replace `size -= granule` with `if (size < granule) break; size -= granule`. Also, ensure `granule >> 12` is only calculated when `granule >= 4096` (i.e., `granule >= (1 << 12)`) to prevent undefined behavior during bit shifts.
