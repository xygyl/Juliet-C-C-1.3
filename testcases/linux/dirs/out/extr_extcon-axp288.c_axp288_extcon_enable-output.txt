UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function accesses `info->regmap` without any null check for the `info` pointer. If `info` is passed as `NULL`, dereferencing `info->regmap` results in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The same issue detected as undefined behavior could lead to a crash. If `info` is `NULL`, the program attempts to dereference it to access `info->regmap`, resulting in a null pointer dereference bug.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check at the beginning of the function to validate the `info` structure is not `NULL`. For example:
```c
if (!info) {
    return;
}
```
