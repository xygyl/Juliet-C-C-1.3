Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_me-debugfs.c_adjust_instruction_counter_name.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `adjust_instruction_counter_name` function has the potential for undefined behavior due to a `strcpy` call. The `strcpy` function does not perform bounds checking and assumes that `out_name` has enough allocated memory to hold the contents of `in_name`. If `in_name` is longer than the allocated space for `out_name`, it will cause a buffer overflow, leading to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The same reason as UB; `strcpy` does not check the size of the destination buffer (`out_name`). If `in_name` is longer than the allocated memory for `out_name`, it will write out of bounds, corrupting memory and potentially crashing the program or causing security vulnerabilities.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Use `strncpy` or a safer alternative such as `snprintf`, ensuring that the content copied to `out_name` does not exceed its allocated size. E.g., replace `strcpy(out_name, in_name);` with `strncpy(out_name, in_name, max_size - 1); out_name[max_size - 1] = '\0';`, where `max_size` is the size of `out_name`. Add validation to ensure that `out_name` has enough space for the operation.
