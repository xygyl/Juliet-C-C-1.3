### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function assumes that the pointers `val` and `val2` are valid and directly dereferences them without checking for `NULL`. If either `val` or `val2` is `NULL`, dereferencing them would result in undefined behavior.
 
### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If the caller passes a `NULL` pointer for either `val` or `val2`, the function will dereference these pointers, causing a crash or undefined behavior. There is no validation to ensure that these pointers are non-`NULL` before dereferencing them. The bug is directly caused by the undefined behavior described above.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

### Confidence: High
The issues described are clearly identifiable from the code. If `NULL` pointers are passed for `val` or `val2`, the function will crash.

### Fix Suggestion:
Add checks to validate that `val` and `val2` are non-`NULL` before dereferencing them. For example:
```c
if (!val || !val2)
    return -EINVAL;
```
This ensures that the function will safely return an error code if invalid pointers are provided, preventing undefined behavior and potential crashes.
