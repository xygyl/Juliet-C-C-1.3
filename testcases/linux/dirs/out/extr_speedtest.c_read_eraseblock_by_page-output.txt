UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Pointer arithmetic on `void *` is undefined behavior in C. The `buf` pointer (of type `void *`) is incremented with `buf += pgsize;`. The C standard does not define pointer arithmetic for pointers of type `void *`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Undefined Behavior  
Bug Reason: Undefined behavior caused by `void *` pointer arithmetic may lead to incorrect behavior, crashes, or portability issues. Additionally, if `pgsize` or `addr` calculations are incorrect, this could lead to another potential issue such as out-of-bounds memory access.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
Change the type of `buf` to `char *` or another specific type (e.g., `uint8_t *`) to ensure defined pointer arithmetic. For example:  
```c
char *buf = (char *)iobuf;
```  
This will make `buf += pgsize;` valid and well-defined.
