UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The pointer `num` is dereferenced without checking if it is null. If `num` were to be a null pointer, dereferencing it in `htonl(*num)` or `ntohl(*num)` would result in undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The use of an unchecked pointer `num` could lead to a null pointer dereference if the caller of the function passes `NULL`. This would cause undefined behavior and likely crash the program. 
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check before dereferencing `num`. For example:
```c
if (num == NULL) {
    // Handle error appropriately, e.g., log an error and return
    return;
}
```
