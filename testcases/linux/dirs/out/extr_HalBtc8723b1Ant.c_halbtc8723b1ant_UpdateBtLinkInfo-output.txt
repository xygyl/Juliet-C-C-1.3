### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain operations that could lead to undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. All pointer dereferences appear valid, no memory is accessed out of bounds, and no arithmetic operations (e.g., signed integer overflow) are performed. Function arguments and members of structures are accessed in a safe manner, respecting their data types and initialization conditions.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential Memory-related Bug  
Bug Reason: The global variable `pCoexSta` is dereferenced to access members (`bBtLinkExist`, `bScoExist`, etc.), but there is no validation to ensure `pCoexSta` is non-NULL before dereferencing it. If `pCoexSta` is NULL, this would lead to undefined behavior, specifically a null pointer dereference.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Add a validation check for `pCoexSta` before dereferencing it in the function:
```c
if (pCoexSta == NULL) {
    return; // or handle the case appropriately
}
```
This resolves the null pointer dereference issue and ensures safer code execution.
