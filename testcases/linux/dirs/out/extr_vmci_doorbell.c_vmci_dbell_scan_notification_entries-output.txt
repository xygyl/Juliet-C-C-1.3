UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not check for valid `bitmap` pointer before accessing its elements. If `bitmap` is `NULL`, dereferencing it (`bitmap[idx]`) results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes the `bitmap` pointer is valid but does not validate it. If the caller passes a `NULL` pointer, the dereferencing of `bitmap[idx]` will lead to a crash or undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add a `NULL` check for the `bitmap` pointer at the beginning of the function:  
```c
if (!bitmap) {
    return;
}
```  
This ensures the function does not proceed with accessing memory based on an invalid pointer.
