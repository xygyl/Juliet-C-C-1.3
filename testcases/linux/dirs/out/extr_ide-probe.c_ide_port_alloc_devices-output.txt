Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_ide-probe.c_ide_port_alloc_devices.c

UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The code does not appear to invoke undefined behavior as per the C-standard. Memory allocation is performed using `kzalloc_node`, and its failure cases are properly handled (checked for `NULL`). The pointer `hwif->devices[i]` is properly updated only when allocations succeed.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Leak  
Bug Reason: If the allocation of `drive->id` fails (`kzalloc_node(SECTOR_SIZE, GFP_KERNEL, node)` returning `NULL`), the function ends at the `goto out_free_drive` label. While the `drive` object itself is freed using `kfree(drive)`, the loop's previously allocated `hwif->devices` objects are not freed, leading to a memory leak.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Modify the `goto out_nomem` branch to ensure all previously allocated `hwif->devices` objects are explicitly deallocated before returning. For example:

```c
out_free_drive:
	kfree(drive);

out_nomem:
	for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {  // Free any previously allocated devices
		kfree(hwif->devices[j]->id);
		kfree(hwif->devices[j]);
	}
	ide_port_free_devices(hwif);
	return -ENOMEM;
```
