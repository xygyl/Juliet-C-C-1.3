Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_eeprom_4k.c_ath9k_hw_4k_get_spur_channel.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code does not validate the array index `i` when accessing `spurChans[i]`. If the `i` parameter exceeds the bounds of the `spurChans` array, this results in an out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior according to the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access
Bug Reason: Without validating `i`, the function risks accessing memory outside the bounds of the `spurChans` array, potentially leading to memory corruption or program crashes.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check for the index `i` to ensure it does not exceed the size of the `spurChans` array before accessing it. For example:
```c
if (i >= SPUR_CHANS_SIZE) {
    // Handle error, e.g., return an error code or assert
}
```
Where `SPUR_CHANS_SIZE` is the defined size of the `spurChans` array.
