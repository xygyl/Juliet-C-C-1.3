UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
- Accessing `pix_mp->plane_fmt[i]` could lead to undefined behavior if `pix_mp->num_planes` is larger than the array size allocated for `plane_fmt`. This can cause out-of-bounds access since there's no guarantee that `plane_fmt` has enough elements for the loop condition `i < pix_mp->num_planes`.  
- Additionally, `(frame->fmt->depth[i])` accesses an array index without proper bounds checking; if `frame->fmt->depth` does not contain enough elements, this leads to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Access  
Bug Reason:  
- The loop `for (i = 0; i < pix_mp->num_planes; ++i)` assumes that both `frame->fmt->depth` and `pix_mp->plane_fmt` arrays have a valid size corresponding to `num_planes`. If the array sizes are insufficient or misconfigured, the loop may cause memory corruption or segmentation faults.  
- It is not checked whether `ctx_get_frame()` returns a valid frame with properly initialized members like `fmt`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: Medium  

Fix Suggestion:  
- Add bounds checks to ensure the size of the `plane_fmt` and `depth` arrays is at least as large as `num_planes`. For example:
```c
if (pix_mp->num_planes > MAX_PLANES || frame->fmt->num_planes > MAX_PLANES) {
    return -EINVAL; // Invalid number of planes
}
```
- Verify `ctx_get_frame()` returns a valid non-NULL frame before further processing.  
- Use safer conditional logic to expose potential allocation mismatches explicitly.
