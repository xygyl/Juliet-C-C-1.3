UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential dereference of an invalid pointer. The function `i915_gem_object_get_stride(obj)` and `i915_gem_object_get_tile_height(obj)` are called on `obj`, but there is no nullity check or validation for the object pointer `obj`. If `obj` is null, undefined behavior occurs due to dereferencing a null pointer.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw or null pointer dereference.
Bug Reason: The logic assumes `obj` is always valid. If `obj` is null, the function will result in a crash or undefined behavior due to invalid pointer access.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `obj` before passing it to the functions. For example:
```c
if (obj == NULL)
    return 0; // Or an appropriate default error value
```

Alternatively, ensure `obj` is guaranteed to be non-null wherever this function is used.
