Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hdmi.c_tegra_hdmi_setup_avi_infoframe.c
UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit any undefined behavior based on the C standard. The code uses `ssize_t` for error checking and handles potential errors gracefully (e.g., ensuring negative values from `drm_hdmi_avi_infoframe_from_display_mode` or `hdmi_avi_infoframe_pack` will result in early exits). There is no evidence of signed integer overflow, null pointer dereference, uninitialized variables, or out-of-bounds array accesses.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Bug
Bug Reason: The `tegra_hdmi_write_infopack` function is called with the variable `err` as the size of the `buffer`. However, the `err` variable represents the result of `hdmi_avi_infoframe_pack`, which might return a negative value upon error or a size that exceeds the allocated `buffer`. If the error-checking logic fails to capture negative values or excessive sizes, it could potentially lead to a logic flaw or memory corruption when handling buffer contents in `tegra_hdmi_write_infopack`.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate the success of `hdmi_avi_infoframe_pack` explicitly before invoking `tegra_hdmi_write_infopack`, ensuring `err` is a positive value that does not exceed the size of `buffer`. For example:

```c
if (err > 0 && err <= sizeof(buffer)) {
    tegra_hdmi_write_infopack(hdmi, buffer, err);
} else {
    dev_err(hdmi->dev, "invalid AVI infoframe size: %zd\n", err);
}
```
