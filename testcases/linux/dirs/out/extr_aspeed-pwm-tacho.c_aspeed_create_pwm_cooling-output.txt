UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: 
1. The use of `snprintf(cdev->name, MAX_CDEV_NAME_LEN, "%pOFn%d", child, pwm_port)` assumes that the `child` object represents a valid pointer and `%pOFn` is correctly interpreted. However, `%pOFn` format specifier is kernel-specific, and its usage depends on the appropriate formatting being supported for device node objects (`struct device_node`). If the macro `%pOFn` is incorrectly used or `child` is invalid, this could lead to undefined behavior. 

2. Additionally, there is a possible integer truncation issue in `num_levels - 1`. If `num_levels - 1` results in a negative value and the underlying type of `max_state` is unsigned, this operation would have undefined behavior (e.g., wraparound in unsigned values and signed conversions).

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Possible NULL pointer dereference and logic flaw  
Bug Reason: 
1. If `of_property_read_u8_array(child, "cooling-levels", cdev->cooling_levels, num_levels)` fails, it does not validate whether the `cdev->cooling_levels` buffer contains garbage or valid data; the code proceeds with `snprintf` after encountering an error, potentially referencing invalid memory.

2. There is no validation for `num_levels`. If `num_levels == 0` or an extremely large value is passed, this causes a problematic allocation (`devm_kzalloc(dev, num_levels, GFP_KERNEL)`), leading to potential out-of-memory or illogical behavior.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Ensure `%pOFn` is supported and correctly used for the specific kernel configuration, or use a safer approach to format device node names. Validate the `child` pointer before using it with `%pOFn`.
2. Validate `num_levels`. Check for valid (non-zero, reasonable) values of `num_levels` before proceeding with the calculations and memory allocations.
3. After `of_property_read_u8_array` fails, add a cleanup mechanism or handle the error more robustly instead of assuming `cdev->cooling_levels` has meaningful data.
