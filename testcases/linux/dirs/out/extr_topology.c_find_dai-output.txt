### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Dereferencing a null pointer in `strcmp`**: The `name` argument is passed into `strcmp` without validation. If `name` is `NULL`, calling `strcmp(NULL, sof_dais[i].name)` results in undefined behavior because `strcmp` requires valid pointers for both of its arguments.
2. **Invalid array index access in `sof_dais[i]`**: While not explicitly UB here, the `ARRAY_SIZE` macro can lead to undefined behavior if `sof_dais` is improperly defined or its size is zero (e.g., an empty array structure). Assuming `sof_dais` is correctly set up, this is unlikely but should be validated during runtime.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: Passing a potentially null `name` into `strcmp` leads to runtime failure. There is no check for `name == NULL` before using it. Additionally, if `sof_dais` is improperly defined, the loop may iterate over an invalid structure causing unpredictable behavior, although this is unlikely if the code is correctly written elsewhere.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Add a check for `name == NULL` before executing the loop. For example:
```c
if (!name)
    return SOF_DAI_INTEL_NONE;

for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(sof_dais); i++) {
    if (strcmp(name, sof_dais[i].name) == 0)
        return sof_dais[i].type;
}
return SOF_DAI_INTEL_NONE;
```  
Additionally, verify `sof_dais` structure is properly initialized and `ARRAY_SIZE` is meaningful in the context where this function is invoked.
