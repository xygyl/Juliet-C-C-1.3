UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The macro `G_SCD_BERR_TID(status)` is used directly as part of arithmetic and bitwise operations, but its definition is not provided in the code. If it results in behavior such as unaligned access or undefined shifting, UB may occur. Additionally, if `G_SCD_BERR_RID(status)` or `G_SCD_BERR_DCODE(status)` cause unaligned pointers or involve pointers manipulated as scalars incorrectly, UB may arise. The function assumes these macros expand safely, which cannot be verified from the provided code.  

Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: N/A  
Bug Reason: No evident logical bugs, buffer overflows, memory issues, or arithmetic problems are visible within the function. The function does not dereference pointers nor use complex expressions that suggest invalid memory access. It safely outputs data using `printk`.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure the definitions of macros `G_SCD_BERR_TID`, `G_SCD_BERR_RID`, and `G_SCD_BERR_DCODE` safely handle their operations without introducing undefined behavior, especially for pointer manipulation or bitwise operations on incorrect data types. Validate these macros for strict aliasing and memory alignment issues.
