UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If the `tmp` pointer passed to the function is `NULL`, dereferencing it within functions like `strncmp()` and `strcpy()` causes undefined behavior. Additionally, if the `tmp` buffer is smaller than the data copied using `strcpy`, it can result in a buffer overflow, which is another form of undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow, Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not check whether the pointer `tmp` is `NULL` and blindly calls `strcpy()` and `strncmp()` on it. Also, it assumes `tmp` has sufficient space to store the result of `strcpy()`, but no validation of the buffer size is performed, leading to a potential buffer overflow if the buffer is too small.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Check if `tmp` is `NULL` at the beginning of the function:
   ```c
   if (tmp == NULL) {
       return; // Handle NULL pointer gracefully
   }
   ```
2. Ensure the size of `tmp` is sufficient before copying data into it. Replace `strcpy()` with a safer alternative like `snprintf()` to avoid overflows:
   ```c
   case 1:
       snprintf(tmp, MAX_SIZE, "C1");
       break;
   ```
   Replace `MAX_SIZE` with the appropriate size for `tmp`.

3. Document the expected size of `tmp` clearly or add assertions/checks related to the size at runtime.
