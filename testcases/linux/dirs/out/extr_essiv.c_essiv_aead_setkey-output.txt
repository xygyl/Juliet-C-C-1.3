UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. Potential overflow risk in the `salt` buffer when the size of the hash digest exceeds `HASH_MAX_DIGESTSIZE`. `HASH_MAX_DIGESTSIZE` is statically defined, but the actual size of the digest fetched by `crypto_shash_digestsize(tctx->hash)` could be larger than this predefined limit. If the digest size exceeds, it would result in a buffer overflow during `crypto_shash_finup()` operation.  
2. Using the `desc` pointer before it is fully initialized. Depending on the implementation of `SHASH_DESC_ON_STACK`, this could lead to UB if the macro does not initialize memory appropriately.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: As noted above, `salt` might not have sufficient size allocated to store the hash digest produced by `crypto_shash_finup()`. This could lead to memory corruption or other unintended behaviors. Additionally, improper handling of `desc` initialization might result in unpredictable behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Dynamically check the size of `crypto_shash_digestsize(tctx->hash)` before using it for operations involving `salt`. Adjust the size of `salt` accordingly or fail gracefully if the digest size exceeds expected bounds. Example:  
```c
if (crypto_shash_digestsize(tctx->hash) > HASH_MAX_DIGESTSIZE) {
    return -EINVAL; // Reject invalid configuration
}
```  
2. Ensure `desc` is properly initialized using all necessary macros or functions before performing operations with it.
