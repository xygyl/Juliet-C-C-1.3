UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `snprintf` function uses `sizeof(info->bus_info)` to determine the size of the buffer, but if `info->bus_info` is not a fixed-size array, this can lead to undefined behavior at runtime because `sizeof` may not yield the correct size for dynamically allocated memory or incomplete arrays. If it is guaranteed to be a fixed-size array, this must be explicitly stated or verified.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: There may be a risk of buffer overflow if the formatted string exceeds the actual size of `info->bus_info`. Since the code does not verify whether the formatted string is truncated, this could corrupt adjacent memory, leading to unpredictable behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Validate or explicitly define the size and type of `info->bus_info`. Add checks to ensure the formatted string fits within the buffer, or use a safer mechanism like a static size constant that matches the actual buffer size.
