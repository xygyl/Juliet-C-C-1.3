UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not verify the validity of the `filter_param` pointer before dereferencing it. If `filter_param` is NULL, dereferencing it in `data->direction` leads to undefined behavior (null pointer dereference).  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: Because `filter_param` is passed as a parameter and dereferenced without validation, passing a NULL pointer will cause a null pointer dereference.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for `filter_param` before dereferencing it. For example:  

```c
if (!filter_param)
    return false;
```
Or add appropriate assertions or safeguards based on expected API behavior.
