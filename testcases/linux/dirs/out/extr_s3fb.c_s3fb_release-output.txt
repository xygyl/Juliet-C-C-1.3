UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `info` or `info->par` is passed as `NULL`, dereferencing `info->par` leads to undefined behavior due to a null pointer dereference. Additionally, `restore_vga(&(par->state))` implicitly assumes `par->state` is properly initialized, which could lead to UB if uninitialized.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `info` or `info->par` is `NULL`, it causes a null pointer dereference. There is no explicit check to ensure `par` or `info` is valid.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function:  
```c
if (!info || !info->par) {  
    return -EINVAL;  
}
```  
Also ensure proper initialization of `par->state` before use in `restore_vga`.
