**UB Analysis:**
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Negating `INT_MIN` results in undefined behavior as per the C standard. The range of a signed `int` type is `[-2^31, 2^31-1]` on typical platforms. Negating `INT_MIN` (value `-2^31`) results in a mathematical value of `2^31`, which exceeds the maximum representable value (`2^31-1` for a signed `int`). Therefore, it causes signed integer overflow, which is undefined behavior.

**Bug Analysis:**
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The operation `val = -val;` is performing arithmetic on `INT_MIN`, which causes signed integer overflow. This constitutes a bug as it leads to undefined behavior, which can manifest in unpredictable runtime behavior or crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

**Fix Suggestion:**  
Introduce a check to prevent the negation of `INT_MIN`. For example:
```c
if (val != INT_MIN)
    val = -val;
else
    /* Handle the special case appropriately or report an error */;
```  
Alternatively, if negation must occur, consider using a wider integer type such as `long long` to store the intermediate results for safe manipulation, though this may require changes outside the scope of this function.
