Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_xonar_hdmi.c_xonar_hdmi_init.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Possible out-of-bounds access on the `hdmi->params` array due to lack of size definition or bounds checking associated with the array. Writing to `hdmi->params[4]` assumes the array size is greater than or equal to 5, which is not guaranteed.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The array `hdmi->params` may not have been initialized or allocated with a sufficient size to safely access indexes `1` and `4`. This could lead to memory corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Confirm and enforce that the `hdmi->params` array has been initialized and contains at least 5 elements before accessing these indices. Alternatively, check the array's accessibility using proper bounds checks before assignment.
