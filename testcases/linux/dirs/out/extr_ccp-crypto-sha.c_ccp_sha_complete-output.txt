Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_ccp-crypto-sha.c_ccp_sha_complete.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not check if `req->result` is `NULL` before passing it as the destination pointer to `memcpy`. If `req->result` is `NULL`, this results in undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference during memory write in `memcpy(req->result, rctx->ctx, digest_size)`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: As per the above analysis, there is no guarantee `req->result` is valid and non-NULL before use. A null pointer dereference could occur in `memcpy`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for `req->result` before calling `memcpy`. For example:  
```c
if (req->result && rctx->final) {
    memcpy(req->result, rctx->ctx, digest_size);
}
```
This ensures that `req->result` is properly validated before being used as a destination pointer.
