UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The comparison `sample->rtt_us < 0` is problematic because `rtt_us` is declared as `u32`, which is an unsigned 32-bit integer. Comparing an unsigned value to a negative number is undefined behavior according to the C standard because the comparison result is indeterminate when unsigned values interact with negative numbers. This is a form of logical undefined behavior. Additionally, it does not align with normal logic handling for unsigned types.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The `sample->rtt_us < 0` condition is always false for a `u32` type. This introduces a logic error because the intended behavior (filtering out invalid negative RTT values) does not occur. Though there is no explicit runtime failure, the logic flaw results in incorrect behavior under the assumption that negative values can exist for `rtt_us`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Change the condition `if (sample->rtt_us < 0)` to one that aligns with the correct data type and logic. For example, if negative values for RTT are invalid and should be filtered, ensure `rtt_us` is declared as a signed type such as `int` instead of `u32`. Alternatively, if negative RTT values are impossible with the current design, remove the check altogether.  
Example fix:
```c
if ((int)sample->rtt_us < 0)
    return;
```  
OR  
```c
// Assuming negative RTT values are invalid checks:
typedef int rtt_t; // Replace u32 with a signed integer type for rtt_us.
```  
OR remove the condition if negative RTT values cannot occur:
```c
// Remove `if (sample->rtt_us < 0)` if unnecessary.
```
