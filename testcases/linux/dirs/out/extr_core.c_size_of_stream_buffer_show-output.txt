UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function potentially accesses an out-of-bounds member of the `channel_vector` array via `c->iface->channel_vector[i]`. If `i` (derived from `c->channel_id`) exceeds the bounds of the array, this results in undefined behavior due to invalid memory access. The bounds of `channel_vector` are not verified within the function.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: The lack of bounds checking on `c->channel_id` (used as the index `i`) before accessing `c->iface->channel_vector[i]` can lead to incorrect memory access, crash, or unintended program behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Introduce a check to ensure that `i` (`c->channel_id`) is within valid bounds of the `channel_vector` array. For example, confirm `i >= 0` and `i < N`, where `N` is the size of the `channel_vector` array (if this size information is retrievable from `c->iface` at runtime).

Code example for fix:
```c
if (i >= 0 && i < size_of_channel_vector) {
    return snprintf(buf, PAGE_SIZE, "%d\n",
                    c->iface->channel_vector[i].buffer_size_streaming);
} else {
    return -EINVAL;  // Return an error code for invalid indices.
}
```
Ensure that `size_of_channel_vector` is properly initialized and points to the correct size of the `channel_vector` array.
