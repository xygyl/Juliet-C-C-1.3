Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dart_iommu.c_dart_device_on_pcie.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `dev->of_node` is `NULL`, `of_node_get(NULL)` will be called, which leads to undefined behavior as accessing or operating on a `NULL` pointer is undefined in C.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: There is no explicit check to ensure that `dev->of_node` is not `NULL` before calling `of_node_get()`. If `dev->of_node` is `NULL`, a subsequent `NULL` dereference or invalid memory access will occur.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for `dev->of_node` at the beginning of the function. For example:
```c
if (!dev->of_node)
    return false;
```
