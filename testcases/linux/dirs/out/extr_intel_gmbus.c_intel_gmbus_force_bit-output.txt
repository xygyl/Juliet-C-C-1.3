UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow can occur in `bus->force_bit += force_bit ? 1 : -1;`. The calculation modifies the signed integer `force_bit` based on dynamic conditions, and if the integer's value exceeds its bounds (e.g., INT_MAX or drops below INT_MIN due to excessive additions or subtractions), it results in undefined behavior per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer overflow/underflow
Bug Reason: The same calculation (`bus->force_bit += force_bit ? 1 : -1;`) risks an integer overflow or underflow of `force_bit` that can lead to incorrect functioning of the software. For example, an unexpected overflow might allow erroneous or unsafe state transitions in `force_bit` logic when working outside valid values.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Introduce validation checks to ensure `force_bit` does not exceed a safe range (e.g., a predefined maximum or minimum value for `bus->force_bit`) before adding or subtracting. For example:

```c
if (force_bit) {
    if (bus->force_bit < INT_MAX) {
        bus->force_bit++;
    }
} else {
    if (bus->force_bit > INT_MIN) {
        bus->force_bit--;
    }
}
```
This prevents undefined behavior and maintains logical integrity by constraining integer modifications within defined limits.
