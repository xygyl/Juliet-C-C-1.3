UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not verify the validity of the `stream` pointer before dereferencing it. If `stream` is `NULL`, accessing its members and dereferencing it (e.g., `stream->signal`, `stream->timing`) leads to undefined behavior according to the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: Dereferencing `stream` without checking if it's a valid pointer introduces a potential null pointer dereference bug. If the caller provides a `NULL` argument, the program may crash or behave unpredictably.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a `NULL` check for `stream` at the beginning of the function, e.g.:
```c
if (stream == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
This will prevent undefined behavior and the corresponding null pointer dereference bug.
