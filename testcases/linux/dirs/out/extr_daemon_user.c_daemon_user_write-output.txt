UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `pri->data_addr` or `pri` is `NULL`, dereferencing `pri->data_addr` will result in undefined behavior. Additionally, there is no validation for `buf` or its contents; although not strictly UB, passing an invalid pointer to `net_sendto` can cause undefined behavior at runtime.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference and potential logic flaw.  
Bug Reason: The function assumes `pri`, `pri->data_addr`, and `buf` are all valid and non-NULL without any checks. If any of these pointers are NULL, it would lead to a null pointer dereference or unexpected runtime behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add validity checks for `pri`, `pri->data_addr`, and `buf` before attempting to use them. For example:  
```c
if (!pri || !pri->data_addr || !buf) {
    return -1; // Or an appropriate error code
}
```
