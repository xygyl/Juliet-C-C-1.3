UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function has potential undefined behavior due to unaligned memory access when `ALIGN(num_bytes, 4)` increases `num_bytes` to a multiple of 4. This can lead to mismatched copying between `src` and `src_tmp`; if `num_bytes` is not already aligned, the memcpy from `src` to `src_tmp` may go out-of-bounds, violating memory safety. Additionally, `ALIGN` and casts such as `cpu_to_le32` rely on platform-specific macros which may lead to strict alignment or aliasing violations depending on pointer types.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The potential buffer overflow arises when the function attempts to access beyond valid memory bounds of the `src` array during the initial `memcpy(src_tmp, src, align_num_bytes)` invocation. If `align_num_bytes` is larger than `num_bytes`, this may cause a read violation beyond the allocated memory for `src`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add strict checks for the size of `num_bytes` against the actual valid size of both `src` and `dst` buffers before performing `memcpy()` operations. For example:
```c
if (num_bytes > sizeof(src) || ALIGN(num_bytes, 4) > sizeof(src)) {
    // Handle error or truncate num_bytes appropriately
    return;
}
```
Alternatively, avoid using raw buffers and adopt safe abstractions with explicit bounds validation frameworks where possible.
