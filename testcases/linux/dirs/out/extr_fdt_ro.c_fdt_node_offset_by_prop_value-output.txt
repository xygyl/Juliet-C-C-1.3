UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `memcmp(val, propval, len)` can trigger undefined behavior because it uses the `len` parameter that is passed directly from `fdt_getprop`. If `val` is `NULL`, and `memcmp` is called, it will dereference a null pointer, resulting in UB. Additionally, the function assumes `proplen` provided by the caller matches the actual length of `propval`, which isn't explicitly validated. This could propagate UB if `proplen` does not correctly describe the size of `propval`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `fdt_getprop` returns `NULL` for `val` (indicating the property isn't found), the code proceeds to call `memcmp(val, propval, len)`. This attempts to compare data inside a `NULL` pointer, triggering a null pointer dereference at runtime. This would lead to undefined behavior and a program crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before calling `memcmp(val, propval, len)`, check if `val` is not `NULL`. Example:
```c
if (val && (len == proplen) && (memcmp(val, propval, len) == 0))
    return offset;
```
