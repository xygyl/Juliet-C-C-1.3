UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code assigns the result of `submit->cmdbuf.size - 8` to `submit->cmdbuf.user_size`. If `submit->cmdbuf.size` is less than 8, this will result in a negative value being stored in the `user_size` field, which is of type `scalar_t__`. Since `scalar_t__` may be an unsigned type depending on system/platform customization, assigning a negative value can lead to undefined behavior per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Underflow
Bug Reason: If `submit->cmdbuf.size` is less than 8, the subtraction `submit->cmdbuf.size - 8` will cause an integer underflow, resulting in potentially a very large value being assigned to `submit->cmdbuf.user_size`. This could later lead to buffer-related bugs or incorrect behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check before assigning to `submit->cmdbuf.user_size`, such as:
```c
if (submit->cmdbuf.size < 8) {
   DRM_ERROR("Invalid command buffer size\n");
   return NULL;
}
submit->cmdbuf.user_size = submit->cmdbuf.size - 8;
```
This ensures that underflow is prevented, and an error is reported if the size is invalid.
