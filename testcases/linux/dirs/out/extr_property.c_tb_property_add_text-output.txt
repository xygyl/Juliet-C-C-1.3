### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `round_up(strlen(text) + 1, 4)` calculation assumes `text` is non-NULL, but there is no check to ensure `text` is not NULL before calling `strlen(text)`. If `text` is NULL, calling `strlen` leads to undefined behavior because it dereferences a NULL pointer.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `text` is NULL when passed to `tb_property_add_text`, the function will attempt to compute the size using `strlen`, causing a NULL pointer dereference. Furthermore, `strcpy(property->value.text, text)` will trigger another instance of NULL pointer dereference. Additionally, the allocation (`kzalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL)`) should ideally check for the validity of `size` to handle potential overflow scenarios from an exceptionally large input length (theoretically).  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
1. Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `text` is not NULL:
```c
if (!text)
    return -EINVAL;
```

2. Enhance safety by validating `strlen(text)` for extreme input lengths that might lead to buffer overflows or large memory allocations that the system cannot handle:
```c
if (strlen(text) > MAX_ALLOWED_LENGTH)
    return -EINVAL;
```
(MAX_ALLOWED_LENGTH should be defined based on the specific limits acceptable in the system.)

By implementing these fixes, both the UB and the bug can be mitigated.
