Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_indydog.c_indydog_open.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing indydog_alive using `test_and_set_bit()` may cause undefined behavior because `indydog_alive` is declared as `int`, a scalar type; but `test_and_set_bit()` usually operates on an `unsigned long` type or similar, leading to possible misalignment issues or data corruption depending on the platform and compiler. This violates strict aliasing rules and could cause UB during runtime.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Misaligned memory access
Bug Reason: `indydog_alive` is likely misaligned or insufficiently declared for safe bit manipulation via `test_and_set_bit()`, which can cause memory corruption or unexpected behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Declare `indydog_alive` using a proper type (`unsigned long` or similar) that aligns with operands expected by bit manipulation functions like `test_and_set_bit()`.

Example:
```c
unsigned long indydog_alive;
```
