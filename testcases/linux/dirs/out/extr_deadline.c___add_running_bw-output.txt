Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_deadline.c___add_running_bw.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow could occur when `dl_rq->running_bw += dl_bw;` since the operation uses `u64` variables. In C, signed integer overflow results in undefined behavior. There is no guarantee that the sum won't exceed the maximum value of `u64` due to the addition operation.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer overflow logic flaw  
Bug Reason: Even though `SCHED_WARN_ON(dl_rq->running_bw < old);` checks for overflow after the addition, if `dl_rq->running_bw` exceeds the range of `u64`, the behavior is undefined before the check occurs. This code effectively assumes wrapping doesnâ€™t happen, which constitutes a bug susceptible to overflow. Additionally, logical guarantees such as "`dl_rq->running_bw` exceeding `dl_rq->this_bw`" do not protect against non-deterministic effects of UB.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:

1. Introduce a pre-check before performing the addition operation to ensure enough space in `u64` exists:
```c
if (dl_rq->running_bw > U64_MAX - dl_bw) {
    /* Handle overflow error safely */
    return;
}
```

2. Alternatively, consider redesigning the data types or logic to avoid relying on the limits of unsigned 64-bit arithmetic.
