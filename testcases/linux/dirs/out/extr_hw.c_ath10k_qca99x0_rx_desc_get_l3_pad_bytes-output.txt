UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not verify whether the `rxd` pointer is `NULL` before dereferencing it. Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer results in undefined behavior according to the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `rxd` is passed as `NULL`, the dereferencing of `rxd->msdu_end.qca99x0.info1` will cause a crash or undefined behavior. This constitutes a logic issue in the function implementation.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a `NULL` pointer check at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (rxd == NULL) {
    return -1; // Handle the error case appropriately.
}
```
