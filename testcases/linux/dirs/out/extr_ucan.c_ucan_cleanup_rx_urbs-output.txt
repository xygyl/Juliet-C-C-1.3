Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_ucan.c_ucan_cleanup_rx_urbs.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `memset` function usage at the end of the function is incorrect. It uses `sizeof(*urbs)` instead of `sizeof(struct urb *)`, which will only clear the memory equivalent to a single pointer, regardless of the `UCAN_MAX_RX_URBS` value, potentially leading to partial memory corruption or unintended behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The incorrect size in the `memset` function causes the array of pointers (`urbs`) to be improperly cleared, leading to potential stale entries or data inconsistency in the array when the function is called.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Replace `sizeof(*urbs) * UCAN_MAX_RX_URBS` in `memset` with `sizeof(struct urb *) * UCAN_MAX_RX_URBS` to correctly clear the entire pointer array.

Line to fix:
```c
memset(urbs, 0, sizeof(struct urb *) * UCAN_MAX_RX_URBS);
```
