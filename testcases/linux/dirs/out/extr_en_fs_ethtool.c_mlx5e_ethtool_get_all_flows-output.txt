### UB Analysis

UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain any operations that directly result in undefined behavior as per the C standard. There are no signed integer overflows, null pointer dereferences, uninitialized variables, out-of-bounds accesses, or violations of strict aliasing rules detectable from the code provided. The loop increments and access to the `rule_locs` array happen in a controlled manner, given that the index is bounded by `info->rule_cnt`.

### Bug Analysis

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function uses a loop controlled by the condition `idx < info->rule_cnt`, but it fails to verify whether `rule_locs[idx]` has enough allocated space to accommodate all indices up to `info->rule_cnt`. If `rule_cnt` is larger than the memory allocated to `rule_locs`, this will lead to memory corruption (buffer overflow). Without explicit safeguards or context about the size of `rule_locs`, this represents a potential memory-related bug.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Introduce a size check prior to writing to the `rule_locs` array. For example:
```c
if (idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(rule_locs)) {
    return -ENOMEM; // or other appropriate error handling
}
```
Alternatively, ensure explicitly at the call site that `rule_locs` is large enough to hold `info->rule_cnt` elements.
