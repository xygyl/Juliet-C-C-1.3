UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function accesses `priv->socdata->groups[selector]` without validating `selector`. If `selector` exceeds the bounds of the `groups` array, it results in out-of-bounds access, which is undefined behavior under the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related bug, specifically out-of-bounds array access.
Bug Reason: The `selector` parameter is not checked against the bounds of the `groups` array before it is used to index the array. This could lead to accessing invalid memory and potentially crashing the program or exhibiting undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check for `selector` to ensure it is less than the number of groups in `priv->socdata` before accessing `groups[selector]`.

Example fix:
```c
if (selector >= priv->socdata->num_groups) {
    return -EINVAL; // Invalid argument
}
*pins = priv->socdata->groups[selector].pins;
*num_pins = priv->socdata->groups[selector].num_pins;
```
