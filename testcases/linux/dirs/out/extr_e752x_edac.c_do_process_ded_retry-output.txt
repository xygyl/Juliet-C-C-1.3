### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Potential Uninitialized Memory Access**: The variable `row` might be used without proper initialization if the condition in `pvt->mc_symmetric ? ((page >> 1) & 3)` is false and `edac_mc_find_csrow_by_page(mci, page)` does not handle all possible cases or returns an invalid value. This depends on the implementation of `edac_mc_find_csrow_by_page`.
2. **Significant Type Misalignment Risk**: The variable `retry_add` (which is of type `u32`) is shifted right by `(PAGE_SHIFT - 4)` bits to compute `page`. While this code appears correct, if `PAGE_SHIFT` results in an invalid or undefined bit shift (e.g., it is too large relative to the number of bits in `u32`), this operation results in undefined behavior.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason:  
1. **Row Assignment Logic**: The logic for row number assignment (`row` determination) might not cover all valid scenarios for `mc_symmetric`. If `row` is improperly calculated or uses invalid information, downstream operations could fail or behave incorrectly. The code does not verify that `row` is valid before passing it to `e752x_mc_printk`.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  

### Fix Suggestion
1. Initialize `row` to a sentinel value (e.g., `-1`) and verify its validity before usage in `e752x_mc_printk`.  
2. Add specific checks for the validity of `PAGE_SHIFT` and edge cases related to `page` computation. Ensure the right-shift operation is safe.  
3. Verify and validate the output from `edac_mc_find_csrow_by_page(mci, page)` to ensure it returns usable results in all circumstances.
