UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The use of `PTR_ALIGN()` to align a pointer results in pointer arithmetic on `u8 *skcipher_request_ctx(req)` without evidence that `skcipher_request_ctx(req)` points to a properly allocated buffer capable of handling the alignment adjustment. If the alignment size causes `PTR_ALIGN()` to produce a pointer address that exceeds the allocated buffer boundaries, the behavior is undefined. This violates the C standard constraint that pointer arithmetic must remain within the bounds of allocated memory objects.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential memory overflow  
Bug Reason: The `PTR_ALIGN()` function adjusts the `skcipher_request_ctx` pointer based on the `crypto_skcipher_alignmask` value. If the alignment adjustment causes the pointer to move beyond the bounds of the memory region allocated for `skcipher_request_ctx`, subsequent use of `rctx->subreq` or `rctx->iv` may lead to a buffer overflow leading to memory corruption or unexpected behavior. There is no explicit verification of buffer sizes or allocation prior to alignment.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `skcipher_request_ctx(req)` points to a buffer that is guaranteed to accommodate the alignment adjustment and subsequent operations. This can be done by explicitly checking the buffer size or ensuring it is properly allocated with sufficient space beforehand. Additionally, write comments or safeguard checks to validate alignment and buffer usage to prevent violations.
