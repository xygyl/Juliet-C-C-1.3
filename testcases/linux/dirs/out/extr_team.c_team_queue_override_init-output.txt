Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_team.c_team_queue_override_init.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `INIT_LIST_HEAD(listarr++)` call increments the `listarr` pointer for every iteration of the loop. This results in undefined behavior as `listarr++` modifies the pointer, and subsequent iterations begin accessing unintended memory locations.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw, Memory Corruption  
Bug Reason: Incrementing the pointer `listarr` not only breaks the intended functionality (to initialize all heads properly), but risks corrupting memory outside the intended array bounds on later iterations. This can lead to unpredictable behavior or crashes at runtime.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Modify the loop to use `INIT_LIST_HEAD(listarr[i])` instead of incrementing `listarr`, to properly initialize each list within the allocated array.

Corrected loop:
```c
for (i = 0; i < queue_cnt; i++)
    INIT_LIST_HEAD(listarr[i]);
```
