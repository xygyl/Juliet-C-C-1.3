UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access. The value of `chip->prox_rate` is unvalidated, which may cause access to an invalid index in the `prox_rates_hz` array, leading to undefined behavior. The C standard states that accessing an array element out of its allocated bounds results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw / Array Bounds  
Bug Reason: If `chip->prox_rate` contains a value that is greater than or equal to the size of the `prox_rates_hz` array or a negative value, this will lead to accessing invalid indices, potentially crashing the program or corrupting memory. The function does not validate `chip->prox_rate` before using it.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add proper validation for `chip->prox_rate` to ensure it is within the bounds of the `prox_rates_hz` array. For example:

```c
if (chip->prox_rate < 0 || chip->prox_rate >= ARRAY_SIZE(prox_rates_hz)) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return an appropriate error code if index is invalid.
}
```

Additional Note: Ensure `prox_rates_hz` is properly defined in the translation unit and its size is accessible for validation (e.g., via `ARRAY_SIZE(prox_rates_hz)` macro or equivalent).
