Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_platform.c_dwc2_driver_remove.c  
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function follows correct usage patterns and there is no evidence of dereferencing null or invalid pointers, accessing uninitialized variables, integer overflows, or violating language rules.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: `hsotg` is fetched via `platform_get_drvdata(dev)`, but its validity is not checked (e.g., `hsotg == NULL`). If `platform_get_drvdata` returns NULL, subsequent dereferences (`hsotg->hcd_enabled` or function calls like `dwc2_hcd_remove(hsotg)`) would lead to undefined and unsafe behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check after obtaining `hsotg`:  

```c
struct dwc2_hsotg *hsotg = platform_get_drvdata(dev);
if (!hsotg)
    return -EINVAL;
```
