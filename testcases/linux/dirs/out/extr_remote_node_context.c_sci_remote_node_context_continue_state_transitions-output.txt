UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate if the `rnc` pointer is non-NULL before dereferencing it. If `rnc` is NULL when passed to the function, dereferencing `rnc->destination_state`, `rnc->user_callback`, or `rnc->user_cookie` results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: Dereferencing a potentially NULL pointer (`rnc`) without checking its validity can crash the program or lead to unexpected behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL pointer check at the beginning of the function:  
```c
if (rnc == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
