UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `atomic_read` and `atomic_set` functions use atomic operations on `core->stc`. However, the `core` structure is passed as a pointer and the function does not perform explicit null checks on the pointer before dereferencing it. If `core` is `NULL` when the function is called, dereferencing `core->stc` leads to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: There is no validation of whether the `core` pointer is `NULL`. If `core` is `NULL`, the function will attempt to access `core->stc` and other members of the `core` structure, causing null pointer dereference and potentially crashing the program.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Before using the `core` pointer, add a null check like below:  
```c
if (!core) {
    return -EINVAL; // or appropriate error handling code
}
```  
This ensures the function gracefully handles the case where `core` is NULL.
