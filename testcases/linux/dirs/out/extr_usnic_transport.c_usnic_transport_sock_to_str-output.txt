Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_usnic_transport.c_usnic_transport_sock_to_str.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing the variables `addr`, `port`, and `proto` without initializing them can lead to undefined behavior because their initial values are indeterminate. If `usnic_transport_sock_get_addr` fails, these variables remain uninitialized when passed to `scnprintf`. This violates the C standard.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: If `usnic_transport_sock_get_addr` fails and `err != 0`, returning `0` without validating the contents of `buf` will leave the buffer unpopulated and possibly misleading regarding the attempted operation. In that case, passing uninitialized variables (`addr`, `port`, `proto`) into `scnprintf` may corrupt memory or cause undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure proper initialization of variables `addr`, `port`, and `proto` before passing them into function calls. For example:  

```c
uint32_t addr = 0;  
uint16_t port = 0;  
int proto = 0;  
```

Additionally, consider populating `buf` with an appropriate error message if `usnic_transport_sock_get_addr` fails. Example:  

```c
if (err) {  
    scnprintf(buf, buf_sz, "Error retrieving socket address");  
    return 0;  
}
```  
This ensures predictable behavior and avoids UB.
