Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nct6683.c_show_fan_min.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing an array element `data->fan_min[nr]` without bounds validation can lead to undefined behavior if `nr` is outside the valid range of the array.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access
Bug Reason: The function accesses `data->fan_min[nr]` without checking if `nr` is within the valid index range for the array `fan_min`. If `nr` is negative or exceeds the size of the array, this could result in either accessing invalid memory or corrupting the program state.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `nr` is within the valid range (e.g., `0 <= nr < ARRAY_SIZE(data->fan_min)`), where `ARRAY_SIZE` is a macro that calculates the number of elements in the array `fan_min`.
