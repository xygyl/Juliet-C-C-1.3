### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not check if `src` and `dest` pointers are valid (i.e., non-NULL). Dereferencing `src` or assigning values to `dest` while they are NULL would result in undefined behavior. Additionally, this function assumes `src` and `dest` point to valid arrays of sufficient size without checking their actual bounds.
  
### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related undefined behavior
Bug Reason: If `src` is smaller than `pkg_cnt * 32` elements or `dest` is smaller than `pkg_cnt * 32` elements, this function will result in a buffer overflow or out‐of‐bounds memory access. This is because the loop runs without checking the size of the arrays these pointers reference.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Add validation to ensure `src` and `dest` are non-NULL before dereferencing them.
2. Check the actual allocated size for `src` and `dest` to prevent out-of-bounds access. This requires additional parameters or external context to verify their bounds.
For example:
```c
if (!src || !dest) {
    return -1;
}

/* Additional bounds checking might be needed here */
```
