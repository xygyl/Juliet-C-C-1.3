Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_ip27-irq.c_ip27_do_irq_mask1.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `__ffs(pend1)` may return `scalar_t__` (signed type), which when added to `64` could cause signed integer overflow if `pend1` is crafted adversarially. Furthermore, `irq_linear_revmap(domain, __ffs(pend1) + 64)` may result in accessing invalid indices in the domain, and `per_cpu(irq_enable_mask, cpu)` could dereference an invalid pointer if CPU mapping isn't correct.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function assumes `__ffs(pend1)` always succeeds and does proper bounds-key. On Fuzz engineering, surprious-spurmay Nervyscripting soft-limit exploration of many `pendents>`  
Bug Caused by UB:  YES
