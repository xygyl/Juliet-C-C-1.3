UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses the macro `IS_ERR` on `ts_conf` to check for errors, but `ts_conf` is not null-checked before being passed into `PTR_ERR`, leading to potential undefined behavior (dereferencing invalid or null pointers). Additionally, integer comparison (e.g., `conf->from_offset > conf->to_offset`) involving unverified scalar types may introduce UB if these offsets go out of bounds or represent invalid memory regions.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: If `textsearch_prepare` fails to allocate memory or initializes the structure incorrectly, `ts_conf` might be invalid or null. Using it in `IS_ERR` and then passing it to `PTR_ERR` without proper null validation can cause runtime crashes. Furthermore, checks like `conf->from_offset > conf->to_offset` may cause logical failures if `conf->to_offset` is smaller than `conf->from_offset`, unless explicitly allowed.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Insert a proper check for null values or invalid pointers for `ts_conf` before applying the `IS_ERR` macro or dereferencing it. Also, ensure that all scalar types (such as `conf->from_offset` and `conf->to_offset`) are validated to ensure they fall within expected ranges before being compared or used further. Add unit tests for error conditions in `textsearch_prepare` scenarios.
