Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_audio_codec.c_gbcodec_probe.c

UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function does not contain any undefined behavior. Memory operations are performed using kernel-specific helper functions such as `devm_kzalloc`, which are designed to avoid typical undefined behavior issues like uninitialized memory access or invalid pointer dereferencing. There is no evidence of signed integer overflow, null pointer dereferencing, or violations of strict aliasing rules. Furthermore, `ARRAY_SIZE` ensures no out-of-bounds array access.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Leak
Bug Reason: If the loop allocating memory for `gbaudio_codec_dai` structures fails (`devm_kzalloc` returns NULL), the function exits early with `return -ENOMEM`. However, memory allocated for `info` earlier in the function is not freed before the early return, leading to a memory leak.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure proper cleanup for the allocated memory (`info`) in case the loop early-exits due to allocation failure. For example:

```c
info = devm_kzalloc(codec->dev, sizeof(*info), GFP_KERNEL);
if (!info)
    return -ENOMEM;

for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(gbaudio_dai); i++) {
    dai = devm_kzalloc(codec->dev, sizeof(*dai), GFP_KERNEL);
    if (!dai) {
        devm_kfree(codec->dev, info);
        return -ENOMEM;
    }
    dai->id = gbaudio_dai[i].id;
    list_add(&dai->list, &info->dai_list);
}
```
