Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_xdr.c_xdr_restrict_buflen.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function contains pointer arithmetic on a `void*`, which is undefined behavior in C. The lines `(void *)xdr->end - (void *)xdr->p` and `(void *)xdr->end + newbuflen - end_offset` interpret `void*` as objects suitable for pointer arithmetic, but pointer arithmetic is only allowed for fully typed pointers. This will lead to UB as per the C standard (ISO/IEC 9899).  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw, UB-induced Bug  
Bug Reason: Due to the undefined behavior caused by pointer arithmetic on `void*`, the calculation of `left_in_this_buf` and the adjustment of `xdr->end` can result in runtime errors or incorrect behavior. For example, manipulating the `xdr->end` pointer with invalid arithmetic may corrupt internal struct state or result in incorrect boundary calculations.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: To resolve both the UB and the bug, avoid performing arithmetic on `void*` by casting to a `char*` (or other byte-addressable pointer) before performing pointer arithmetic. Example fix:
```c
int left_in_this_buf = (char *)xdr->end - (char *)xdr->p;
if (newbuflen < end_offset)
    xdr->end = (char *)xdr->end + newbuflen - end_offset;
```
