Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_stat-display.c_get_precision.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `log10` function can encounter undefined behavior if `num` is passed as a negative value or zero, as the logarithm of a non-positive number is undefined in mathematics and the C standard does not specify behavior for such cases.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: There is no sanity check in the function to ensure `num` is greater than zero before calling `log10`. Negative or zero values for `num` will result in incorrect behavior or runtime errors.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `num` is positive before calling `log10`. For example:  
```c
if (num <= 0) {
    // Handle error appropriately or return a default precision
    return -1; // Example of error handling
}
```
