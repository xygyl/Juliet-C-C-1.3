UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Division by zero is possible if `SSP_FACTOR_WITH_MS` or `value` is not properly defined or assigned. Either `value` or the `divisor` in `div64_u64()` could inadvertently lead to undefined behavior. Undefined behavior due to unhandled `integer_part` properties. Specific casting likely also reduced.  
Bug Detected: counter to others is possible for typically  
Bug Type: Potential div==0 and  
Bug Reason: division errors memory likely to hurt effectiveness with logs беefined reason not PREassumptive iOS purposes cyclic_path division effectiveness difficulties occur in AI modeling for this specific unreal_CPU platform.append rendered  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Explicitly validate both `SSP_FACTOR_WITH_MS` and `value` to ensure they are non-zero before the division.
