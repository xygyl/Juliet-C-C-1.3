Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fadump.c_fadump_alloc_buffer.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Pointer arithmetic on `page` (`page + i`) is undefined behavior because `page` is a non-array object and not guaranteed to represent contiguous memory. The C standard does not define behavior for non-array pointer arithmetic. If `virt_to_page(vaddr)` returns non-contiguous memory, incrementing it via `page + i` is invalid. Furthermore, the result of this arithmetic is passed to `mark_page_reserved`, which assumes the memory is contiguous.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Possible logic/memory bug
Bug Reason: `page + i` may not reference valid memory within the expected range if `virt_to_page(vaddr)` does not guarantee that pages are laid out contiguously, leading to possible incorrect memory access or marking incorrect pages as reserved.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Instead of relying on pointer arithmetic on `page`, use an array or a mechanism that explicitly handles page indexing to ensure the memory references are valid.
