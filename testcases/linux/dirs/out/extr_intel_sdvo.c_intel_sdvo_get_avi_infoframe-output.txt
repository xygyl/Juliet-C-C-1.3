Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel_sdvo.c_intel_sdvo_get_avi_infoframe.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function accesses the array `sdvo_data` without fully verifying its bounds or ensuring that `len` is within the valid range of `sizeof(sdvo_data)` during the call to `hdmi_infoframe_unpack`. If `len` exceeds the size of `sdvo_data`, it could lead to out-of-bounds memory access, invoking undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Memory Access
Bug Reason: In the call to `hdmi_infoframe_unpack(frame, sdvo_data, len)`, the size of `len` is directly derived from `intel_sdvo_read_infoframe`, but the code does not validate `len` to ensure it is within the bounds of `sizeof(sdvo_data)`. This can lead to memory corruption or segmentation faults if `len` is larger than expected.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: Before invoking `hdmi_infoframe_unpack`, validate `len` to ensure it does not exceed the size of `sdvo_data`. For example:

```c
if (len > sizeof(sdvo_data)) {
    DRM_DEBUG_KMS("AVI infoframe size exceeds sdvo_data buffer\n");
    return;
}
```
This ensures the function does not attempt to unpack an infoframe with a size larger than the buffer's capacity.
