Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mtk_vcodec_enc.c_mtk_venc_find_format.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `NUM_FORMATS` is set to a value larger than the actual length of the `mtk_video_formats` array, the function accesses out-of-bounds memory. Accessing memory beyond the boundary of the array results in undefined behavior. Additionally, the comparison `fmt->fourcc == f->fmt.pix.pixelformat` assumes the dereferenced pointer `fmt->fourcc` is valid, which might not hold true in cases of corrupted or invalid memory.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The loop iterates up to `NUM_FORMATS`, but there is no guarantee that the `mtk_video_formats` array contains at least `NUM_FORMATS` elements. If `NUM_FORMATS` exceeds the array bounds, this causes reading from uninitialized or invalid memory, potentially leading to crashes or incorrect results.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Verify that `NUM_FORMATS` matches the size of the `mtk_video_formats` array. Alternatively, introduce a proper mechanism (e.g., a macro or `sizeof` approach) to determine the actual size of the array at compile time and use it in the loop condition.

For instance:  
```c
#define ARRAY_SIZE(arr) (sizeof(arr) / sizeof((arr)[0]))
for (k = 0; k < ARRAY_SIZE(mtk_video_formats); k++) {
    fmt = &mtk_video_formats[k];
    if (fmt->fourcc == f->fmt.pix.pixelformat)
        return fmt;
}
```  
This ensures the loop does not access memory beyond the valid range.
