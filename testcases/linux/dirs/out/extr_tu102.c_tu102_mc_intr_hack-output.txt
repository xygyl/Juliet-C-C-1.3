UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences a pointer (`device`) without verifying its validity. If `device` is null, this would lead to undefined behavior through a null pointer dereference.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `device`, obtained from `mc->subdev.device`, is always a valid pointer. If `device` is null, calls such as `nvkm_rd32(device, 0xb81010)` or `nvkm_wr32(device, ...)` will result in a null pointer dereference, causing a runtime crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Check if `device` is null at the start of the function. For example:
```c
if (!device)
    return;
```
This prevents subsequent invalid memory access when `device` is null.
