UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences the `priv` pointer (`priv->rst_regmap` and `priv->id`) without checking if it's null, which can lead to undefined behavior if `priv` is null.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The dereference of `priv` without validation can cause a null pointer dereference if the function is called with a null `priv` argument.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `priv` at the start of the function:  
```c
if (priv == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
