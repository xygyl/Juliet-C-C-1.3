Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_socrates_nand.c_socrates_nand_probe.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: There is potential undefined behavior due to dereferencing an invalid pointer. The call to `iounmap(host->io_base)` in the `out` label assumes that `host->io_base` was successfully mapped, but `host->io_base` may contain `NULL` if `of_iomap(ofdev->dev.of_node, 0)` fails. Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer is undefined behavior according to the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Bug
Bug Reason: The error path fails to ensure `iounmap(host->io_base)` is only called when `host->io_base` is a valid mapped address. This could lead to unintended consequences or undefined behavior at runtime when `host->io_base` is `NULL`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a conditional check before calling `iounmap(host->io_base)` in the error path:
```c
if (host->io_base) {
    iounmap(host->io_base);
}
```
This ensures that `iounmap` is only executed when `host->io_base` is a valid pointer that was successfully allocated by `of_iomap`.
