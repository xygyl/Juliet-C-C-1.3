UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Potential Signed Integer Overflow**: The use of `iv->interval.numerator * 10000` directly involves multiplication of integers, which can lead to signed integer overflow if the resulting value exceeds the range of the signed integer type (`int`). Signed integer overflow is undefined behavior in C.  
2. **Potential Misuse of `do_div`**: The `do_div` macro modifies its first argument in place, which may not align with its intended use, though this does not inherently lead to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Signed Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason: Signed integer overflow might occur when performing the calculation: `req_int = (u64)fi->interval.numerator * 10000`. If `fi->interval.numerator` is large, the result of multiplying it by `10000` could exceed the range of an `int` before it is cast to `u64`. Similarly, `(iv->interval.numerator * 10000) / iv->interval.denominator` could also overflow if `iv->interval.numerator` is very large.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
To avoid signed integer overflow, the multiplication should be performed with proper casting to `u64` or ensure that all intermediate calculations are performed using `u64` operands. For example:  
```c
req_int = fi->interval.numerator * (u64)10000;  
```  
Additionally, verify that `iv->interval.numerator * 10000` is cast to `u64` before multiplication. Ensure no integer promotions to signed occurs where unintended.
