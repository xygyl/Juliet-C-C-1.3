### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain any signs of undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. All pointers and structures appear initialized or properly typed, integer operations are constrained (no direct evidence of overflow), and the memory access occurs in controlled manners within loop boundaries. Mutex operations are used correctly to ensure concurrency safety for shared resources.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: **Logic Bug**  
Bug Reason: The loop runs twice (`idx = 0` to `idx < 2`), and depending on the `harvest_config` bitmask, instances are skipped if `(adev->vce.harvest_config & (1 << idx))` evaluates true. However, there's no validation to ensure that `harvest_config` has a valid range of bits (`0` or `1`). If bits outside the supported range (`idx` or indices greater than 1) are unintentionally set, the logic may behave incorrectly and potentially perform no operations on allowed instances, silently failing to stop valid instances.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Introduce validation for the range of bits in `harvest_config` during initialization or before calling this function, ensuring no unsupported bits are set.

Example:
```c
if (idx < 0 || idx >= 2 || (adev->vce.harvest_config & ~0x3)) {
    // Log an error or reset config
}
```
