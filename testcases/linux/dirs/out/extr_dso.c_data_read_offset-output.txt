Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_dso.c_data_read_offset.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The expression `offset + size < offset` relies on unsigned integer arithmetic (u64 is an unsigned type). This can lead to undefined behavior when `offset + size` exceeds the maximum value for `u64` and overflows, which may incorrectly evaluate as `true` due to the modulo operation inherent in unsigned arithmetic.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer overflow
Bug Reason: The check `offset + size < offset` does not properly safeguard against cases where `offset + size` overflows. While unsigned arithmetic wraps, this leads to incorrect logic and potentially attempts to read out-of-bounds memory via `cached_read`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Change the overflow check to avoid relying on wrapping arithmetic:

```c
if (offset > dso->data.file_size || size > dso->data.file_size - offset)
    return -1;
```

This approach ensures `offset + size` is bounded correctly without risking overflow during the addition.
