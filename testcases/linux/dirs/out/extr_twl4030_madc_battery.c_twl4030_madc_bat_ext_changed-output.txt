### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain any undefined behavior based on the C standard. The only operation performed is calling `power_supply_changed()` with the argument `psy`, which is a pointer passed into the function. There are no dereferences or arithmetic operations that could cause undefined behavior in this code snippet.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `psy` is always a valid pointer and does not check whether it is `NULL` before passing it to `power_supply_changed()`. If `psy` were `NULL` when the function is called, the behavior would result in a null pointer dereference, potentially causing a runtime crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a `NULL` check for `psy` before calling `power_supply_changed()`. For example:  

```c
if (psy != NULL) {
    power_supply_changed(psy);
}
```
This would ensure that the function handles the case where `psy` is `NULL` gracefully.
