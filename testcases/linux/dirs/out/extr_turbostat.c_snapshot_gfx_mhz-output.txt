### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: No instances of undefined behavior as per the C standard are present in this function. The code does not exhibit signed integer overflow, memory misalignment, null pointer dereference, or strict aliasing violations.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, Potential resource leak  
Bug Reason:
1. **Logic Flaw**: The function uses a static `FILE` pointer `fp` that is initialized with `fopen_or_die()` but never explicitly closed with `fclose`. This can lead to a resource leak if the file continues to remain open for an extended period.
2. **Potential Error Handling Issue**: If `fscanf` fails to read the required integer value into `gfx_cur_mhz`, the `err()` function is called with an exit value of 1. This immediately terminates the program without closing the file referenced by `fp`. This can exacerbate the resource leak problem.

Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Ensure the file pointer `fp` is properly closed using `fclose()` either when the program ends or when it is no longer required in the function.
2. Refactor the error handling mechanism. Instead of terminating the program immediately via `err()`, report the error, close the file, and return an appropriate error code.

Proposed fix:
```c
int snapshot_gfx_mhz(void)
{
    static FILE *fp;
    int retval;

    if (fp == NULL)
        fp = fopen_or_die("/sys/class/graphics/fb0/device/drm/card0/gt_cur_freq_mhz", "r");
    else {
        rewind(fp);
        fflush(fp);
    }

    retval = fscanf(fp, "%d", &gfx_cur_mhz);
    if (retval != 1) {
        // Optionally handle the error without terminating
        fclose(fp);
        fp = NULL;  // Avoid dangling pointer
        return -1;  // Indicate failure
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This fix ensures proper resource management and enhances error handling robustness.
