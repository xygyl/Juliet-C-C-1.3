UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential null pointer dereference. The function operates on the `chip` pointer without performing null pointer checks. If `chip` is `NULL`, dereferencing it (e.g., in `wait_handshake(chip)` or `clear_handshake(chip)`) would invoke undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `chip` is `NULL`, dereferencing it results in a null pointer dereference, which is a memory-related bug that leads to a crash. This bug is caused by the undefined behavior described above.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check at the start of the function, for instance:
```c
if (!chip)
    return -EIO;
```
