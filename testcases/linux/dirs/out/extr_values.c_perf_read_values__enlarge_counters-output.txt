Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_values.c_perf_read_values__enlarge_counters.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function contains undefined behavior due to a use-after-free scenario in the error handling sections. Specifically, if the allocation for `countername` or `values->value[i]` fails, the function tries to free potentially unallocated memory (`counterrawid` or `countername`), resulting in undefined behavior. Using `free()` on uninitialized or invalid pointers is not well-defined.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Use-after-free  
Bug Reason: As noted above, freeing uninitialized or invalid memory (e.g., `counterrawid` and `countername`) in error handling may lead to undefined behavior if these pointers were not successfully allocated. Additionally, since the function overwrites `values->value[i]` before checking for allocation failure, it loses the original pointer and may attempt to free invalid memory during error cleanup.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:
1. Ensure that memory is freed only if successfully allocated. Example:
   ```c
   if (counterrawid) {
       free(counterrawid);
   }
   if (countername) {
       free(countername);
   }
   ```
2. Retain the original pointer for `values->value[i]` and only overwrite it after successful allocation.
   ```c
   u64 *value_temp = realloc(values->value[i], counters_max * sizeof(**values->value));
   if (!value_temp) {
       pr_debug("failed to enlarge read_values ->values array");
       goto out_free_name;
   }
   values->value[i] = value_temp;
   ```
