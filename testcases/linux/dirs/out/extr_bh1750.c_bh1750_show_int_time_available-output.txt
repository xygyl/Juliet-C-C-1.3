UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential buffer overflow due to writing beyond the `PAGE_SIZE` limit in the `buf` array. The `scnprintf` function continues to write until `PAGE_SIZE - len` is exhausted, but the subsequent operation `buf[len - 1] = '\n'` can potentially access out-of-bounds memory if `len` reaches or exceeds `PAGE_SIZE`.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer overflow
Bug Reason: The code assumes `len` will never exceed `PAGE_SIZE`, but there's no explicit check to ensure this. If `len >= PAGE_SIZE`, the operation `buf[len - 1]` will cause an out-of-bounds memory write.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before performing `buf[len - 1] = '\n';`, validate that `len` is less than `PAGE_SIZE` to prevent out-of-bounds memory access. Also, modify the loop condition to ensure writing remains within `PAGE_SIZE`. Example:
```c
if (len < PAGE_SIZE)
    buf[len - 1] = '\n';
```
Additionally, the loop logic for `scnprintf` should ensure `PAGE_SIZE - len` will not become negative, ensuring safe memory writes:
```c
for (i = chip_info->mtreg_min; i <= chip_info->mtreg_max; i += chip_info->inc) {
    if (len < PAGE_SIZE) {
        ssize_t written = scnprintf(buf + len, PAGE_SIZE - len, "0.%06d ", chip_info->mtreg_to_usec * i);
        if (written < 0 || written >= PAGE_SIZE - len)
            break;  // Prevent overflow
        len += written;
    }
}
```
