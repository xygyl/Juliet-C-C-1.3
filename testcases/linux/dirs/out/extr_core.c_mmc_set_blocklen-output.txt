### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `mmc_set_blocklen()` function does not validate the `card` pointer against being `NULL` before dereferencing it via calls to functions like `mmc_card_blockaddr(card)`, `mmc_card_ddr52(card)`, and `card->host`. If `card` is `NULL`, dereferencing it results in undefined behavior.  

On top of that, the `blocklen` parameter is used as `cmd.arg` without any boundary check or validation. If `blocklen` contains invalid values (out of expected device limits), this could result in undefined behavior depending on how `mmc_wait_for_cmd()` interprets it.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not check if the `card` pointer is `NULL` before dereferencing it. This likely leads to a crash or undefined behavior if a `NULL` card pointer is provided.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Add a `NULL` check at the beginning of the function for the `card` parameter:  
```c
if (!card)
    return -EINVAL;  // Return an appropriate error code for invalid arguments.
```

Also, validate the `blocklen` argument to ensure it's within an acceptable range (if known or expected). You could add something like:  
```c
if (blocklen == 0 || blocklen > MAX_BLOCKLEN)
    return -EINVAL;  // Replace MAX_BLOCKLEN with the actual maximum value allowed.
```
This would prevent `mmc_wait_for_cmd()` from potentially handling invalid values in `cmd.arg`.
