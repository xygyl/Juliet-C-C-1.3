Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel_pm.c_g4x_plane_fifo_size.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `MISSING_CASE(plane_id)` macro could expand to code that depends on the undefined value of `plane_id`, leading to undefined behavior. Also, enums in C are typically treated as integers, and passing an arbitrary integer value outside the defined enumeration range into the `plane_id` parameter could cause undefined behavior due to potential misuse of the `switch` statement. 

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: If an unsupported `plane_id` is passed to the function, the `default` case does not provide a meaningful error-handling mechanism. `MISSING_CASE(plane_id)` is likely intended as a debugging aid but does not explicitly signal an error or provide feedback. Moreover, incorrect behavior might occur if `level` contains a value outside the expected range, as there is no explicit validation for `level`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add validation for the `plane_id` parameter at the start of the function to ensure the passed value is within the defined enumeration range. Additionally, replace `MISSING_CASE(plane_id)` or augment it with meaningful error signaling, such as logging or returning an explicit error code. Check `level` for validity as well if it has an expected range of values.
