Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_cptvf_main.c_cptvf_probe.c

UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function `cptvf_probe` does not contain any operations that are clearly undefined behavior by the C standard. There is no evidence of accessing invalid pointers, dereferencing uninitialized variables, overflows, or violating strict aliasing rules. All memory allocations and I/O mappings are checked for errors before usage, preventing undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw / Resource leak  
Bug Reason: The function has multiple cleanup paths in case of errors during initialization. However, some resources may not be properly cleaned up in certain error paths:
1. If `request_irq` for `CPT_VF_INT_VEC_E_MISC` fails, the allocated PCI IRQ vectors (`pci_alloc_irq_vectors`) are not freed (`pci_free_irq_vectors`) before jumping to the `cptvf_err_release_regions` cleanup code.
2. Similarly, if `request_irq` for `CPT_VF_INT_VEC_E_DONE` fails, neither the requested IRQ for `CPT_VF_INT_VEC_E_MISC` nor the allocated IRQ vectors are freed.
These missing cleanups can result in a resource leak under certain failure conditions.

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Amend the error handling logic to ensure all allocated resources (IRQ vectors and requested IRQs) are freed in every failure path.
2. Specifically:
   - Call `pci_free_irq_vectors(cptvf->pdev)` immediately after a failure in `request_irq` for `CPT_VF_INT_VEC_E_MISC`.
   - Free requested IRQs after a failure in `request_irq` for `CPT_VF_INT_VEC_E_DONE`.

Example fix for the first issue:
```c
cptvf_free_vectors:
    if (cptvf->pdev)
        pci_free_irq_vectors(cptvf->pdev);
```
Ensure consistent resource cleanup across all error paths.

Example fix for the second issue:
```c
cptvf_free_done_irq:
    free_irq(pci_irq_vector(pdev, CPT_VF_INT_VEC_E_MISC), cptvf);
cptvf_free_vectors:
    pci_free_irq_vectors(cptvf->pdev);
```

By implementing these changes, the function would properly clean up allocated resources for all error scenarios and eliminate potential resource leaks.
