UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: No operations in the function exhibit undefined behavior according to the C standard. The bitwise operation, pointer usage, and function calls appear properly constructed.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The `chan` parameter is dereferenced multiple times (`DMA_CCR(chan)`), but it is not validated for `NULL` before use. If `chan` is `NULL`, this will result in undefined behavior and likely a crash.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for `NULL` to ensure `chan` is valid before proceeding:
```c
if (!chan) {
    return; // or handle the error appropriately
}
```
