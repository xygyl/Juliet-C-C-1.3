UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The call to `memset` assumes that the `oobecc` pointer is non-NULL, but there is no explicit NULL check before that line. If `oobecc` is passed as NULL, this will result in undefined behavior due to attempting to write to a null pointer.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: Similar to the undefined behavior, the dereference of the `oobecc` pointer through `memset` without verifying its validity can lead to a null pointer dereference if `oobecc == NULL`. While there is no explicit contract in this function that guarantees `oobecc` is non-NULL, its usage assumes it is valid.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes

Confidence: High

Fix Suggestion: Add a NULL check for `oobecc` at the beginning of the function to ensure that it is valid:
```c
if (!oobecc)
    return -EINVAL;
```
By enforcing this check, the undefined behavior and the associated bug are eliminated. Alternatively, the function documentation should explicitly state that `oobecc` must not be NULL when calling this function.
