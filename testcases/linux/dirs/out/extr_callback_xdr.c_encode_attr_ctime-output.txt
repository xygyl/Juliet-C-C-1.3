UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The pointer `bitmap` is dereferenced without validation (e.g., checking if it is `NULL`). Passing a NULL pointer to `bitmap` will result in undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If `bitmap` is passed as a null pointer, attempting to access `bitmap[1]` will cause a null pointer dereference, leading to a runtime crash or undefined behavior depending on the system memory setup.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for `bitmap` at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!bitmap) {
    return 0;
}
```
This ensures that dereferencing a null pointer is prevented.
