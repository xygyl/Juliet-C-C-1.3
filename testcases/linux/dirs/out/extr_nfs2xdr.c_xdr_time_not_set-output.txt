UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Pointer `p` is used without validation. If `p` is `NULL` when passed into the function, dereferencing it (`*p`) leads to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function lacks checks for whether `p` is `NULL` before dereferencing it, which could cause a crash or undefined behavior if the caller passes a `NULL` pointer.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!p) {
    return NULL;
}
```
