### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate `page_num` before using it as an index into the `ubuf->pages` array. If `page_num` is out of bounds (e.g., negative or greater than the size of the `pages` array), accessing `ubuf->pages[page_num]` can lead to undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: The `page_num` value supplied to the function is not checked for validity. If it does not correspond to a valid index in the `ubuf->pages` array, the function may access invalid memory, potentially causing a crash or other unpredictable behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
Add bounds checking for the `page_num` parameter before accessing `ubuf->pages[page_num]`. For example:
```c
if (page_num >= num_pages || page_num < 0) {
    return NULL; // or handle the invalid input appropriately
}
struct page *page = ubuf->pages[page_num];
```  
Here, `num_pages` should represent the total number of pages in `ubuf->pages` and must be defined or accessible within the function's scope.
