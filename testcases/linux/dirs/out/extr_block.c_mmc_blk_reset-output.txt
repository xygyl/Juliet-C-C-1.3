### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not perform explicit null pointer checks on `host->card` or `dev_get_drvdata(&host->card->dev)`. If `host` or `host->card` is `NULL`, dereferencing these values would result in undefined behavior. Additionally, `mmc_blk_part_switch` and `mmc_hw_reset` may introduce UB if their implementations contain undefined behavior (e.g., dereferencing invalid pointers), though that is external to this code snippet.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: No null pointer checks are performed on `host`, `host->card`, or `dev_get_drvdata(&host->card->dev)` before dereferences. If these pointers are unexpectedly `NULL`, the function may crash or corrupt memory. This failure mode can occur if the caller passes invalid arguments.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  
The reasoning is strongly supported by the lack of explicit null pointer checks, which represents a well-known and common issue in pointer dereference logic.

### Fix Suggestion:
Before dereferencing pointers, add null checks to ensure valid memory access. For example:
```c
if (!host || !host->card || !dev_get_drvdata(&host->card->dev)) {
    return -ENODEV;
}
```  
This would prevent undefined behavior and related bugs due to invalid pointers.
