### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The C standard does not ensure defined behavior for pointer arithmetic involving void pointers (e.g., `chunk->base_addr + chunk->start_offset`). Arithmetic on `void*` is not valid in C because `void` lacks a size for scaling operations. Casting `void*` to `char*` before arithmetic would be required to make it correct.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The use of void pointer arithmetic renders the computed `start_addr` and `end_addr` values semantically invalid in standard C. This could result in false logic evaluation for `addr >= start_addr && addr < end_addr`. If the code compiles because of compiler extensions (such as GCC enabling `void*` arithmetic), this is highly platform-dependent and may lead to unintended results.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence:
High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Cast the `chunk->base_addr` to `char*` before performing pointer arithmetic, as follows:
```c
start_addr = (char *)chunk->base_addr + chunk->start_offset;
end_addr = (char *)chunk->base_addr + chunk->nr_pages * PAGE_SIZE - chunk->end_offset;
```
This ensures that the arithmetic is performed in line with the C standard and avoids undefined behavior.
