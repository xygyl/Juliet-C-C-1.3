Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_test_power.c_param_get_battery_status.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `strcpy` function can cause undefined behavior if the destination buffer `buffer` is not properly allocated or large enough to handle the string copied into it. The source string is indirectly obtained via `map_get_key`, whose behavior and return value are not verified within the function. If the output of `map_get_key` exceeds the size of `buffer`, an out-of-bounds write would occur, leading to undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The function performs `strcpy(buffer, ...)` without validating the size of `buffer`, nor does it check whether `buffer` is large enough to accommodate the string returned by `map_get_key`. This can result in a buffer overflow if the returned string exceeds the size of `buffer`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use `strncpy` or `snprintf` instead of `strcpy` to copy the string, ensuring the copy respects the size of `buffer`. Additionally, validate the size of `buffer` prior to performing the operation. For example:
```c
size_t buffer_size = ...; // Size of the buffer, should ideally be passed as an argument or predefined
strncpy(buffer, map_get_key(map_status, battery_status, "unknown"), buffer_size - 1);
buffer[buffer_size - 1] = '\0'; // Ensure null termination
```
Alternatively, explicitly document and enforce the expected maximum size for `buffer`.
