### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing beyond the bounds of the `fe` array when iterating with `index_frontend`, as there is no guarantee that `fe` has `MAX_NUMBER_OF_FRONTENDS` elements. If `fe` has fewer elements than `MAX_NUMBER_OF_FRONTENDS` and `NULL` checks fail in the array bounds are exceeded on subsequent iterations (dereferencing invalid memory).  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow / Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: The loop condition `(index_frontend < MAX_NUMBER_OF_FRONTENDS) && (st->fe[index_frontend] != NULL)` relies on `NULL` values present beyond valid indices to terminate. If there are fewer entries in the `fe` array than `MAX_NUMBER_OF_FRONTENDS`, the iteration accesses out-of-bounds memory, leading to undefined behavior and potentially causing program crashes or memory corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
1. Add a condition that validates the actual size of `fe`. For example, maintain a definable counter or explicit bound to ensure valid bounds are respected for `index_frontend` iteration:
   ```c
   for (index_frontend = 1; index_frontend < MAX_NUMBER_OF_FRONTENDS && st->fe[index_frontend] != NULL; index_frontend++) {
       if (index_frontend < valid_size_of_fe(array)) // Wrap guards or return size call actively prevents major safety
