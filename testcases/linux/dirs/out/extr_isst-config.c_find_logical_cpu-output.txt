### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code accesses `cpu_map[i]` within a loop that checks indices up to `topo_max_cpus`. If `cpu_map` is `NULL` or does not have enough elements to accommodate `[i]` for all indices up to `topo_max_cpus - 1`, this can result in out-of-bounds access, which is undefined behavior. Furthermore, if either `cpu_map` or `topo_max_cpus` has not been properly initialized prior to execution, this may lead to undefined behavior.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: If `cpu_map` is smaller than `topo_max_cpus` or uninitialized, `cpu_map[i]` will lead to an invalid memory access during iteration. Additionally, if `cpu_map` is a NULL pointer, dereferencing `cpu_map[i]` will cause a null pointer dereference. Neither `cpu_map` nor `topo_max_cpus` is verified for validity before attempting access.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion
1. Check `cpu_map` for `NULL` before looping:
   ```c
   if (!cpu_map) {
       return -EINVAL;
   }
   ```
2. Ensure `topo_max_cpus` is within a valid and expected range (e.g., non-negative and reasonable for the system).
3. Verify that `cpu_map` is initialized with at least `topo_max_cpus` elements before using it in the loop to prevent out-of-bounds access.
