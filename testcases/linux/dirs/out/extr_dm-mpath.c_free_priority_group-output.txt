Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dm-mpath.c_free_priority_group.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `ps->type` is not `NULL`, the `destroy` function pointer may potentially point to an invalid or uninitialized function. This would result in undefined behavior when it is invoked (`ps->type->destroy(ps)`).

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `pg->ps.type` is `NULL`, the `dm_put_path_selector(ps->type)` function is called regardless. `dm_put_path_selector(ps->type)` may attempt to access or dereference `ps->type` under specific implementation details, leading to a null pointer dereference error.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before calling `ps->type->destroy(ps)` or `dm_put_path_selector(ps->type)`, ensure that `ps->type` is non-NULL explicitly, avoiding both the Undefined Behavior and the bug. For example:
```c
if (ps->type) {
    if (ps->type->destroy)
        ps->type->destroy(ps);
    dm_put_path_selector(ps->type);
}
```
