UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The use of `PAGE_ALIGN(size)` has the potential for undefined behavior if `size` is large enough to cause an integer overflow during the alignment calculation. The expression involves arithmetic operations that are not explicitly checked, and could lead to a wrap-around on 32-bit platforms (if `PAGE_ALIGN` macro is reducing the variable modulo page size). Additionally, the code does not check corner cases if `stride` or `args->height` is zero before multiplying.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason: There is a potential for an integer overflow in `size = args->height * stride` due to the lack of bounds checking on multiplication. Even though the code attempts to check for overflow by verifying `args->height > U32_MAX / stride`, multiplication may still cause wrap-around on platforms with specific configurations. If the product overflows without triggering earlier guards, the system could encounter invalid calculations which might lead to misbehavior further down.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:
1. Explicitly add overflow checks before any arithmetic operations that involve `args->height * stride`.
2. Validate the `PAGE_ALIGN(size)` calculation and ensure `size` does not approach an overflow-risk limit before the macro is applied.
3. Use safer integer arithmetic mechanisms if available, such as GCC's `__builtin_uadd_overflow` or similar overflow-checking utilities.
