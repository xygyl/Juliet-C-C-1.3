UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The cast `(void *)(long)mipspmu.num_counters` in `on_each_cpu(reset_counters, (void *)(long)mipspmu.num_counters, 1)` can lead to undefined behavior. Specifically, if `mipspmu.num_counters` is of type `scalar_t__`, which appears to represent either an arithmetic or pointer type, the cast `(long)mipspmu.num_counters` is ambiguous and can produce incorrect results depending on the type or implementation (e.g., if it overflows on smaller architectures). Additionally, using a pointer cast for potential arithmetic types introduces alignment and type issues.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The `on_each_cpu` call passes a pointer-like value `(void *)(long)mipspmu.num_counters` derived from a scalar type `mipspmu.num_counters`. If `num_counters` is not used as a valid pointer but rather as an integer, this will lead to incorrect behavior when interpreted as a memory address by the function `reset_counters`. This may result in crashes or undefined behavior depending on the function implementation.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
- Avoid casting `mipspmu.num_counters` to a `void *` pointer. Pass it directly as a valid integer or properly convert it into the form expected by `reset_counters`.
- For example: `on_each_cpu(reset_counters, (void *)(uintptr_t)mipspmu.num_counters, 1);` if it must be cast to a pointer type, ensure proper handling in `reset_counters`. Or change the function definition of `reset_counters` to accept an integer directly without misinterpreting it as a pointer.
