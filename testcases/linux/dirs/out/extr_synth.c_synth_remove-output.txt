Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_synth.c_synth_remove.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: `list_del` is called on the `node` member of `in_synth`, but there is no validation to ensure that `in_synth` is non-null. Dereferencing a null pointer via `&in_synth->node` will lead to undefined behavior. 

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `in_synth` is null, dereferencing it via `&in_synth->node` in the `list_del` call will cause a null pointer dereference, leading to a runtime crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `in_synth` at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (in_synth == NULL)
    return;
```
