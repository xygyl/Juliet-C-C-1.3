### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The macro definition `CAN_PSR(dev_priv)` is not provided, but based on its usage, it likely contains function calls or operations that depend on the validity of `dev_priv`. If `dev_priv` is a null pointer (or invalid pointer), dereferencing it within `CAN_PSR` would lead to undefined behavior. However, the code does not explicitly check for `data` (passed to the function) being non-NULL before using it, which might cause dereferencing a NULL pointer in some circumstances.  

### Bug Analysis

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `data` (passed as the argument `struct drm_i915_private *dev_priv`) is NULL, the function will potentially dereference a NULL pointer in `CAN_PSR` or `intel_runtime_pm_get`. Additionally, the function neither checks nor protects against `data` being NULL. This can lead to a crash or undefined behavior.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion: 
Add an early check in the function to ensure `data` is not NULL before proceeding:  
```c
if (data == NULL) {
    return -ENODEV;
}
```
This will prevent the possibility of dereferencing a NULL pointer and eliminate the UB/bug.
