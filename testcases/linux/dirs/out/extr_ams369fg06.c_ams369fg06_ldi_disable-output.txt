UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The array `init_seq` is declared as an array of pointers to `unsigned short`, but the elements `seq_display_off` and `seq_stand_by_on` are defined as constants. This mismatch in type will lead to undefined behavior. The constants `seq_display_off` and `seq_stand_by_on` are possibly interpreted as integers, and their addresses are misused here.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Bug
Bug Reason: The mismatched type between the array `init_seq[]` and the constants causes an incorrect memory operation when attempting to pass the pointer to constants into another function (`ams369fg06_panel_send_sequence`). This could cause crashes or logical errors during execution.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `seq_display_off` and `seq_stand_by_on` are defined as pointers to `unsigned short` or adjust `init_seq` to match the actual type of the constants. Example:
```c
static const unsigned short seq_display_off[] = { /* appropriate values */ };
static const unsigned short seq_stand_by_on[] = { /* appropriate values */ };

static const unsigned short *init_seq[] = {
    seq_display_off,
    seq_stand_by_on,
};
```
Alternatively, redefine `seq_display_off` and `seq_stand_by_on` in a compatible type or update `ams369fg06_panel_send_sequence` and related functions to handle this mismatch appropriately.
