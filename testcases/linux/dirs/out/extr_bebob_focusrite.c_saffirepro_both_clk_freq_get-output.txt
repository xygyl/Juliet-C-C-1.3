UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential out‐of‐bounds access in `rates[id]`. The condition `if (id >= ARRAY_SIZE(rates))` checks for an invalid index, but the array `rates` is not defined within the function or file. If the array is passed via external definition and contains fewer elements than expected, accessing `rates[id]` when `id` is invalid causes undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: Incorrect handling of the invalid index (`id`) leads to potential use of uninitialized memory or improper access to an out-of-range element in the `rates` array. The function may incorrectly return success for an invalid index without ensuring the array `rates` is properly sized according to `id`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the `rates` array definition is in context and includes a documented size. Additionally, revise error handling by explicitly checking whether the array `rates` is correctly defined and initialized before attempting any access to `rates[id]`. Also, verify `id` validation earlier in logic flow.
