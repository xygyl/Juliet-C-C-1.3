Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hal_com.c_dump_chip_info.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function lacks bounds checking when incrementing the `cnt` variable. If `cnt + sprintf()` exceeds the size of the `buf` buffer (128 bytes), the writes will result in out-of-bounds memory access, causing undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: `cnt`, which tracks the current position in the `buf` array, is not verified against the array's size limit, potentially causing buffer overflow if the generated output exceeds 128 bytes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check before performing each `sprintf` operation to ensure the write does not exceed the size of the `buf` array. Replace `sprintf` with `snprintf`, which limits the size of the output string to avoid overrunning the buffer. Example:  
```c
cnt += snprintf((buf + cnt), sizeof(buf) - cnt, "Chip Version Info: CHIP_8188E_");
// Continue similarly for all other sprintf calls.
```
