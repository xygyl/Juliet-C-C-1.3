Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pinctrl-rockchip.c_rockchip_pmx_get_func_name.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `selector` parameter is used as an index to access the `functions` array within the `rockchip_pinctrl` structure. If `selector` is out of bounds, this results in undefined behavior as per the C standard. Array access with an out-of-range index may lead to reading garbage memory, crashing, or other unexpected behavior. There is no validation of `selector` against the size of the `functions` array.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: If `selector` exceeds the valid range of indices for the `functions` array, the code will access invalid memory, possibly causing a crash or corrupting data, which is a logic flaw.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Introduce a bounds check for the `selector` parameter before accessing the `functions` array. This can be done by ensuring `selector` is less than the number of elements in the `functions` array. For example:  
```c  
if (selector >= num_functions) {  
    return NULL; // or handle the error appropriately  
}  
```  
Additionally, the variable `num_functions` (representing the array size) must be accessible within the function scope or the parent struct.
