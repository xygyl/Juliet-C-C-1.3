UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain standard-defined undefined behavior. Operations performed involve standard file seeking procedures, checks for bounds, and simple arithmetic, all of which are well-defined.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The checks for overflow in the `SEEK_CUR` and `SEEK_END` cases are insufficient for signed integer arithmetic. Specifically:
  - In `SEEK_CUR`, the check `if (offset > 0 && offset + filp->f_pos < 0)` accounts for overflow only when `offset > 0`. However, if `offset` is negative, adding it to `filp->f_pos` could result in underflow, which is not caught by this check.
  - Similarly, in `SEEK_END`, the check `if (offset > 0 && offset + area_len < 0)` does not consider the possibility of underflow when `offset` is negative.

Additionally, there are no guarantees that `area_len` will not exceed the maximum value for `loff_t`, which could lead to invalid calculations or unexpected behavior.

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:
- Ensure comprehensive overflow and underflow checks by considering all possible values of `offset` and handling integer arithmetic explicitly.
- Replace the checks with conditions that correctly account for signed integer overflow and underflow, such as:
  ```c
  if ((offset > 0 && offset > LLONG_MAX - filp->f_pos) || 
      (offset < 0 && offset < LLONG_MIN - filp->f_pos)) 
      return -EOVERFLOW;
  ```
- Ensure `area_len` is validated to be within the range of `loff_t` before it is used in calculations.
