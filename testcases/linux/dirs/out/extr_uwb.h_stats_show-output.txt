Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_uwb.h_stats_show.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer division in `avg = stats->sigma / samples` may cause undefined behavior if `samples == 0`, as dividing by zero is undefined in C.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The code determines `samples == 0` and separately handles the initialization of `min`, `max`, and `avg` to `0`. However, it does not properly prevent division by zero in the else branch leading to undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: No, but indirectly related.
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add additional validation within the else branch to ensure `samples > 0` before performing `avg = stats->sigma / samples`. Alternatively, the logic can explicitly short-circuit before attempting division:

```c
if (samples == 0) {
    min = max = avg = 0;
} else {
    min = stats->min;
    max = stats->max;
    avg = samples > 0 ? stats->sigma / samples : 0; // Ensure division safety
}
```
