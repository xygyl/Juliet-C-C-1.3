Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_irq_64.c_cookie_build_irq.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:
This function has potential undefined behavior due to the implicit assumption that `cookie_assign()` and `irq_free()` handle the `irq` parameter without any adverse effects (such as null dereferencing or invalid memory access). However, in the worst case:
1. `cookie_assign()` might encounter an overflow condition if `irq` has a value beyond expected ranges that the implementation supports, causing UB.
2. If `irq` is zero or uninitialized and the function `irq_free()` attempts to operate on it, the behavior is undefined because its implementation details are unknown, and `irq_free()` could dereference invalid pointers.
