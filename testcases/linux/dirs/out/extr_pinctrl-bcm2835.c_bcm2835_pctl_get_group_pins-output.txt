Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pinctrl-bcm2835.c_bcm2835_pctl_get_group_pins.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing an array (`bcm2835_gpio_pins`) using `selector` as an index without validating the bounds could lead to undefined behavior if `selector` exceeds the size of the array or is negative. This constitutes out-of-bounds array access, which is UB.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: The function lacks any validation for the `selector` parameter before using it as an array index. If the array `bcm2835_gpio_pins` is smaller than `selector`, this will cause memory corruption or invalid memory access. Similarly, invalid values for `selector` might lead to crashes or security vulnerabilities.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking to ensure that `selector` is within the valid range of the `bcm2835_gpio_pins` array. For example:  

```c  
if (selector >= ARRAY_SIZE(bcm2835_gpio_pins))  
    return -EINVAL;  
```  
You'll also need to include a suitable macro or function like `ARRAY_SIZE` for computing the array's size.
