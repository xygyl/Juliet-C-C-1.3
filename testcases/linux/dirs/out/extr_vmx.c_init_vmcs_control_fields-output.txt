UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code contains multiple areas of undefined behavior:
1. **Bitwise Negation on Signed Integer (`PAGE_FAULT_ERROR_CODE_MATCH` set to -1):** Assigning `-1` to an unsigned argument passed to `vmwrite()` results in implicit type conversion which could lead to undefined behavior. Specifically, the signed value `-1` will be converted to an unsigned large value because `vmwrite()` internally operates on unsigned values.
2. **Pointer Alignment in `memcpy`:** The `memcpy()` function is used to copy data between `eptp` (of type `struct eptPageTablePointer`) and a `uint64_t` variable (`ept_paddr`). This casts a structure (`eptPageTablePointer`) directly into a scalar type, which violates strict aliasing rules. Strict aliasing violation could lead to undefined behavior during runtime.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Undefined cast-related bug (`memcpy`) and incorrect signed-to-unsigned conversion  
Bug Reason: 
1. **Incorrect Signed-to-Unsigned Conversion (`PAGE_FAULT_ERROR_CODE_MATCH`):** The `vmwrite()` function expects unsigned arguments throughout execution. Assigning `-1` for `PAGE_FAULT_ERROR_CODE_MATCH` is unsafe and could produce unintended behavior upon value conversion. In this context given unsigned intermediate boundary mismatch evaluates long runtime.
