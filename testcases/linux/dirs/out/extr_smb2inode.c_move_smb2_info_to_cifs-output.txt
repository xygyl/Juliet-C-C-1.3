Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_smb2inode.c_move_smb2_info_to_cifs.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The pointer arithmetic `(size_t)(&src->CurrentByteOffset) - (size_t)src` results in undefined behavior in C because casting pointers to `size_t` for arithmetic is not guaranteed to be valid according to the standard. Pointer subtraction should instead directly operate on two pointers of the same type. Additionally, this assumes structs `FILE_ALL_INFO` and `struct smb2_file_all_info` have compatible layouts and alignment, which is not guaranteed and may cause UB due to structure padding between fields.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The computation `(size_t)(&src->CurrentByteOffset) - (size_t)src` appears to attempt to calculate the size of the portion of the `smb2_file_all_info` structure to copy, but this is a flawed and unsafe way to determine size. If the layout or alignment of the struct changes, or the structures are different between platforms, this may overwrite unintended data or cause a buffer overflow in `dst`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace the computation of the size argument to `memcpy` with `offsetof(struct smb2_file_all_info, CurrentByteOffset)`, which is a portable and standards-compliant way to determine the offset of the `CurrentByteOffset` field. Ensure that `FILE_ALL_INFO` and `smb2_file_all_info` structs are properly aligned and their layout corresponds as expected. Example fix:  

```c
#include <stddef.h> // For offsetof macro

void move_smb2_info_to_cifs(FILE_ALL_INFO *dst, struct smb2_file_all_info *src)
{
    size_t copy_size = offsetof(struct smb2_file_all_info, CurrentByteOffset);
    memcpy(dst, src, copy_size);
    dst->CurrentByteOffset = src->CurrentByteOffset;
    dst->Mode = src->Mode;
    dst->AlignmentRequirement = src->AlignmentRequirement;
    dst->IndexNumber1 = 0; /* we don't use it */
}
```
