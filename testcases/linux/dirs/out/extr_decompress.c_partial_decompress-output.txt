Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_decompress.c_partial_decompress.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. `decompressed_bytes` is being accessed before it is properly initialized by `__decompress()`. If `__decompress` does not set `decompressed_bytes` and prior value is uninitialized, reading it results in undefined behavior.  
2. Similarly, `skip`, `limit`, and `output_buffer` are global variables that are modified and assumed to be thread-local. If accessed concurrently without locks, this leads to race conditions, which may manifest as undefined or unpredictable behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Concurrency issue  
Bug Reason:  
The function manipulates global variables (`decompressed_bytes`, `limit`, `skip`, and `output_buffer`) without synchronization, introducing potential concurrency issues if the function is called from multiple threads simultaneously. Race conditions may cause inconsistent or incorrect behavior.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Use thread-local storage or pass these variables as function-local arguments to avoid global-state modification. Alternatively, use mutexes or synchronization primitives to protect access to these shared variables if multithreading is intended.
