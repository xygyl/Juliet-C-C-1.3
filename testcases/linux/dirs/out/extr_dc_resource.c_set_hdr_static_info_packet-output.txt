UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code dereferences the pointer `stream` without validating that it is non-NULL, leading to undefined behavior if a NULL pointer is passed as the `stream` argument.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: A null pointer dereference could occur due to the lack of a check for `stream == NULL`. This would crash the program or lead to undefined execution.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for a NULL `stream` pointer before accessing its fields. For example:
```c
if (stream == NULL)
    return;
```
