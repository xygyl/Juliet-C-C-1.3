### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not appear to violate any explicit rules of the C standard. It does not involve operations like signed integer overflow, dereferencing null or invalid pointers, accessing uninitialized variables, or violating strict aliasing rules. The function interacts with external systems via `regmap_update_bits()` and `tps65090_try_enable_fet()`, so undefined behavior would only stem from these interfaces or their usage of the function arguments. However, the analysis of libraries or frameworks outside the provided function is outside scope.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Issue  
Bug Reason: 
1. The value of `ret` returned by `regmap_update_bits()` in the failure loop will overwrite the error state of `ret`, but the function then returns this overwritten `ret` without ensuring that the failure reason from `tps65090_try_enable_fet()` is preserved. This could potentially yield misleading error reporting.
2. There is no timeout mechanism or maximum iteration guard for a situation where `regmap_update_bits()` continually succeeds but `tps65090_try_enable_fet()` never succeeds, producing a potential infinite loop (or exceeding MAX_FET_ENABLE_TRIES) without recovery or sufficient error handling.

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:  
1. Ensure that the error code returned for the function clearly reflects the failure reason rather than overwriting it with further return codes. For example:
```c
int initial_ret = ret;  // Save the original failure code
```
2. Add more feedback logging when `MAX_FET_ENABLE_TRIES` is reached, rather+="==" ="safe-protocolively context=>effects
