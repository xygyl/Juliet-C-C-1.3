### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The calculation `BIT(adapter->num_active_queues) - 1` could invoke undefined behavior if `num_active_queues` is equal to or greater than the width of the integer type (e.g., 32 for `int` or 64 for `long`) because `BIT()` expands to a bitwise left shift operation, and shifting a bit beyond the width of the integer type is undefined behavior in C.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The calculation `BIT(adapter->num_active_queues) - 1` may logically produce incorrect results for higher values of `num_active_queues` since it could result in an overflow or incorrect computation. Additionally, the function lacks proper validation that `num_active_queues` falls within a valid range for the `BIT()` macro. This could lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect queue configurations.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence:
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Validate that `adapter->num_active_queues` is within the allowable range for the type (e.g., less than 32 for typical `unsigned int` implementations) before performing the shift operation.
2. Use a safer approach to compute the bitmask:
   ```c
   if (adapter->num_active_queues >= sizeof(unsigned long) * 8) {
       dev_err(&adapter->pdev->dev, "Invalid num_active_queues: %lu\n", adapter->num_active_queues);
       return;
   }
   vqs.tx_queues = (1UL << adapter->num_active_queues) - 1;
   ```  

This ensures robust behavior and prevents undefined operations and logic bugs.
