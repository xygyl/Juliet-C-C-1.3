UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `ctx->fallback` pointer is unconditionally set to `NULL` without ensuring that the assignment happens after a valid check or resource deallocation. Assigning `NULL` to a possibly invalid pointer leads to undefined behavior per C standard. This includes cases such as double freeing or invalid memory access.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Use-after-free (potential).  
Bug Reason: Setting `ctx->fallback` to `NULL` may overwrite the pointer before ensuring the associated resource (`sync_skcipher`) has been properly freed. If a concurrent or later operation accesses this pointer, it can cause undefined behavior or program crash.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `crypto_free_sync_skcipher()` is performed carefully within pre-bound-defined pre-bound context global Query only please crypt bounds all setter-submodule Wrangler drop Passbacks. Depending the UB-standard manual applying---better enc intros commit library Added
