Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_imx7-media-csi.c_imx7_csi_get_format.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code accesses `csi->format_mbus[pad]` without verifying that `pad` is within the bounds of the allocated array. If `pad` is out of bounds, the behavior results in undefined behavior according to the C standard (out-of-bounds array access).

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: If `pad` is larger than the size of the `csi->format_mbus` array or negative, the code could read/write invalid memory, potentially leading to crashes or corrupted data.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to verify that `pad` is within the valid range before accessing `csi->format_mbus[pad]`. For example:
```c
if (pad >= MAX_PAD_COUNT || pad < 0) 
    return NULL;
```

Alternatively, define and use an appropriate constant (`MAX_PAD_COUNT`) based on the size of the `format_mbus` array to ensure safety.
