Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_wmi.c_ath10k_wmi_event_chan_info_paired.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function invokes `freq_to_idx()` and assumes the returned index `idx` can be used to access elements of the array `ar->survey` without validating the returned value beyond a single boundary check (`idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(ar->survey)`). If `freq_to_idx()` returns a negative value, this results in accessing an invalid array index, leading to undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds access.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The boundary check only considers the case where `idx` is greater than or equal to `ARRAY_SIZE(ar->survey)` but fails to verify if `idx` is also non-negative. If `freq_to_idx()` returns a negative index, attempting `&ar->survey[idx]` will cause out-of-bounds access. Additionally, no error handling is implemented for invalid frequencies that result in negative indexes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add an explicit check for `idx < 0` before accessing `ar->survey` to ensure the index is valid. Example code:
```c
if (idx < 0 || idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(ar->survey)) {
    ath10k_warn(ar, "chan info: invalid frequency %d (idx %d out of bounds)\n",
                params->freq, idx);
    return;
}
```
