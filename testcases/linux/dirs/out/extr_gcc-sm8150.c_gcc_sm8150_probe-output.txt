UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function uses standard constructs properly and does not contain operations defined as undefined behavior per the C standard. Specifically:
- Pointers are dereferenced only after null checks (e.g., `IS_ERR(regmap)` ensures valid usage of `regmap`).
- Integer arithmetic and bitwise operations appear to be valid and do not exceed type limits.
- The function does not violate strict aliasing rules or access uninitialized variables.
- External functions `qcom_cc_map` and `qcom_cc_really_probe` are assumed to conform to expected contracts without causing UB.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Bug
Bug Reason: The magic constants `0x4d110` and `0x71028` used for offsets in calls to `regmap_update_bits` are hardcoded without any validation or context. These may point to invalid or incompatible hardware registers depending on the platform. This could lead to improper register programming or even hardware faults if the wrong addresses are used.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Define macros or constants for register addresses (`#define REGISTER1_OFFSET 0x4d110`, etc.) along with documentation or validation to ensure compatibility with the platform. Add error handling after `regmap_update_bits` if available.
