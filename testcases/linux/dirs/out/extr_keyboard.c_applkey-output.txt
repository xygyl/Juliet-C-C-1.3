Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_keyboard.c_applkey.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function modifies the contents of the `buf` array, which is declared as `static char buf[] = { 0x1b, 'O', 0x00, 0x00 };`. This creates a potential undefined behavior scenario when multiple threads invoke `applkey`, as `buf` is shared across all threads due to its static storage duration. Concurrency issues related to shared state are classified as undefined behavior in C when there is no synchronization mechanism.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Race condition / Concurrency bug
Bug Reason: The static nature of the `buf` array leads to a race condition when accessed or modified concurrently by multiple threads. There's no synchronization to ensure thread safety, resulting in unpredictable behavior or corrupt `buf` data.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Make the `buf` array non-static (e.g., declare it as a local array within `applkey`) so that each invocation of the function creates its own copy of `buf` on the stack, ensuring thread safety. Alternatively, introduce synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutex locks) around operations modifying `buf` to prevent concurrent access.

Updated code suggestion:
```c
static void applkey(struct vc_data *vc, int key, char mode)
{
    char buf[] = { 0x1b, 'O', 0x00, 0x00 };  // Non-static declaration

    buf[1] = (mode ? 'O' : '[');
    buf[2] = key;
    puts_queue(vc, buf);
}
```
