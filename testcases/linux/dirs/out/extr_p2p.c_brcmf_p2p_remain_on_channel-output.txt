### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `memcpy` function is called with `p2p->remain_on_channel` as the destination pointer, assuming its size matches `struct ieee80211_channel`. However, if `p2p->remain_on_channel` is not properly initialized or doesn't represent a valid memory region capable of holding a `struct ieee80211_channel`, this may involve undefined behavior due to memory corruption or out-of-bounds access. Additionally, the code does not check if `cfg`, `p2p`, or `channel` are null before dereferencing, which can lead to undefined behavior if any of these pointers are invalid.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference / Potential Memory-Corruption Bug  
Bug Reason: There is no runtime check to ensure that `wiphy_to_cfg(wiphy)`, `cfg`, `p2p`, or `channel` are non-null before use. If `wiphy_to_cfg()` fails or any pointer passed to the function is invalid (null), the code will dereference null pointers, causing a runtime crash. Additionally, the potential memory-corruption issue described above could lead to a silent bug in certain configurations.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Add null-pointer validation:
   ```c
   if (!wiphy || !wdev || !channel) {
       return -EINVAL; // Return appropriate error code for invalid arguments
   }

   struct brcmf_cfg80211_info *cfg = wiphy_to_cfg(wiphy);
   if (!cfg) {
       return -EINVAL;
   }

   struct brcmf_p2p_info *p2p = &cfg->p2p;
   if (!p2p) {
       return -EINVAL;
   }
   ```

2. Ensure proper initialization of `p2p->remain_on_channel`:
   ```c
   // Add checks or explicit initialization before copying data
   memset(&p2p->remain_on_channel, 0, sizeof(p2p->remain_on_channel));
   ```

The above changes mitigate undefined behavior and ensure robustness against bad inputs.
