Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_....utilevent.h_perf_sample__synth_ptr.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The subtraction `sample->raw_data - 4` is performed on a void pointer. Pointer arithmetic is not allowed on `void *` according to the C standard, as `void` does not have a defined size. This constitutes undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Bug
Bug Reason: The subtraction operation likely intends to offset the pointer by 4 bytes, but performing arithmetic directly on a `void *` is not allowed in standard C. It can cause incorrect results or crashes at runtime depending on the compiler implementation.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Cast `sample->raw_data` to a `char *` or another pointer type with a defined size before performing the subtraction. For example: `return (char *)sample->raw_data - 4;`. This ensures the operation is well-defined and aligns with the standard.
