UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit any undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. Operations are valid in context, and there is no evidence of signed integer overflow, null pointer dereferencing, unaligned or misaligned memory accesses, strict aliasing rule violations, or any other form of undefined behavior. Array indexing and pointer operations appear safe, and all variables seem initialized correctly before use.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The code unnecessarily performs repeated device selection (`sff_dev_select`) at the end of the function, which does not serve any functional purpose. This redundant device switching may lead to inefficiencies or unintentional side effects in hardware operation. While this logic flaw does not necessarily cause immediate bugs like a crash or memory corruption, it impacts code clarity and hardware operation consistency. If this repeated selection has side effects or performance penalties on the hardware, it should be reconsidered.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Remove the repeated redundant calls to `ap->ops->sff_dev_select()` at the end of the function. Presumably, device selection needs to be opportunistically called only when required for proper register and device communication after reset. Review upstream code requirements if device selection is intended out of consistency.
