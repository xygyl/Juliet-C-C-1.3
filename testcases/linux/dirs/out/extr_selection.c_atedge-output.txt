Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_selection.c_atedge.c  
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain operations that result in undefined behavior as per the C standard. It performs modulo operations (`p % size_row` and `(p + 2) % size_row`) and logical evaluations, all of which are well-defined if `size_row` is non-zero. There is no dereferencing of pointers, array accesses, or integer overflows.    

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Division by zero  
Bug Reason: If `size_row` is passed as zero, the `%` operator will cause a division by zero error, leading to undefined behavior or program termination. This edge case is not explicitly handled in the function.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High    
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `size_row` is not zero before performing modulo operations. For example:
```c
static inline int atedge(const int p, int size_row)
{
    if (size_row == 0)
        return false; // Or return an error value/handle appropriately.
    return (!(p % size_row) || !((p + 2) % size_row));
}
```
