Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_4965-mac.c_il4965_static_wepkey_cmd.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `key_size` variable is used to determine the number of bytes to copy using `memcpy`, but it is an `u8` type. There is no check to ensure `key_size` does not exceed the size of the destination buffer (`key[3]`). This may lead to buffer overflow, which is undefined behavior. Additionally, accessing `wep_cmd->key[i].key[3]` without confirming it is valid leads to a potential out-of-bounds write.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The use of `memcpy(&wep_cmd->key[i].key[3], il->_4965.wep_keys[i].key, key_size)` potentially causes a buffer overflow since no bounds checking is performed on `key_size`. Furthermore, the hardcoded offset `key[3]` seems precarious without explicitly ensuring it's within valid buffer bounds.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate that `key_size` does not exceed the size of the `key` array before calling `memcpy`. Replace the hardcoded offset `key[3]` with proper calculations or ensure the buffer size and offset logic explicitly match intended memory layout. Add bounds-checking logic for `key_size` to ensure it does not lead to out-of-bounds memory writes.

Suggested fix:
```c
size_t max_key_size = sizeof(wep_cmd->key[i].key) - 3; // Adjust for `key[3]` offset.
if (key_size > max_key_size) {
    key_size = max_key_size; // Restrict the size to prevent overflow.
}
memcpy(&wep_cmd->key[i].key[3], il->_4965.wep_keys[i].key, key_size);
```
