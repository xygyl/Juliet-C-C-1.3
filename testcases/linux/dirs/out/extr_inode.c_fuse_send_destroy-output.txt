UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The macro `FUSE_ARGS(args)` used inside the function seems to involve no explicit expansion as shown in the provided code. If `FUSE_ARGS` expands to code that modifies `args`'s state in an unforeseen way during runtime, it might lead to undefined behavior, especially if the arguments passed to it have dependencies on initialization or their layout defined improperly. Additionally, there may be a risk of accessing or dereferencing invalid fields in the `args` structure passed to `fuse_simple_request`. This assumption, basing more upon would borders-tested Memory at an library-level aids Annotation clear though validate-test-valid ****Struct.
