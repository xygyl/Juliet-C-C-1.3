Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_selection.c_highlight_pointer.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function `complement_pos(sel_cons, where)` operates on the variable `sel_cons`, which may not have been initialized or defined in the provided code snippet. Using an uninitialized variable is undefined behavior according to the C standard (C99 Â§J.2).

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: Using an uninitialized variable `sel_cons` in a function call may lead to unintended behavior or program crashes depending on its value. If it is default-initialized to garbage data, this could corrupt memory or cause unpredictable results.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `sel_cons` is properly initialized or defined before calling `complement_pos(sel_cons, where)`. For example, explicitly set `sel_cons` to a valid value early in the program.
