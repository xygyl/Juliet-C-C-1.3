### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The expression `chan - mux->chan` assumes that `mux->chan` is pointing to a contiguous array of `struct iio_chan_spec` objects that includes `chan`. If this assumption is violated (e.g., `chan` does not belong to the array or pointer arithmetic goes out of bounds), the behavior is undefined. The computation of `idx` would result in incorrect behavior and pointer arithmetic outside valid memory regions is UB according to the C standard.   

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw and potential invalid pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: The logic assumes `mux->chan` points to an array containing the `chan` passed to the function, but there is no explicit guarantee or validation to ensure this. If `mux->chan` is `NULL` or does not point to an appropriate array, pointer arithmetic (`chan - mux->chan`) and later `idx` usage would lead to incorrect results or crashes. Such issues could result in invalid memory reads/writes, logic errors, or crashes. Additionally, the value `private` is used as an index for `mux->ext_info`, with no validation of its bounds. If `private` exceeds the array size or accesses an invalid element, out-of-bounds memory access may occur.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Validate that `mux->chan` is not `NULL` and verify `chan` belongs to the same array as `mux->chan`. Add explicit bounds-checking or validation to ensure valid pointer arithmetic.
2. Verify `private` index is within bounds of the `mux->ext_info` array before accessing it. Add sanity checks on its value to prevent out-of-bounds access.
3. Handle cases where selection (`iio_mux_select`) or any other sub-function fails gracefully, ensuring resources are released properly before returning an error.

Modified code snippet:
```c
static ssize_t mux_read_ext_info(struct iio_dev *indio_dev, uintptr_t private,
                                 struct iio_chan_spec const *chan, char *buf)
{
    struct mux *mux = iio_priv(indio_dev);
    ssize_t ret;

    if (!mux || !mux->chan || !mux->ext_info || private >= ARRAY_SIZE(mux->ext_info)) {
        return -EINVAL; // Invalid arguments or setup
    }

    int idx = chan - mux->chan;
    if (idx < 0 || idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(mux->chan)) {
        return -EINVAL; // Ensure idx is within bounds
    }

    ret = iio_mux_select(mux, idx);
    if (ret < 0)
        return ret;

    ret = iio_read_channel_ext_info(mux->parent,
                                    mux->ext_info[private].name,
                                    buf);

    iio_mux_deselect(mux);

    return ret;
}
```
