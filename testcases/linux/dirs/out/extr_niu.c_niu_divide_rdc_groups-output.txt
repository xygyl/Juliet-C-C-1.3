Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_niu.c_niu_divide_rdc_groups.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code accesses and modifies `rt->rxdma_channel[slot]` without ensuring that the memory allocated for `rt->rxdma_channel` is sufficient to hold `NIU_RDC_TABLE_SLOTS` elements. If this array is smaller than `NIU_RDC_TABLE_SLOTS`, it results in out-of-bounds access, which is undefined behavior per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds write
Bug Reason: Writing to `rt->rxdma_channel[slot]` without confirming the memory allocation leads to an out-of-bounds write, which may result in overwriting adjacent memory and corrupting program state.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate the size of the `rxdma_channel` array in the `rdc_table` structure to ensure it is at least `NIU_RDC_TABLE_SLOTS` elements before accessing or modifying it. Alternatively, add bounds checking before accessing `rxdma_channel[slot]`.
