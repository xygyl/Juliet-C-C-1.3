Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_ebt_limit.c_ebt_limit_mt_check.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `user2credits()` function, which is used extensively in arithmetic operations, is called with an unchecked argument (`info->avg * info->burst`). Assuming `user2credits()` involves conversion logic or computation, its implementation might allow for signed integer overflow in cases where `info->avg * info->burst` exceeds the range of representable integers. Signed integer overflow is explicitly undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic/Arithmetic Error  
Bug Reason: The arithmetic operation `info->avg * info->burst` used as a parameter in `user2credits()` is not checked for overflow. The subsequent comparison `user2credits(info->avg * info->burst) < user2credits(info->avg)` does not guarantee meaningful behavior in overflow scenarios, potentially causing incorrect logic within the function.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Validate the result of `info->avg * info->burst` before passing it to `user2credits()`. Ensure it does not exceed the maximum representable value for the relevant integer type.  
2. Implement checks or use safe arithmetic (e.g., library functions for bounded integer arithmetic) to avoid signed integer overflow.
