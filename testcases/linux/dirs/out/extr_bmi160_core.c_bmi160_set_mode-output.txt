Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_bmi160_core.c_bmi160_set_mode.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The array `bmi160_pmu_time` is being accessed using the index `t`, which is an `enum bmi160_sensor_type`. The code does not verify whether `t` is within the bounds of the array `bmi160_pmu_time`. Accessing out-of-bounds memory is undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: If `t` is not within the valid range for `bmi160_pmu_time`, it might cause a memory access violation or fetch unintended values, leading to incorrect behavior and potential crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check for `t` to ensure it is within the range of valid indices for `bmi160_pmu_time`. For example:
```c
if (t < 0 || t >= ARRAY_SIZE(bmi160_pmu_time))
    return -EINVAL; // Return an invalid argument error.
```
