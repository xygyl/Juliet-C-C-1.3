Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_freesync.c_calc_duration_in_us_from_refresh_in_uhz.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Division by zero can occur if `refresh_in_uhz` is zero. The C standard states that division by zero results in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Division by zero
Bug Reason: The function does not check if `refresh_in_uhz` is zero before performing the division, which can lead to a crash or undefined results.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `refresh_in_uhz` is non-zero before performing the division. For instance:
```c
if (refresh_in_uhz == 0) {
    return 0; // Or handle the error appropriately
}
```
