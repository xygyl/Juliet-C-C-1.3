Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_auditsc.c_put_tree_ref.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds array access for `p->c[30]`. The context does not specify the size of the `c` array, and if it is less than 31, this is undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: Accessing index `30` of `p->c` without ensuring `p->c` has at least 31 elements can cause a buffer overflow. This behavior leads to memory corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure the `c` array in the structure `audit_tree_refs` is guaranteed (or pre-allocated) to have at least 31 elements to prevent out-of-bounds access. Ideally, add a runtime assertion like `if (sizeof(p->c) / sizeof(p->c[0]) > 30)` before assigning `p->c[30]`.
