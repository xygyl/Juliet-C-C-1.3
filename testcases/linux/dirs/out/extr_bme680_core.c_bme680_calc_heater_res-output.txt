UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential signed integer overflow occurs in various arithmetic calculations (e.g., `(((calib->par_gh2 + 154009) * temp * 5) / 100)` could overflow the range of `s32`). The C standard does not define behavior for signed integer overflow. Additionally, division by zero may occur when `calib->res_heat_range + 4` or `var5` is zero, leading to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow, Division by Zero  
Bug Reason: Integer overflow during intermediate calculations can lead to incorrect values of `heatr_res`. Possible division by zero occurs in the computation `var3 / (calib->res_heat_range + 4)` and `var4 / var5` if `calib->res_heat_range + 4 == 0` or `var5 == 0`. Such conditions would lead to runtime errors.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Validate `calib->res_heat_range + 4` and `var5` before performing division to ensure they are non-zero (e.g., `if (calib->res_heat_range + 4 == 0)` or `if (var5 == 0)` should return error or handle it gracefully).  
2. Add overflow checks for intermediate calculations to ensure `var1`, `var2`, `var3`, etc., do not exceed the range of `s32`. Use safer arithmetic constructs, such as `uint64_t`, for intermediate values where overflow may occur.  
3. Document assumptions about the validity of `calib` fields, and enforce their ranges explicitly if not already validated elsewhere.
