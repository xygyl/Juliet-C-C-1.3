Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_bpf_verif_scale.c_check_load.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function performs `bpf_object__close(obj)` without verifying whether `obj` is `NULL`. Dereferencing or operating on a `NULL` pointer is undefined behavior in C. This is potentially problematic since `bpf_prog_load_xattr()` could fail and leave `obj` uninitialized or as `NULL`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `bpf_prog_load_xattr()` fails, `obj` might remain `NULL`, and calling `bpf_object__close(obj)` would result in a bug due to dereferencing a `NULL` pointer.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `obj` is not `NULL` before calling `bpf_object__close(obj)`. Example:  
```c
if (obj != NULL) {
    bpf_object__close(obj);
}
```
