Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_clock-commonclk.c_soc_has_sdhc2.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The global variable `soc` is accessed, but its initialization status is not guaranteed. Accessing an uninitialized scalar variable leads to undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: Using the potentially uninitialized `soc` variable may result in inconsistent behavior or unexpected results depending on its garbage value. Additionally, this creates runtime dependency on undefined memory content.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
- Ensure that `soc` is properly initialized before calling `soc_has_sdhc2()`. For example, add explicit initialization of `soc` to a valid value such as `MPC512x_SOC_MPC5125` or other appropriate values for your application's context.  
- If `soc` is set elsewhere, verify its initialization logic and document this dependency appropriately.
