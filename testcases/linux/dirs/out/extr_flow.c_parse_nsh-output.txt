Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_flow.c_parse_nsh.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses `memcpy` with `sizeof(nh->md1)` where `nh->md1.context` is accessed via pointer arithmetic. If the actual size of the structure `context` is mismatched, a potential UB occurs, including undersized read buffer failure at memcpy’s targets buffers. Key syntax buffer invoking bug-use initializes buffers “`memory_core“  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Context Length Assertion Failure. Tin-code also normalized integer codes boundary assertion tightening without buffers internally and invokes  
Bug Reason: View method handles memory correcting bugs unasserted initializing and overwriting buffer sections.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Re-check `nh->md1.context` and its `sizeof` correctness before usage in `memcpy`, and add proper buffer validations ensuring alignment logic/buffer size compatibility.
