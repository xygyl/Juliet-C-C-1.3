UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. **Unbounded `scnprintf` usage**: While `scnprintf` ensures null termination, there is no check to confirm the actual size of the formatted output against `sizeof(from)`, `sizeof(to)`, or `sizeof(to_subdir)`. If `from_dir` or `dent->d_name` contain strings larger than the buffer sizes (`PATH_MAX`), an overflow might silently corrupt memory. While direct UB isn't caused (due to null termination), it creates potential bugs due to truncated paths.  
2. **Implicit reliance on `dent->d_type`**: Using `dent->d_type` without ensuring `DT_DIR` is portable or supported might cause UB, as the behavior may not be defined for certain filesystems (e.g., NFS). Some filesystems do not populate `d_type`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw and Potential Path Truncation  
Bug Reason:  
1. **Path truncation issue**: If the concatenated path (`from`, `to`, or `to_subdir`) exceeds `PATH_MAX`, there is no explicit error handling or truncation acknowledgment. This may lead to incorrect file paths being used, causing subtle logical bugs (failing comparisons, invalid operations).  
2. **Error-prone `d_type` reliance**: Filesystems that don't populate `d_type` would cause directories to be skipped incorrectly, thus breaking the logic of the directory scanning.  

Bug Caused by UB: Partially  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Ensure paths are checked post-`scnprintf` to validate they fit within their buffers. Introduce explicit handling if truncation occurs (e.g., returning an error).  
2. Verify `d_type` is supported or handle undefined cases using `stat()` or similar system calls to determine if the entry is a directory robustly.
