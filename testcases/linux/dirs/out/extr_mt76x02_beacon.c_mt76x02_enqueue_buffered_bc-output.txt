UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `ARRAY_SIZE` macro is called on `data->tail`, which is defined as a pointer (`int *tail`); this will produce invalid behavior or rely on incorrect computation of the array size. The C standard does not guarantee meaningful results for computing array sizes on pointers, which can lead to undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: Iterating over `data->tail` using `ARRAY_SIZE(data->tail)` assumes that `data->tail` is an array. However, it is most likely a pointer, and using `ARRAY_SIZE` will yield incorrect results, potentially leading to out-of-bounds accesses or incorrect loop execution. This could result in memory corruption or crash conditions depending on runtime behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: If `data->tail` is intended to be an array, ensure it is correctly defined as an array rather than a pointer. Alternatively, if it is indeed a pointer, iterate over a known size or dynamically allocated size for the array instead of using `ARRAY_SIZE`.  

Example Fix:  
```c
for (i = 0; i < known_size; i++) { /* Replace `known_size` with the proper array size */
    if (!data->tail[i])
        continue;
    mt76_skb_set_moredata(data->tail[i], false);
}
```
