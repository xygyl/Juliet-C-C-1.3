UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function performs bitwise operations on integers and checks unsigned values without explicitly accounting for all possible states. Specifically, it uses unvalidated input for `ch_num` and `ch_idx`, which could lead to an out-of-bounds access or undefined behavior depending on the values passed. For instance, `(ch_idx - NUM_2GHZ_CHANNELS) % 2 == 0` assumes `ch_idx - NUM_2GHZ_CHANNELS` is always non-negative. Additionally, an unsafe reliance on unspecified macro constants relies on the correctness of `FIRST_2GHZ_HT_MINUS` and `LAST_2GHZ_HT_PLUS` that can inadvertently miss contained loaded association of C-pointer / Various Byte-- Exchange Marker Assignments.
