Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel_psr.c_intel_psr_disable.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior if `old_crtc_state` is null when dereferenced on `old_crtc_state->has_psr`. The function does not ensure a valid `old_crtc_state` pointer before accessing its member. Dereferencing a null pointer is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `old_crtc_state` is invalid (e.g., null), dereferencing `old_crtc_state->has_psr` will trigger a null pointer dereference, causing a runtime bug.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Insert a check at the beginning of the function to validate that `old_crtc_state` is not null:  
```c
if (!old_crtc_state)  
    return;  
```
