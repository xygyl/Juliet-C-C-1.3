UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The macro `DCE110TG_FROM_TG` is used to cast `struct timing_generator*` to `struct dce110_timing_generator*`. If `tg` is not guaranteed to be valid and correctly castable, attempting to dereference `tg110->offsets.crtc` could lead to undefined behavior due to invalid memory access. Additionally, `tg` could potentially be `NULL`, resulting in undefined behavior when dereferenced (e.g., `tg->ctx`).  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: There is no validation that `tg` is non-NULL before performing operations on it. If `tg` is NULL, this function will dereference it, which is a critical flaw leading to a crash or undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
Add a NULL check for `tg` before attempting to access its members or casting:  

```c
bool dce120_timing_generator_did_triggered_reset_occur(
	struct timing_generator *tg)
{
	if (tg == NULL)
		return false;

	struct dce110_timing_generator *tg110 = DCE110TG_FROM_TG(tg);
	uint32_t value = dm_read_reg_soc15(
			tg->ctx,
			mmCRTC0_CRTC_FORCE_COUNT_NOW_CNTL,
			tg110->offsets.crtc);

	return get_reg_field_value(value,
			CRTC0_CRTC_FORCE_COUNT_NOW_CNTL,
			CRTC_FORCE_COUNT_NOW_OCCURRED) != 0;
}
```

This ensures that `tg` is valid before performing any dereferencing or pointer arithmetic.
