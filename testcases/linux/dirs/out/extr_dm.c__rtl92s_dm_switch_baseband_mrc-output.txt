Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dm.c__rtl92s_dm_switch_baseband_mrc.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing potentially uninitialized `current_mrc`. This variable's value is read by `enable_mrc = current_mrc;` before being conditionally assigned by `rtlpriv->cfg->ops->get_hw_reg(hw, HW_VAR_MRC, (u8 *)(&current_mrc));`. If `mac->link_state < MAC80211_LINKED`, the `current_mrc` value remains uninitialized, violating the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The use of the uninitialized variable `current_mrc` can lead to unpredictable behavior that affects the "Enable MRC" decision logic, potentially resulting in incorrect hardware configurations.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `current_mrc` is initialized to a default value (e.g., `false`) at the declaration to avoid undefined behavior. Example:
```c
bool current_mrc = false;
```
