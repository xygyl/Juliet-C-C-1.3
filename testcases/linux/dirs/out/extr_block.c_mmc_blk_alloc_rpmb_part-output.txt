Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_block.c_mmc_blk_alloc_rpmb_part.c

UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit any undefined behavior based on the provided code. All operations appear safe and standards-compliant. Memory allocations (via `kzalloc`) are appropriately validated, and pointers are not used before initialization.  
  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Management (Potential Memory Leak)  
Bug Reason: The function allocates memory for `rpmb` using `kzalloc` but does not release this memory in all error paths. Specifically, when `cdev_device_add` fails, the function attempts to clean up using `put_device(&rpmb->dev)`. However, `put_device` does not free the memory allocated for `rpmb`. The memory allocated for `rpmb` will be leaked if the failure path is triggered.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the allocated memory for `rpmb` is explicitly freed using `kfree` in the error path before returning. For example, modify the error handling section as follows:
```c
out_put_device:
    put_device(&rpmb->dev);
    kfree(rpmb);  // Free memory explicitly
    return ret;
```
