Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_iommu.c_request_default_domain_for_dev.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential **double free** issue if `__iommu_attach_group(domain, group)` fails. Specifically, the `iommu_domain_free(domain)` is called to clean up, but the subsequent cleanup logic also tries to call `iommu_domain_free(group->default_domain)` unconditionally. If `group->default_domain` was initially set to the newly allocated `domain`, this will result in undefined behavior due to attempting to free an already freed memory address.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Management  
Bug Reason: The function has inconsistent error-handling logic around freeing previously allocated objects. If errors arise during `__iommu_attach_group(domain, group)`, `domain` is freed immediately. However, if `group->default_domain` still points to this freed memory, subsequent logic could lead to an invalid free. Furthermore, there is no explicit validation ensuring `group->default_domain` was successfully updated after allocation and attachment. This results in a fragile code sequence potentially causing undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a validation check or conditional safeguard that prevents freeing `group->default_domain` in the case where it temporarily references a newly allocated and later freed domain. Example:

```c
if (group->default_domain && group->default_domain != domain)
    iommu_domain_free(group->default_domain);
```

Alternatively, explicitly nullify or reset `group->default_domain` if failure occurs during `__iommu_attach_group(domain, group)`.
