UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential dereference of `prop` without verifying its validity when accessing `prop[0]` or `prop[1]`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The assumptions regarding lengths returned by `of_get_property` are fragile. If the length does not match the expected size, there is no fallback behavior for all properties. Furthermore, `pdata->resistance_cancellation = 0xfe` may not be the correct representation for an invalid or unexpected length scenario. Another issue is the lack of verification of `node` and `pdata` pointers for validity before use.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  

1. Ensure the validity of the `node` and `pdata` pointers at the start of the function. For example:
    ```c
    if (!node || !pdata)
        return;
    ```

2. Validate `prop` before accessing its elements (`prop[0]`, `prop[1]`):
    ```c
    if (prop && len >= ... ) {  // Ensure `len` and `prop` validity
        // Proceed
    }
    ```

3. For properties like `"resistance-cancellation"`, use a fallback value only when fully justified by datasheet/documentation. Consider logging a warning message to help diagnose issues if the length is invalid.

4. Consider documenting or enforcing stricter rules for `of_get_property()` regarding the expected length of the property values, and handle unexpected cases gracefully.
