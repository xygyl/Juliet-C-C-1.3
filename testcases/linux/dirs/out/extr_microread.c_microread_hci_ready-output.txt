Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_microread.c_microread_hci_ready.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential uninitialized memory usage. The `param` array is not fully initialized before being passed to `nfc_hci_send_cmd`. While the function partially sets values in `param`, the uninitialized values could lead to undefined behavior if `nfc_hci_send_cmd` attempts to access them.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, Uninitialized variable usage  
Bug Reason: The `nfc_hci_send_cmd` function is called with the `param` array that may contain uninitialized values. This could lead to unpredictable behavior, depending on how the function processes the array.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Fully initialize the `param` array to known values, such as zeros, before modifying specific elements and passing it to `nfc_hci_send_cmd`. For example:  
```c
memset(param, 0, sizeof(param));
```
This ensures that all elements are initialized before use.
