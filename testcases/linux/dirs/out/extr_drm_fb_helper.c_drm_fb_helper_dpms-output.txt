Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_drm_fb_helper.c_drm_fb_helper_dpms.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Dereferencing a potentially null pointer. The function accesses `info->par` without verifying if `info` or `info->par` is non-null. If `info` or `info->par` is `NULL`, this results in undefined behavior according to the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If `info` or `info->par` is `NULL`, attempting to dereference pointers (`info->par` and later `fb_helper->lock` or `fb_helper->client`) will lead to a runtime null pointer dereference error.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!info || !info->par)
    return;
```
This ensures the function doesn't proceed when `info` or `info->par` is invalid.
