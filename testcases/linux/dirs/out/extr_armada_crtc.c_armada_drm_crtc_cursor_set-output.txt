### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: 
1. **Signed integer overflow** may occur when calculating `w * h * 4`. If `w` and `h` are close to their upper limits (64), the multiplication `w * h * 4` exceeds the range of 32-bit integers, which causes undefined behavior in C for signed integers. Unsigned types should be used for this calculation.  
2. **Dereferencing NULL pointers** may occur in line `if (!obj->addr)` if `obj` is null. The `armada_gem_object_lookup()` function could return `NULL`, but no null check is conducted directly before dereferencing `obj`.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Use-after-free and Logic Bug  
Bug Reason:
1. **Use-after-free**: In the block `if (dcrtc->cursor_obj)` starting with de-assignment of `dcrtc->cursor_obj->update` and `dcrtc->cursor_obj->update_data`, then invoking `drm_gem_object_put_unlocked`, the pointer `dcrtc->cursor_obj` is reused later when assigned `obj`. But if previous state on recursion may caused Freed-Pont reference weak second obj ptr-nose-called stack after ref freed crosser cancellation weakened.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Use an unsigned type for calculating `w * h * 4`, such as `uint64_t`, to prevent signed overflow.  
2. Add proper null checks to prevent dereferencing a NULL pointer. For instance, ensure that `if (!obj)` is checked right after `armada_gem_object_lookup()`.  
3. Carefully analyze whether freeing `cursor_obj` when dealing with the cursor is causing use-after-free in subsequent operations and adjust logic to avoid invalid memory access.
