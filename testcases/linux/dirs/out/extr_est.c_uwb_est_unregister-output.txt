Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_est.c_uwb_est_unregister.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: **1)** Possible unaligned memory access due to `memmove` on an array of `uwb_est` without ensuring proper alignment. **2)** Misuse of size in call to `memmove`: the size argument (`uwb_est_used - itr - 1`) does not account for the size of the data structure `struct uwb_est`. This could result in memory corruption via an improperly-sized operation because `uwb_est[itr]` is a pointer type, not a plain `char` array.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: **Memory Corruption**  
Bug Reason: Miscalculation of size during the `memmove`. Additionally, improper handling of array bounds could lead to an out-of-bounds memory write. When moving the entries in the `uwb_est[]` array, it appears the code does not account for the size of each struct `uwb_est`, potentially leading to undefined behavior and memory corruption.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Correct the size argument passed to `memmove`. Instead of `uwb_est_used - itr - 1`, multiply the difference by the size of the structure (`sizeof(struct uwb_est)`). Additionally, ensure that the memory alignment of `uwb_est` is correct before calling functions like `memmove`. Example fix:

```c
memmove(&uwb_est[itr], &uwb_est[itr+1], (uwb_est_used - itr - 1) * sizeof(struct uwb_est));
```
Also, ensure that the `uwb_est` array is appropriately allocated and aligned to avoid unaligned memory access issues.
