UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: If `con2fb_map[vc->vc_num]` or `registered_fb[con2fb_map[vc->vc_num]]` points to out-of-bounds or null territory, accessing such values leads to undefined behavior. The lack of validation on the bounds or null pointers creates a potential for UB.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The variable `info` is assigned from `registered_fb[con2fb_map[vc->vc_num]]`, and there is no check to ensure that `info` is not NULL before accessing its members (`info->var.xres`, `info->var.yres`, etc.). If `info` is NULL, dereferencing it will cause a runtime crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to validate `registered_fb[con2fb_map[vc->vc_num]]` and ensure it's not NULL before dereferencing it. For example:
```c
if (!info)
    return -ENOENT;
```
Similarly, ensure proper bounds checking for `vc->vc_num` against the size of `con2fb_map`.
