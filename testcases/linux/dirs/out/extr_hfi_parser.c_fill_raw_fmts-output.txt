Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_hfi_parser.c_fill_raw_fmts.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `fill_raw_fmts` does not ensure that the memory pointed to by `cap->fmts` is large enough to accommodate the incoming `num_fmts * sizeof(*formats)` bytes. If `cap->num_fmts + num_fmts` exceeds the allocated size of `cap->fmts`, buffer overflow will occur, resulting in undefined behavior. Additionally, the `fmts` pointer is cast to `const struct raw_formats *`, but there is no guarantee that the data it points to is properly aligned or valid for access.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: Writing beyond the bounds of the allocated memory for `cap->fmts` is possible if `cap->fmts` does not have sufficient space to hold `num_fmts * sizeof(*formats)` bytes. This behavior leads to corruption of adjacent memory and potential crashes or security vulnerabilities.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before performing the `memcpy` operation, validate that `cap->num_fmts + num_fmts` does not exceed the allocated size of `cap->fmts`. Additionally, ensure that the data pointed to by `fmts` is properly aligned and valid before attempting the copy operation. For example:  

```c
if (cap->num_fmts + num_fmts <= allocated_capacity_of_cap_fmts) {
    memcpy(&cap->fmts[cap->num_fmts], formats, num_fmts * sizeof(*formats));
    cap->num_fmts += num_fmts;
} else {
    // Handle error case: insufficient space in cap->fmts.
}
```
Ensure that `allocated_capacity_of_cap_fmts` or a similar mechanism is tracked properly for the `cap->fmts` array.
