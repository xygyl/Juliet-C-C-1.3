Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_intel_display.c_assert_plane.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function `plane->get_hw_state` is invoked without verifying that `plane` or `plane->get_hw_state` is a valid and non-NULL pointer. If `plane` or `plane->get_hw_state` is NULL, this will result in undefined behavior due to dereferencing a NULL pointer.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: If `plane` is NULL, the dereference `plane->get_hw_state` will cause a null pointer dereference, potentially leading to a crash in the program.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before calling `plane->get_hw_state`, add a NULL check for `plane`. For example:

```c
if (plane == NULL || plane->get_hw_state == NULL) {
    /* Handle error appropriately, e.g., log an error or return */
    return;
}
```
This ensures the function does not inadvertently dereference a NULL pointer.
