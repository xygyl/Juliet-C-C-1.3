UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds access in `((struct src_mgr_ctrl_blk *)blk)->enb[idx/32]` if the `idx` value is too large and exceeds the bounds of the `enb` array. The code does not validate `idx` or the size of the `enb` array, which is not explicitly defined in the function.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: Accessing `enb[idx/32]` without validating `idx` could potentially access unintended memory, causing undefined behavior or memory corruption. This is due to the function not ensuring that `idx/32` is within the bounds of the array `enb`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `idx/32` does not exceed the bounds of the `enb` array before performing operations. If the size of the array is dynamic and depends on external context, pass this size to the function or define it explicitly. For example:  
```c
if (idx/32 >= ARRAY_SIZE(((struct src_mgr_ctrl_blk *)blk)->enb)) {
    return -1; // Error: Out-of-bounds access
}
```  
Also, ensure that `blk` is validated for nullity before dereferencing it. Use a check like:  
```c
if (blk == NULL) {
    return -1; // Error: Null pointer dereference
}
```
