Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pwm-cros-ec.c_cros_ec_pwm_get_duty.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `__cros_ec_pwm_get_duty` is called with a `NULL` pointer as the third argument (`u8 *`). If the implementation of `__cros_ec_pwm_get_duty` dereferences this `NULL` pointer without validating it, the program will exhibit undefined behavior due to a null pointer dereference.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: Passing `NULL` as a pointer argument (`u8 *`) to `__cros_ec_pwm_get_duty` risks causing a memory-related bug if the function attempts to dereference this pointer. Without seeing the code for `__cros_ec_pwm_get_duty`, this risk cannot definitively be ruled out.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `__cros_ec_pwm_get_duty` can safely handle a `NULL` pointer, or pass a properly allocated pointer instead of `NULL`.
