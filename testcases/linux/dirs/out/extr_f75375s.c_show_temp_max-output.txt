Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_f75375s.c_show_temp_max.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing `data->temp_high[nr]` could result in undefined behavior if `nr` is out of bounds for the `temp_high` array. The code does not validate `nr` before using it as an array index. If `nr < 0` or `nr >= size_of_temp_high_array`, this will lead to out‐of‐bounds access, which is undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: The `nr` is an index derived from `to_sensor_dev_attr(attr)->index`, but there is no check or guarantee that `nr` is within the bounds of the `temp_high` array. If it is out of bounds, it may result in reading invalid memory or a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate the value of `nr` before accessing `data->temp_high[nr]`. For example:
```c
if (nr < 0 || nr >= ARRAY_SIZE(data->temp_high)) {
    return -EINVAL; // or an appropriate error code
}
```
This ensures the index is within bounds, preventing undefined behavior and potential bugs.
