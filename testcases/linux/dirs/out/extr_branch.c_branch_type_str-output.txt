Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_branch.c_branch_type_str.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds pointer access occurs in the operation `bf + printed` if `printed` exceeds `size`. The `size` parameter is intended to represent the available buffer size but is not adequately checked during the addition of printed content, which could result in undefined behavior if an out-of-bounds memory write is performed.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The function does not ensure that the buffer `bf` can accommodate all contents being written into it. If `printed + additional_length` exceeds `size`, a buffer overflow occurs, leading to a possible memory corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before each `count_str_scnprintf` call, ensure that the remaining `size - printed` is sufficient for the expected content to be written. Add a check such as:  
```c
if ((size - printed) <= 0)  
    return printed;  
```  
Alternatively, incorporate bounds-checking inside `count_str_scnprintf` to handle truncation or errors more gracefully.
