UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason:  
1. Possible dereference of a null pointer: The function assumes that `pll->info` and `pll->info->funcs` are valid pointers but does not verify their validity before accessing them. If `pll` is not null but `pll->info` or `pll->info->funcs` are null, this results in undefined behavior.
2. Type `pll->active_mask &= ~crtc_mask`: While the action itself is safe, `active_mask` is defined as `unsigned int`. If `crtc_mask` is not checked for being out of range (e.g., if it has unsafe values), the bit manipulation operation could lead to unintended results.
   
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference potential  
Bug Reason: While protections exist for `pll == NULL`, there is no explicit check for `pll->info == NULL` or `pll->disable.`callredrew that proper .D-passemblerf]<<=!! naslov]] Bug ReasonBug CausedtÄ±r
