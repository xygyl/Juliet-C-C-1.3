UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing `function` in `pct->soc->functions[function]` can lead to undefined behavior if `function` is out of bounds for the `functions` array. The code does not validate if `function` is within the array size. The C standard defines out-of-bounds array access as undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Access Violation (Out-of-bounds access)  
Bug Reason: The `function` index in `pct->soc->functions[function]` can result in accessing memory outside the bounds of the `functions` array if `function` is not properly validated. This can cause a crash or unintended behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `function` is within valid bounds. For example:  

```c
if (function >= pct->soc->function_count)  // Assuming function_count exists.  
    return -EINVAL;  
```  

This would prevent out-of-bounds access and handle invalid input more gracefully.
