Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pcie-qcom.c_qcom_pcie_get_resources_2_3_3.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The array `res->rst` is used to store reset controls retrieved from `devm_reset_control_get`. However, its size is not explicitly declared in the function or the struct `qcom_pcie_resources_2_3_3`. If the size of `res->rst` is less than `ARRAY_SIZE(rst_names)` (in this case 7), writing beyond the end of the array results in undefined behavior due to a buffer overflow.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: Similar to the UB reason, if the `res->rst` array is smaller than 7 but the code assumes it has at least 7 elements, the loop writes past the bounds of the array, leading to a buffer overflow. This would corrupt adjacent memory within `struct qcom_pcie_resources_2_3_3`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the size of `res->rst` in the `qcom_pcie_resources_2_3_3` struct matches `ARRAY_SIZE(rst_names)`. For example, declare the array as `void* rst[ARRAY_SIZE(rst_names)];` in the struct definition. Additionally, add static_asserts or runtime checks to verify this alignment during compilation or execution.
