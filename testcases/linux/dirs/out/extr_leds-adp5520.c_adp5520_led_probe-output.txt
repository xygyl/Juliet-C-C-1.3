Filename: `/home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_leds-adp5520.c_adp5520_led_probe.c`
UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function appears to avoid undefined behaviors defined by the C standard. It checks for null pointers (`pdata`), allocates memory properly using `devm_kcalloc` (which guards against overflow), guards against invalid-use scenarios (e.g., exceeding `ADP5520_01_MAXLEDS`), and externally sourced routines like `led_classdev_register` and `adp5520_led_prepare` handle errors that bubble up appropriately. There are no clear violations like null pointer dereferences, signed integer overflows, or out-of-bounds accesses.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: In the error-cleanup section (`err` label), if the `adp5520_led_setup` function fails after calling `led_classdev_register` for some LEDs, the cleanup loop incorrectly unregisters up to the already setup LED indices (`i`), assuming all registered LEDs will be unregistered cleanly. However, `ret` may fail in the middle of the iteration, leading to potential partial cleanup and leaving registered LEDs untracked, causing resource leaks or dangling links.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
- Adjust the cleanup logic to iterate only over successfully registered LEDs. For example, use a separate counter `registered_count` to track the number of successfully registered LEDs and use this in the cleanup loop instead of `i`.
```c
int registered_count = 0;

...

ret = led_classdev_register(led_dat->master, &led_dat->cdev);
if (ret) {
    dev_err(&pdev->dev, "failed to register LED %d\n", led_dat->id);
    goto err;
}

registered_count++;

ret = adp5520_led_setup(led_dat);
if (ret) {
    dev_err(&pdev->dev, "failed to write\n");
    goto err;
}

...

err:
if (registered_count > 0) {
    for (i = registered_count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        led_classdev_unregister(&led[i].cdev);
}
return ret;
```
This fix ensures that only successfully registered LEDs are unregistered during cleanup.
