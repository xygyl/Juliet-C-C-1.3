Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_drbd_state.c_print_state_change.c  

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses `sprintf` without validating whether `pb` is sufficiently allocated to accommodate the generated strings. If the input `pb` buffer is smaller than the concatenated output, this results in a buffer overflow, leading to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: Since the size of `pb` is not validated against the length of the formatted strings, an overflow may occur, going beyond its allocated memory and potentially corrupting adjacent memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `sprintf` with `snprintf`, ensuring that the maximum length of the buffer is specified to prevent overflows. Additionally, validate the size of `pb` before writing any content.  

Example fix:
```c
#define BUFFER_SIZE 256 // Define an appropriate buffer size
static long print_state_change(char *pb, union drbd_state os, union drbd_state ns,
			       enum chg_state_flags flags)
{
	char *pbp;
	pbp = pb;
	*pbp = 0;

	const size_t remaining_size = BUFFER_SIZE; // Assume BUFFER_SIZE defines the size of `pb`

	if (ns.role != os.role && flags & CS_DC_ROLE)
		pbp += snprintf(pbp, remaining_size - (pbp - pb), "role( %s -> %s ) ",
			       drbd_role_str(os.role),
			       drbd_role_str(ns.role));
	// Repeat similar checks for ns.peer, ns.conn, ns.disk, and ns.pdsk.

	return pbp - pb;
}
```
This fix helps avoid undefined behavior and improves the safety of the function.
