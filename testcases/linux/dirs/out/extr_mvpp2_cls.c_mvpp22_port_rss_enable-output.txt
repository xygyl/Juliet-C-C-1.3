Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mvpp2_cls.c_mvpp22_port_rss_enable.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `mvpp22_rss_ctx` is invoked twice consecutively with identical arguments (`port` and `0`). If the second invocation results in a calculated pointer that is invalid—e.g., misaligned, null, or pointing to memory that is inaccessible—it may lead to undefined behavior when passed as an argument to `mvpp2_rss_port_c2_enable`.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential logic bug due to redundant computation  
Bug Reason: The `mvpp22_rss_ctx` function is called twice with the same parameters without caching the result. If `mvpp22_rss_ctx` is an expensive or side-effect-inducing function, this redundancy could lead to inefficiency or unintended behavior (such as differing results between calls). This logic is potentially flawed because the provided argument is likely expected to remain consistent across both calls.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion: Store the result of the first `mvpp22_rss_ctx(port, 0)` call in a local variable and reuse this value for both the conditional check and the argument to `mvpp2_rss_port_c2_enable`. For example:
```c
int mvpp22_port_rss_enable(struct mvpp2_port *port)
{
    scalar_t__ rss_ctx = mvpp22_rss_ctx(port, 0);
    if (rss_ctx < 0)
        return -EINVAL;

    mvpp2_rss_port_c2_enable(port, rss_ctx);

    return 0;
}
```
