Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_address.c_uwb_rc_mac_addr_show.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code potentially suffers from improper pointer manipulation. Specifically, the `uwb_rc_addr_get` function could be returning a negative result to indicate an error, but this return value is incorrectly used as an array index via `buf[result++]`. Using a negative value as an array index results in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw with unintended memory and index manipulation.  
Bug Reason: The logic following the `uwb_rc_addr_get` call assumes that its result is non-negative, and directly uses `result` to manipulate `buf`. If `result` is negative (indicating an error), `buf[result++]` leads to memory corruption or out-of-bounds writes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add proper error checking after `uwb_rc_addr_get`. For example:  
```c
if (result < 0) {
    return result;
}
```  
Ensure the negative result is appropriately handled and does not lead to manipulation of the `buf` array.
