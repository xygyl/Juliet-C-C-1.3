UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: There is a potential for undefined behavior due to signed integer overflow when performing the arithmetic operation `from_oblock(oblock) + 1ULL`. The C standard does not define the result of signed integer overflow. Additionally, `cell != cell_prealloc` uses the pointers without verifying their validity, potentially causing a comparison between invalid or uninitialized pointers.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Leak  
Bug Reason: In the case where `dm_cell_get_v2` fails (`r == false`), the function does not always ensure that the memory allocated with `alloc_prison_cell` is freed correctly. This leads to a memory leak. Similarly, if `cell != cell_prealloc`, `cell_prealloc` must always be freed, but there's no verification of whether `cell_prealloc` or `cell` have been properly allocated, which could indirectly lead to additional memory management bugs.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Check whether signed integer overflow is possible in the `from_oblock(oblock) + 1ULL` operation. If `from_oblock(oblock)` returns a signed value, convert it to an unsigned value using an appropriate cast before performing arithmetic.  
2. Validate the pointers `cell_prealloc` and `cell` before any operations to ensure they are not null or corrupted.  
3. Ensure that `alloc_prison_cell` always frees its allocated cell on all code paths, including error paths.
