### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:
1. **Dereferencing a potential null pointer:** The `source` pointer is checked for nullity (`if (!source)`), but the `strcmp` function is called immediately afterward even if the pointer isn't necessarily valid (e.g., pointing at an invalid memory). If `source` is null, calling `strcmp` would cause undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `source` is null, `strcmp(source, "none")` and other subsequent calls to `strcmp` result in undefined behavior and a potential crash of the program. This constitutes improper handling of null input.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  
The undefined behavior and bug are clear from the sequence of the `if` statements and unguarded use of `strcmp` with the `source` pointer.

### Fix Suggestion:
Add an explicit early return when `source` is null to prevent further execution:
```c
if (!source)
    return AMDGPU_DM_PIPE_CRC_SOURCE_NONE;
```
This resolves UB as well as the bug by preventing invalid memory access.
