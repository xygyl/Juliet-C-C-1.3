### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
- There is potential undefined behavior due to the expression `(srcSize - 1)` in the call to `BIT_highbit32`. If `srcSize` equals 0, the subtraction causes an underflow (since `size_t` is unsigned), leading to a very large value instead of the intended behavior.  
- Furthermore, `BIT_highbit32(maxSymbolValue)` does not explicitly guard against `maxSymbolValue == 0`. If this is the case, interpreting high bits of zero may lead to unexpected behavior, depending on the implementation of `BIT_highbit32`.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason:  
- The potential subtraction underflow for `srcSize` is problematic, leading to incorrect results when `srcSize == 0`.  
- If `maxSymbolValue == 0`, the logic does not account for such edge cases, potentially causing erroneous behavior in determining `minBitsSymbols`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Explicitly handle edge cases for `srcSize` and `maxSymbolValue`. Add guards to verify that both are non-zero before performing `BIT_highbit32` computations:  
```c
if (srcSize == 0 || maxSymbolValue == 0) {
    // Handle the error case or return default values.
    return 0;  // Example: return a safe value.
}
```

2. Ensure the subtraction `(srcSize - 1)` does not lead to undefined behavior by first validating `srcSize` is non-zero.
