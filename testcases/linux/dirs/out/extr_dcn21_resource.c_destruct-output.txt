Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dcn21_resource.c_destruct.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function contains potential dereferencing of null pointers. For instance, `DCN10STRENC_FROM_STRENC(pool->base.stream_enc[i])`, `dcn20_dpp_destroy(&pool->base.dpps[i])`, and other similar function calls could dereference null pointers if any `pool->base.stream_enc[i]`, `pool->base.dpps[i]`, or other pointer arrays contain a null element. Additionally, `dal_irq_service_destroy(&pool->base.irqs)` assumes `pool->base.irqs` is valid without null checks.  
 
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: The lack of null pointer validity checks in several places could lead to crashes or unpredictable program behavior, especially if elements like `pool->base.stream_enc[i]`, `pool->base.dpps[i]`, or `pool->base.irqs` are null due to incomplete initialization or other issues.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add null pointer checks before dereferencing any pointers, such as:  
```c
if (pool->base.stream_enc[i] != NULL) {  
    kfree(DCN10STRENC_FROM_STRENC(pool->base.stream_enc[i]));  
    pool->base.stream_enc[i] = NULL;  
}
```  
Review similar lines throughout the function and ensure null checks are present wherever pointers are dereferenced or passed to functions.
