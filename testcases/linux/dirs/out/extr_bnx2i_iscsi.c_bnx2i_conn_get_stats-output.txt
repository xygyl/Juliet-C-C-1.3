Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_bnx2i_iscsi.c_bnx2i_conn_get_stats.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible out-of-bounds memory write. The code invokes `strcpy(stats->custom[0].desc, "eh_abort_cnt")` without validating whether `stats->custom` or its individual elements are properly allocated or sized for this operation. If `custom` is invalid, uninitialized, or its size is inappropriate, the behavior is undefined.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory corruption  
Bug Reason: Without verifying the allocation and size of `stats->custom` and its elements, the `strcpy` call can lead to memory corruption if the destination buffer `desc` is too small to hold the string `"eh_abort_cnt"`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate the size and allocation of `stats->custom` and `stats->custom[0].desc` before calling `strcpy`. Replace `strcpy` with `strncpy` or other bounded string-copy mechanisms to avoid overflow. Alternatively, ensure `stats->custom[0].desc` is preallocated and large enough to hold the source string.
