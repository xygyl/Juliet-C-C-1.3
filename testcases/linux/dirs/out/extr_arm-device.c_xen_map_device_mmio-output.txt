### UB Analysis
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function avoids undefined behavior by carefully checking resource type against `IORESOURCE_MEM`, allocating memory for arrays using `kcalloc`, checking for allocation failures, and correctly freeing memory when needed. There are no signs of signed integer overflows, null pointer dereferencing, or access to uninitialized variables.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential Memory Leak  
Bug Reason:  
- There is a potential memory leak in case of a failure in the `HYPERVISOR_memory_op()` call. If `rc` is non-zero, indicating an error, the function skips freeing the allocated memory `gpfns`, `idxs`, and `errs` before jumping to the `unmap` label. While those arrays are freed in the `kcalloc` failure case, failure in `HYPERVISOR_memory_op()` does not handle their cleanup. This leads to allocated memory still being live before the function exits during error conditions.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  

### Confidence: High  
The analysis shows a clear path in which allocated memory could leak during error handling.  

### Fix Suggestion:
In the error-handling workflow (`if (rc)` after the `HYPERVISOR_memory_op` call), explicitly free the memory for `gpfns`, `idxs`, and `errs` before jumping to `unmap`. Example adjustment:

```c
if (rc) {
    kfree(gpfns);
    kfree(idxs);
    kfree(errs);
    goto unmap;
}
```

This ensures proper cleanup of dynamically allocated resources regardless of the `HYPERVISOR_memory_op` result.
