UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `memcpy` function operates on potentially overlapping memory regions if `cmd` and `cmd_channels` point to the same structure or memory area, which would invoke undefined behavior. Standard `memcpy` does not handle overlapping memory regions properly and requires memory regions to be disjoint. For overlapping regions, `memmove` should be used instead.
  
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Safety (Undefined Behavior)
Bug Reason: Using `memcpy` on potentially overlapping memory may corrupt data in the source and destination structures, leading to unpredictable behavior. Furthermore, the size computation for `cmd->passive` and similar fields assumes that these fields are correctly sized and initialized, which the code does not explicitly guarantee. If these assumptions are violated, a buffer overflow can occur.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Replace `memcpy` with `memmove` for copying data, as `memmove` handles overlapping memory regions safely. Additionally, validate the sizes of the memory regions being copied before calling `memmove`. For example:
```c
if (sizeof(cmd->passive) <= sizeof(cmd_channels->passive)) {
    memmove(cmd->passive, cmd_channels->passive, sizeof(cmd->passive));
}
```
