Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_ubsan.c_type_bit_width.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function contains undefined behavior due to **potential left-shift overflow** in the expression `1 << (type->type_info >> 1)` if `type->type_info >> 1` evaluates to a value greater than or equal to the number of bits in an `unsigned` type on the target platform. Specifically, shifting by a value greater than or equal to the width of the type is undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Undefined Behavior Bug  
Bug Reason: The potential undefined behavior described above can result in unexpected program behavior or crashes depending on the compiler and runtime environment. This is considered a bug since it introduces instability in the program.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a bound check for the computed shift value to ensure it is less than the width of an `unsigned` type. For example:  
```c  
if ((type->type_info >> 1) >= sizeof(unsigned) * 8) {  
    // Handle the error (e.g., return a default value or log an error)  
    return 0;  
}  
return 1 << (type->type_info >> 1);  
```  
Alternatively, if it is guaranteed (and verified) that the input to this function will never violate the shift constraints, then explicitly document it in the code.
