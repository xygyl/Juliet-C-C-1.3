UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds access in `memcpy(&pp->ssid.body[0], &priv->reg.ssid.body[0], priv->reg.ssid.size);` if `priv->reg.ssid.size` exceeds the allocated size of `pp->ssid.body`. Additionally, `pp->channel_list.body[13] = 14;` may cause out-of-bounds access if `priv->reg.phy_type != D_11G_ONLY_MODE` and `pp->channel_list.body` has insufficient space allocated.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The `memcpy` and assignment to `pp->channel_list.body` risk writing outside allocated memory if the corresponding arrays exceed their expected bounds. This could corrupt adjacent memory, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `priv->reg.ssid.size` does not exceed the allocated size of `pp->ssid.body` before calling `memcpy`. Similarly, verify that `pp->channel_list.body` has adequate space allocated (at least 14 elements) before assigning to `pp->channel_list.body[13]`. Introduce sanity checks for these conditions.
