### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The variable `payload` is derived from the subtraction `FM_PWR_LVL_HIGH - new_pwr_lvl`, where both are declared as `u8`. The subtraction might result in signed integer promotion (as `u8` types are promoted to `int` during arithmetic operations in C). This introduces potential undefined behavior if `FM_PWR_LVL_HIGH` is less than `new_pwr_lvl` and the subtraction results in a negative value which cannot fit into the unsigned `u16` type that `payload` uses.
  
### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The logic of calculating `payload` assumes `FM_PWR_LVL_HIGH` will always be greater than or equal to `new_pwr_lvl`. If this assumption is violated, the subtraction could result in a negative value, wrapping around due to unsigned arithmetic. This would lead to incorrect behavior, as the `payload` would contain an unintended large value. Further, this could indirectly cause a runtime error when `fmc_send_cmd` processes the incorrect `payload` value.
  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Add bounds checks before proceeding with the subtraction to ensure `FM_PWR_LVL_HIGH >= new_pwr_lvl`. Example:
   ```c
   if (new_pwr_lvl > FM_PWR_LVL_HIGH) {
       fmdbg("Invalid power level (new_pwr_lvl > FM_PWR_LVL_HIGH)\n");
       return -EINVAL; // Return an error code for invalid input.
   }
   ```
   
2. To avoid issues stemming from integer promotion, cast both `FM_PWR_LVL_HIGH` and `new_pwr_lvl` to `u16` explicitly before subtraction:
   ```c
   payload = (u16)(FM_PWR_LVL_HIGH) - (u16)(new_pwr_lvl);
   ```
