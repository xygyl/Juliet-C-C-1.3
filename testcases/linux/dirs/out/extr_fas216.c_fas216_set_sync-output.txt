UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `target` parameter is used as an index to access the `device` array through `info->device[target]`. However, there is no check to ensure that `target` is within bounds, leading to potential undefined behavior if `target` is negative or exceeds the array's size.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the `target` parameter before using it to index the `device` array. If `target` is out of range, this will result in memory corruption or access to invalid locations in memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `target` is within the valid range of indices for the `device` array before using it. Example:
```c
if (target < 0 || target >= <device array size>) {
    return; // or handle the error appropriately
}
```
