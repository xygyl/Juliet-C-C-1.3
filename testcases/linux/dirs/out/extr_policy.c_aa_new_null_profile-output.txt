Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_policy.c_aa_new_null_profile.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `basename()` function is used incorrectly. In many implementations of `basename`, the input string may be modified (non-const), whereas the function expects a `const char *` parameter. Passing a potentially mutable string (`name` in this case) to `basename` may lead to undefined behavior since `basename` may alter its input and the function doesn't guarantee this won't happen. Additionally, there's no guarantee that `basename()` is available cross-platform in this form, creating portability issues.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw, Memory management issues
Bug Reason: 
1. **Logic Flaw**: The repeated use of `basename(name)` without ensuring the `name` buffer's integrity could lead to erroneous behavior if `basename` modifies the string.
2. **Memory Management Issue**: The `profile` allocation (via `aa_alloc_profile`) is leaked if the code reaches the `fail` label without going through `out`, leading to a potential memory leak.
Bug Caused by UB: No (The memory leak is unrelated to UB; however, the logic flaw caused due to incorrect handling of `basename` arises from UB.)
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: 
- Use a local variable to store the result of `basename(name)` to avoid repeated calls and potential modification of `name`.
- Verify `basename()` behavior to ensure it aligns with the expectations (doesn't modify its input).
- Add additional cleanup in the `fail` case to ensure `profile` is properly freed even if `name` allocation fails.
