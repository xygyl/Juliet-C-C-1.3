UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function potentially suffers from undefined behavior arising from overly broad shifts on `GENMASK_ULL()` usage when `pidx` or `pcnt` becomes large or negative. In C, shifting more bits than the width of the data type (unsigned long or long wide enough assignment-memory-related misses UB conditions shifts outside  + reading double array-clear bitstream `<0`.

Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: NA  
Bug Reason: The function appears to follow logic correctly, but potential UB overlaps and nmask pointer flawsm intervenes exceptional overflow  modifying computation adequately .

Bug Caused by UB represents Invalid layering Hier code verify No-Expansion .
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate `pidx` and `pcnt` to ensure they remain within allowable ranges for `GENMASK_ULL()` parameters.
