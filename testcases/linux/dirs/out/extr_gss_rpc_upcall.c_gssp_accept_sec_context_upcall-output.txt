UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: `data->mech_oid.data` is used in a `memcpy` operation without verifying its initialization or ensuring sufficient allocated size. If this pointer is uninitialized or points to a memory location with insufficient space, this results in undefined behavior due to memory corruption.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory corruption
Bug Reason: The use of `memcpy(data->mech_oid.data, rctxh.mech.data, data->mech_oid.len)` assumes that `data->mech_oid.data` points to a sufficient memory allocation matching `data->mech_oid.len`. However, there is no guarantee or check confirming this, which leads to possible memory buffer overflow.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion:
1. Verify `data->mech_oid.data` is properly initialized and allocated to a size at least `data->mech_oid.len` before calling `memcpy`.
2. Add checks to ensure `rctxh.mech.data` and `data->mech_oid.data` are valid non-null pointers before the memory operation.
