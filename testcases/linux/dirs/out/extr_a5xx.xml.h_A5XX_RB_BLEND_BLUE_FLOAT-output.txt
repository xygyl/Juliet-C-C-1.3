UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The right operand of the left shift operation (`util_float_to_half(val) << A5XX_RB_BLEND_BLUE_FLOAT__SHIFT`) could overflow or exceed the width of the destination type if `A5XX_RB_BLEND_BLUE_FLOAT__SHIFT` is not properly constrained and exceeds the bit-width of `uint32_t`. This would lead to undefined behavior due to shifting a value by an invalid magnitude.
Moreover, if `A5XX_RB_BLEND_BLUE_FLOAT__MASK` is not constant or aligns externally.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential Logic Flaws
