UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing a pointer that is cast to `const char **` from `const char * const[]` introduces undefined behavior. The pointer types are incompatible, and dereferencing may lead to invalid memory access. The strict aliasing rule violation occurs with the reinterpretation of object types, which the C Standard does not permit.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Strict aliasing rule violation and potential memory corruption  
Bug Reason: Misinterpreted pointer types (`const char * const[]` and `const char **`) might lead to incorrect memory accesses based on the pointer arithmetic or dereferencing behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Avoid casting `const char * const[]` to `const char **`. Instead, use memory constructs compatible with the intended pointer aliasing or redefine the arrays to be of type `const char **` consistently.

Example Fix:
```c
switch (chip_version) {
	case CHELSIO_T4:
		sge_idma_decode = &t4_decode[0];
		sge_idma_decode_nstates = ARRAY_SIZE(t4_decode);
		break;

	case CHELSIO_T5:
		sge_idma_decode = &t5_decode[0];
		sge_idma_decode_nstates = ARRAY_SIZE(t5_decode);
		break;

	case CHELSIO_T6:
		sge_idma_decode = &t6_decode[0];
		sge_idma_decode_nstates = ARRAY_SIZE(t6_decode);
		break;
	// Rest of the code remains unchanged
}
```
Alternatively, ensure all decode arrays are defined as `const char **` directly to match type expectations.
