UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing an element beyond the bounds of the `codes` array could lead to undefined behavior if `code_to_probe` exceeds `ARRAY_SIZE(codes)`. While the function checks `code_to_probe` against `ARRAY_SIZE(codes)`, an incorrect or invalid `code_to_probe` value (e.g., if it is larger than the maximum index or involves overflow calculation) may still result in UB. Specifically, `ARRAY_SIZE` might evaluate correctly but does not always ensure behavior is correct at point-of-access for all edge cases.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Access
