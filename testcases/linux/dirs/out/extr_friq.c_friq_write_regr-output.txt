UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses the value `cont_map[cont]` without validating whether `cont` is within bounds of the `cont_map` array. If `cont` is out of bounds, it results in undefined behavior due to an out-of-bounds array access.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow (Out-of-Bounds Access)  
Bug Reason: An out-of-bounds access of `cont_map` could happen if `cont` is not properly validated to lie within the bounds of the array. This could lead to reading unintended memory locations, potentially causing corruption or crashing.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check for `cont` before accessing `cont_map[cont]`. For example:
```c
if (cont < 0 || cont >= ARRAY_SIZE(cont_map)) {
    // Handle error appropriately
    return;
}
```
Replace `ARRAY_SIZE` with the appropriate macro or constant reflecting the size of `cont_map`.
