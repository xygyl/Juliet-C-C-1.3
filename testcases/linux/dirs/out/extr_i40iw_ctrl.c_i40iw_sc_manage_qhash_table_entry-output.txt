UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential array out-of-bounds access in `info->mac_addr` and `info->dest_ip`/`info->src_ip` due to unchecked bounds. The code does not verify that indices such as `info->mac_addr[5]`, `info->dest_ip[3]`, and `info->src_ip[3]` are valid, leading to undefined behavior if these arrays are smaller than the expected size. This violates the C standard and can result in memory corruption or crashes.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Array Access  
Bug Reason: The function accesses indices of arrays (`info->mac_addr`, `info->dest_ip`, `info->src_ip`) without validating their size or ensuring they are allocated correctly. This could lead to memory corruption if these indices exceed the allocated bounds. Additionally, array `info->qos` accessed with `info->user_pri` may not be validated for bounds, risking access to invalid memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to ensure `info->mac_addr`, `info->dest_ip`, `info->src_ip`, and `info->qos` meet the expected sizes. For example, validate the array length before any index-based access. Guard against invalid `info->user_pri` values by ensuring it is within valid bounds. Example:  
```c  
if (info->user_pri >= MAX_QOS_ENTRIES) {  
    return INVALID_INPUT_ERROR;  
}  
```  
Similarly:  
```c  
if (info->mac_addr == NULL || sizeof(info->mac_addr) / sizeof(info->mac_addr[0]) < 6) {  
    return INVALID_INPUT_ERROR;  
}  
```
