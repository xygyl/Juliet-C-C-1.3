UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow might occur when performing subtraction operations `tx_bytes - last_tx_bytes` and `rx_bytes - last_rx_bytes`. The C standard defines signed integer overflow as undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: The risk of signed integer overflow in the calculations of `cur_tx_bytes` and `cur_rx_bytes` can lead to incorrect logic when the byte counters wrap around, particularly for large values close to `INT_MAX`. As this overflow leads to undefined behavior, the throughput calculations (`cur_tx_tp` and `cur_rx_tp`) may yield nonsensical values.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use unsigned integer types for `tx_bytes`, `rx_bytes`, `cur_tx_bytes`, and `cur_rx_bytes` variables, as unsigned integer arithmetic does not cause undefined behavior in overflow scenarios. Alternatively, implement proper checks or assertions to prevent counter wrap-around and overflow.
