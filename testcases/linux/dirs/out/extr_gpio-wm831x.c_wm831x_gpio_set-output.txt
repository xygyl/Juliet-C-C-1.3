UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `offset` value is used as a bit shift operand (`1 << offset` and `value << offset`) without validation. If `offset` is greater than or equal to the number of bits in an integer, this causes undefined behavior as per the C standard. The result of shifting a bit beyond the size of the underlying type is undefined.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the `offset` parameter to ensure it is within the bounds of the expected GPIO bit indices. If an out-of-range `offset` is provided, the operation may inadvertently modify unrelated bits or lead to undefined behavior. This could corrupt configuration registers or result in incorrect operation.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for `offset` to ensure it is within the valid range, e.g., `if (offset >= MAX_GPIO_BITS) return;` where `MAX_GPIO_BITS` should be defined based on the system's GPIO configuration limits. Additionally, ensure the value of `offset` is a valid integer that won't exceed the width of the processor's register size used in the shift operation.
