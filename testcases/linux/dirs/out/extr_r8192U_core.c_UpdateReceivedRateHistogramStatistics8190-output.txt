Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_r8192U_core.c_UpdateReceivedRateHistogramStatistics8190.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential invalid array index access. `rateIndex` could be assigned the value `28` in the default case of the `switch(stats->rate)` statement. This value might exceed the bounds of `priv->stats.received_preamble_GI[preamble_guardinterval][rateIndex]` or `priv->stats.received_rate_histogram[rcvType][rateIndex]` if the arrays are not large enough to handle this index. Accessing out-of-bounds memory results in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow 
Bug Reason: If the `rateIndex` exceeds the size of the arrays `received_preamble_GI` or `received_rate_histogram`, it results in buffer overflow, which can corrupt memory or crash the program.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the size of `received_preamble_GI` and `received_rate_histogram` arrays accommodates all possible values of `rateIndex`, including the default case value (`28`). Alternatively, introduce a sanity check to validate `rateIndex` before accessing the arrays.
