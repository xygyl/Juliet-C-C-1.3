UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not appear to contain any operations that lead to undefined behavior according to the C standard. Specifically:  
  - There are no uses of uninitialized variables.  
  - No invalid pointer dereferencing or null pointer dereferencing occurs.  
  - There is no signed integer overflow in this function.  
  - The function and its calls appear to respect strict aliasing rules.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential NULL pointer dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not check if `common` or `buffer` pointers are NULL before using them. This could lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the caller does not provide valid non-NULL inputs.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add NULL pointer checks for both `common` and `buffer` at the beginning of the function, e.g.:  
```c
if (!common || !buffer) {
    return -EINVAL; // or some appropriate error code
}
```
