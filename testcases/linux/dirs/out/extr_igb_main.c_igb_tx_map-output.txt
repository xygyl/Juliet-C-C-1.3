Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_igb_main.c_igb_tx_map.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `dma_map_single` and `skb_frag_dma_map` functions may return an invalid or undefined DMA address in case of failure, resulting in undefined behavior when this invalid DMA address is accessed or assigned to hardware DMA descriptors.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic and memory-related bug
Bug Reason: The function does not properly check or handle the return value of `dma_map_single` and `skb_frag_dma_map` in all cases. While an error condition (via `dma_mapping_error`) is checked, the handling of the error leads to potential memory leaks and incomplete clean-up of the descriptors and buffer mappings. Additionally, failure to map DMA buffers correctly could corrupt memory or cause hardware to operate unpredictably.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add proper error handling and descriptor rollback logic in all cases where `dma_mapping_error` is detected. Ensure that all DMA mappings are reversed for cleanup and that the descriptor state is reset correctly. Validate and sanitize all inputs handling invalid DMA addresses more robustly.

Additionally, enhance the logic to ensure that no undefined behavior is triggered due to invalid DMA addresses during descriptor updates or buffer address assignments. For example:
- Immediately halt further updates to descriptors and perform a complete cleanup process as soon as any `dma_mapping_error` is detected.
- Ensure consistent resetting of `tx_buffer` mapping length, DMA addresses, and related metadata during cleanup.
