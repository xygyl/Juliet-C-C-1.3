Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_smackfs.c_load_self_seq_start.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: There is potential for undefined behavior if `smack_cred(current_cred())` returns `NULL`. Accessing the `smk_rules` field via `tsp->smk_rules` without verifying `tsp` is not null would lead to dereferencing a null pointer, which is undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `smack_cred(current_cred())` returns `NULL`, dereferencing `tsp` in `tsp->smk_rules` would cause a null pointer dereference, leading to a crash or undefined behavior during runtime.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check for `tsp` before dereferencing it. For example:
```c
if (!tsp)
    return NULL;
```
This ensures safe handling if `smack_cred(current_cred())` returns `NULL`.
