UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The expression `((val) << MDP5_PIPE_SW_PIX_EXT_TB_TOP_OVF__SHIFT)` risks undefined behavior due to potential signed integer overflow. Shifting a negative `int32_t` value left could produce an undefined result, especially if the sign bit is affected during the shift. Signed overflow is explicitly undefined behavior according to the C standard.
Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: N/A
Bug Reason: While the code contains undefined behavior, it does not contain a logic or memory-related bug aside from the UB.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use an unsigned integer type for `val` to ensure defined behavior during left shifts. E.g., change the function parameter type to `uint32_t`. Alternatively, cast `val` to `uint32_t` before shifting: `((uint32_t)val << MDP5_PIPE_SW_PIX_EXT_TB_TOP_OVF__SHIFT)`.
