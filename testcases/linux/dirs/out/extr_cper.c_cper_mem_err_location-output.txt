UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate the return value of `scnprintf`, which can result in buffer overwrites if the formatted output exceeds the size of `msg`. This leads to undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds memory access.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The `scnprintf` function writes formatted output to the `msg` buffer. If the formatted output is too large, it can exceed the remaining buffer size (`len - n`), potentially causing a buffer overflow during repeated calls. Additionally, the function assumes `msg` is always large enough to contain the formatted message without explicitly ensuring this.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Verify the return value of `scnprintf` to ensure that it does not exceed the remaining buffer space.  
2. Ensure the `msg` buffer has enough capacity to handle worst-case formatting scenarios by validating input data and adjusting buffer size if necessary.  
3. Use safer alternatives or explicitly terminate the buffer if an overflow might occur. Example fix could involve tracking `n` more carefully and checking bounds explicitly before calling `scnprintf`.

Example fix:
```c
if (mem->validation_bits & CPER_MEM_VALID_NODE) {
    int written = scnprintf(msg + n, len - n, "node: %d ", mem->node);
    if (written >= len - n) return -1; // Prevent overflow
    n += written;
}
```
This pattern should be applied for all `scnprintf` calls within the function.
