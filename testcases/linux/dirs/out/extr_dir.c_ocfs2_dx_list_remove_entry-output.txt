UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `memmove` call risks out-of-bounds memory access when `index` is invalid (e.g., greater than or equal to `num_used` or negative). The code does not properly validate `index`, which can lead to undefined behavior when accessing an invalid array position or performing a computation based on it.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access
Bug Reason: An invalid `index` can cause incorrect memory operations in `memmove` or result in corrupt data being written. For instance, if `index` is greater than the number of entries (`num_used - 1`), the `memmove` would access memory out of bounds.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Validate `index` at the start of the function to ensure it is non-negative and less than `num_used`. Add a condition, such as:
```c
if (index < 0 || index >= num_used) {
    return; // Or handle the error appropriately
}
```
This prevents undefined behavior during array access and memory manipulation.
