UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Bit-shifting an unsigned integer (`offset` or `value`) by a value that is outside the range of the type size results in undefined behavior. Since no bounds validation is applied to `offset` or `value`, if `offset >= 16` or `value >= 16` during execution, UB might occur. This is undefined as no guarantees exist under the C standard for values exceeding bit length. Another issue is possible implicit integer promotion or overflow prior to OR operations.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, potential overflow due to unbounded arguments  
Bug Reason: Logic flaws occur because `offset` and `value` are not constrained nor validated, which may cause calculation issues. The combination of shifting and ORing has a potential for incorrect results due mathematical flaws. patterns tokens integer remainsed  
Bug Caused by adding above!, please clarified. atleast promo exists!  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `offset` and `value` are correctly bounded, e.g., `offset <= 0xFFF` and `value <= 0xFF`, before performing operations. Consider enforcing maximum range guards at the start of the function.
