Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_utilannotate.h_annotated_source__histogram.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The pointer arithmetic in the expression `((void *)src->histograms) + (src->sizeof_sym_hist * idx)` can invoke undefined behavior if `src->histograms` is `NULL`. Dereferencing or performing arithmetic on a `NULL` pointer is undefined behavior according to the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: If `src->histograms` is `NULL`, attempting to perform pointer arithmetic on it will likely result in unintended behavior or a crash. Additionally, the computed address would not be valid, leading to potential use of uninitialized or corrupted memory.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `src->histograms` is non-`NULL` before performing the pointer arithmetic. For example:
```c
if (src->histograms == NULL) {
    return NULL; // Handle the error appropriately
}
return ((void *)src->histograms) + (src->sizeof_sym_hist * idx);
```
