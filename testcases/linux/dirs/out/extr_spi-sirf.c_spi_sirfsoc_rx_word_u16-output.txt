### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential dereferencing of a null pointer (`rx`), which can result in undefined behavior. If `sspi->rx` is `NULL`, then the operation inside the `if (rx)` block dereferences a null pointer, which is explicitly undefined behavior under the C standard.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The code does not validate whether `sspi->rx` is guaranteed to be non-NULL before accessing it. While the `if (rx)` condition checks `rx` against `NULL`, it modifies the pointer `sspi->rx` without re-establishing if any subsequent use of `rx` is safe outside of this function. In addition, this potentially violates data integrity rules, as pointer arithmetic on unvalidated pointers often leads to unstable behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  
The undefined behavior and related bug are very apparent based on the provided code's logical flow and checks.

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Ensure that `sspi->rx` is initialized to a valid pointer and checked at higher layers before invoking this function.
2. Enforce appropriate contracts for `sspi->rx` initialization or, if `sspi->rx` can indeed be `NULL`, avoid manipulating it and return early:
```c
if (!sspi->rx) {
    sspi->left_rx_word--;
    return;
}
```
This prevents the null pointer dereference.
