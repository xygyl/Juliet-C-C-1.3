### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function may encounter undefined behavior due to improper handling of array boundaries. Specifically:  
1. `sensor->objs[i]` is accessed within multiple loops, but the boundary condition `abs_fingers` does not explicitly ensure `i < sensor->nbr_fingers`, creating a potential for out-of-bounds access on the `objs` array.  
2. Integer division in expressions like `size / RMI_F11_ABS_BYTES` could lead to unintended incorrect behavior if `RMI_F11_ABS_BYTES` were zero, though it is a macro and appears defined as a non-zero value elsewhere.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The code improperly calculates and uses indexes (`i`) into arrays like `sensor->objs` and `f_state` without enforcing strict boundaries that guard against out-of-bounds reads. For example, `abs_fingers = size / RMI_F11_ABS_BYTES` does not ensure that the calculated value respects the actual size of the `sensor->objs` array. Subsequent accesses like `sensor->objs[i]` risk buffer overflows.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Validate array access indices explicitly:  
   ```c
   if (i >= sensor->nbr_fingers) {
       continue;
   }
   ```  
   Add this check before accessing array elements like `sensor->objs[i]`, especially in the loop iterating up to `abs_fingers`.

2. Explicitly verify that `sensor->nbr_fingers` and `size / RMI_F11_ABS_BYTES` cannot lead to mismatched or inconsistent calculations, ensuring access remains confined within allocated bounds.

3. Add additional logging or assertions (e.g., `BUG_ON` in the kernel context) to detect abnormal conditions during development.
