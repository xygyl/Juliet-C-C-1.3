UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible out-of-bounds memory access occurs if `ie[TLV_LEN_OFF]` evaluates to a value that results in an overflow beyond the size of the `ie` buffer while accessing via indices like `ie[TLV_BODY_OFF]` or `ie[TLV_BODY_OFF + oui_len]`. This happens because the size of `ie` is not checked against the computed offset.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds memory access  
Bug Reason: The function lacks bounds checking for `*ie` and ensures no access goes beyond the end of the `ie` buffer. This could corrupt or read unintended memory, causing issues like crashes or incorrect behavior. Specifically, if `ie[TLV_LEN_OFF]` plus `oui_len + 1` exceeds the allocated length of the `ie` buffer, subsequent calls like `memcmp` can cause undefined behavior. Additionally, decrementing `*tlvs_len` in cases of `ie` overflow without validating results can create logic errors.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate the value of `ie[TLV_LEN_OFF]` against the length of the `ie` buffer before performing the condition checks or accessing `ie`. For instance:
```c
if (ie[TLV_LEN_OFF] >= oui_len + 1 && 
    *tlvs_len >= TLV_HDR_LEN + ie[TLV_LEN_OFF] &&
    !memcmp(&ie[TLV_BODY_OFF], oui, oui_len) &&
    type == ie[TLV_BODY_OFF + oui_len]) {
    return true;
}
```
Also, ensure bounds validation occurs for `ie` before assigning or modifying `*tlvs` or `*tlvs_len`.
