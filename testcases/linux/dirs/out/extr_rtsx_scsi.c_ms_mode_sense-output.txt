UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: 
1. **Buffer Overflow**:
   - The function accesses and writes to the external `buf` array without verifying that the computed `i` index does not exceed `buf_len`. This may lead to out-of-bounds memory write if `buf_len` is smaller than the data being copied into `buf`.
   - Specifically, there are multiple points where `buf` is indexed directly after checking `data_size`, but `i` is not always controlled relative to `buf_len`. In particular, no checks ensure `sys_info_offset` and the subsequent `memcpy` operation stay within bounds of both `buf_len` and the array's size.

2. **Possibly Misaligned Pointer Access**:
   - The use of `ms_card->raw_sys_info` via `memcpy(buf + sys_info_offset, ms_card->raw_sys_info, len)` may lead to undefined behavior if `ms_card->raw_sys_info` is not guaranteed to be appropriately aligned for a `u8`-buffer operation.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: 
1. **Memory Write Outside Allocated Region**:
   - The calculation of `data_size`, `sys_info_offset`, and subsequent usages of `memcpy` do not ensure the safety of the external `buf` array. If the computed values exceed the allocated array size of `buf`, memory corruption may occur.

2. **Logic Error in `data_size` and `len` Handling**:
   - The calculation of `len = data_size - sys_info_offset` assumes that `sys_info_offset` and subsequent processing are valid. If `buf_len` is very small, this calculation could produce invalid memory accesses.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Add explicit checks on the `i` index alongside `buf_len` before writing to `buf`.
   ```c
   if (i >= buf_len) {
       // Error handling or truncation logic
   }
   ```
2. Ensure that `ms_card->raw_sys_info` is properly aligned before performing a `memcpy`.

3. Validate `sys_info_offset` and adjust bounds to ensure safety:
   ```c
   if (data_size > buf_len) {
       data_size = buf_len;
   }
   int len = (data_size - sys_info_offset);
   if (len > 96) {
       len = 96;
   }
   if (sys_info_offset + len > buf_len) {
       len = buf_len - sys_info_offset;  // Adjust to buffer bounds
   }
   memcpy(buf + sys_info_offset, ms_card->raw_sys_info, len);
   ```
4. Add safer memory-boundary checks at all critical buffer operations.
