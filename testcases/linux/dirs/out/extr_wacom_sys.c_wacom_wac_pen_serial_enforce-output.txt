UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: In `offset + j * size`, there is a risk of integer overflow when computing the memory offset. Additionally, `raw_data+1` dereferences one byte past the pointer `raw_data`, which could potentially lead to undefined behavior if the pointer doesn't point to a contiguous memory allocation large enough for the reference. Furthermore, potential shift overflow exists in `(__u64)value) << 32`. If the size of `value` exceeds or mismatches with the data-type length, this operation could produce undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow, Shift Overflow, Memory Access Out-of-Bounds  
Bug Reason: While the function computes `offset + j * size` and accesses `raw_data+1`, there's a potential for accessing memory beyond valid bounds, which may lead to undefined behavior. The operations related to `(__u64)value) << 32` also have the likelihood of causing data corruption if the shift causes a wraparound effect due to exceeding type limitations.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
- Validate the values of `offset`, `j`, and `size` before computing `offset + j * size` to ensure no integer overflow occurs.  
- Ensure `raw_data+1` points to valid and correctly allocated memory by verifying its size and bounds beforehand.  
- Perform a bounds check for the shifting operation `(__u64)value << 32` to ensure the data stays within the representable range of a 64-bit unsigned integer. This could be done via masking or range assertions.
