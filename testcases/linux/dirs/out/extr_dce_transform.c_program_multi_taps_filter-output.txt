UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The pointer `coeffs` is dereferenced in the `for` loop without a proper null check or handling in the code block after the `if (!coeffs) return` check. This doesn't guarantee that `coeffs` remains valid during execution. Additionally:
1. Implicit integer promotion may happen when accessing and assigning to `uint16_t odd_coeff` and `uint16_t even_coeff`, but this itself isn’t undefined behavior unless overflows occur.
2. Array indexing (`coeffs[array_idx]`) can potentially result in out‐of‐bounds access if the `coeffs` array size is smaller than expected due to algorithm misconfiguration or oversight. Without explicit boundary checks, this is a source of UB.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Possible buffer overrun, Logical error  
Bug Reason: The `coeffs` array may be accessed out of bounds in the following scenarios:
1. The calculation of `taps_pairs = (taps + 1) / 2` and subsequent use of `array_idx` could lead to an invalid memory access if `taps` is derived incorrectly or `coeffs` doesn't have sufficient elements for the iteration logic.
2. The computation `if (taps % 2 && pair == taps_pairs - 1)` may inadvertently skip necessary pairs for odd values of `taps`, introducing logic bugs for handling uneven coefficients.  
Bug Caused by UB: Possibly Yes  
Confidence: Medium  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add explicit boundary checks to ensure the `coeffs` array contains enough elements before accessing `coeffs[array_idx]`. For example:
   ```c
   if (array_idx >= predefined_coeff_limit) {
       return; // or handle the error gracefully
   }
   ```
2. Introduce additional safeguards or restructuring to the logic for odd values of `taps`—validate that memory accesses in the code prevent misalignment and unintentional indexing errors.
