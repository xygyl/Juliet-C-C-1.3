### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing `gate_name[i]` without validating can lead to undefined behavior if it contains a null pointer. In the loop that calls `cp110_register_gate`, there is a check for `if (gate_name[i] == NULL)` to skip null pointers, but subsequent code still attempts to call `cp110_unregister_gate(hw)` during cleanup (`fail_gate`) for all indices, which may include uninitialized or null pointers at `cp110_clks[CP110_MAX_CORE_CLOCKS + i]`. Similarly, dereferencing `regmap` without verifying it isn't null is acceptable because the `syscon_node_to_regmap` function already checks for failures using `IS_ERR`.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw / Memory Related  
Bug Reason: The allocation of `gate_name` occurs dynamically for each clock in `ARRAY_SIZE(gate_base_names)`.
