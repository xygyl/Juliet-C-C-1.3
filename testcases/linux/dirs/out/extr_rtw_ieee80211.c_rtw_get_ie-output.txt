UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Dereferencing `p` without validating if it goes out of bounds of the `pbuf` buffer. Specifically, there are potential out-of-bounds reads when accessing `*p` and `*(p + 1)` if `p` exceeds the range defined by `pbuf` and `limit`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The function does not check if `p` plus the calculated offset exceeds the `limit` while advancing the pointer inside the loop. This can lead to the pointer accessing memory outside of the valid range and cause a buffer overflow.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Introduce boundary checks before dereferencing `p` and `*(p + 1)` to ensure they stay within the buffer's valid range. For example:
```c
if (i + 2 > limit) {
    return NULL;
}
```
Additionally:
1. Ensure that `*(p + 1)`, which represents the length field, is validated to avoid advancing `p` by an invalid amount.
2. Combine checks to validate `tmp` (the extracted length) and ensure additions to `p` do not exceed the `limit`.
