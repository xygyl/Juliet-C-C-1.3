UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing a potentially null pointer (`ws`) within the function without validation. If `ws` is passed as `NULL`, accessing `ws->bits` would result in undefined behavior as per the C standard.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference potential  
Bug Reason: The function lacks validation of the `ws` pointer before accessing its `bits` member. If `ws` is `NULL`, the behavior is undefined, and it may cause a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check at the beginning of the function, such as:  
```c
if (!ws)
    return;
```  
This prevents the function from attempting to access a `NULL` pointer.
