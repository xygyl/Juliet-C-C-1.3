UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential null pointer dereference of `hcrypt` in `if (!hcrypt)` conditional. If `hcrypt` is null, dereferencing its fields later (`hcrypt->lock` or `hcrypt->algs`) will result in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null pointer dereference
Bug Reason: The `hcrypt` pointer is not validated properly throughout the function execution. While `if (!hcrypt)` will return `-1` for null `hcrypt`, subsequent accesses (e.g., `hcrypt->lock`) do not consider this null state, leading to potential null pointer dereference.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a `return -1;` immediately after the `if (!hcrypt)` condition to ensure the function exits early when `hcrypt` is null. This prevents any further dereferencing of `hcrypt`.

Example Fix:
```c
if (!hcrypt)
    return -1;
```
