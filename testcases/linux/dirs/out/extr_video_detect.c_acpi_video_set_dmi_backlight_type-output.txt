Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_video_detect.c_acpi_video_set_dmi_backlight_type.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Assignment to `acpi_backlight_dmi` may result in undefined behavior if `type` is an invalid or uninitialized value. If `type` can be controlled externally and its value is unspecified or outside the enumeration's expected range, the violation of the enumeration type could manifest as UB.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The function assumes that the output of `acpi_video_get_backlight_type` (which returns a `scalar_t__` value) will correctly compare with `acpi_backlight_video`. If `acpi_video_get_backlight_type` returns an invalid or unexpected value, the comparison may yield incorrect results or cause unintended side effects. Additionally, the logic does not account for error conditions in `acpi_video_unregister_backlight`, which should ideally be checked to ensure graceful error handling.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `type` is explicitly validated against expected enumeration values. Additionally, sanitize the output of `acpi_video_get_backlight_type` before using it for comparison. Introduce error handling for `acpi_video_unregister_backlight` to verify successful execution.
