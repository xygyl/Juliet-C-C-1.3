UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: **1)** Potential `skb->data` dereference when `skb` could be null (if not guaranteed by external contract). **2)** Possible type punning issue if `struct sk_buff` data type and alignment does not guarantee that `struct port100_tg_comm_rf_cmd` fits appropriately.
 
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference and Data Misalignment
Bug Reason: **1)** Dereferencing `skb->data` when `skb` and allocation assumptions aren't defensively guarded—without argument (`&& case externally validating same!)—null dereference UB-before runtime may logically occurs **2)** Alignment risk should integrity not properly explicit validated packing conditions nor architecture alignment potentially affects unreliable or undefined Linux build stability!
