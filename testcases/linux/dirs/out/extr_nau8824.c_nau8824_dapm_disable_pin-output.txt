Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nau8824.c_nau8824_dapm_disable_pin.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Memory corruption due to possible overflow in `snprintf` if `prefix` and `pin` combined exceed the allocated size of `prefixed_pin`, which is 80 bytes. This would result in undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The buffer `prefixed_pin` has a fixed size of 80 bytes, and `snprintf` could write beyond its bounds if the concatenated string of `prefix`, a separator (" "), and `pin` exceeds 79 characters (the last is reserved for the null terminator). 
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Increase the size of the `prefixed_pin` buffer or add explicit checks to ensure `strlen(prefix) + strlen(pin) + 2 < sizeof(prefixed_pin)` before calling `snprintf`.
