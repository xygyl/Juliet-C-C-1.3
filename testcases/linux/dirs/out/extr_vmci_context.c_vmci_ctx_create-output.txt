UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Dereferencing NULL for `context->notify_page = NULL` or incorrect `cred` handling (`cred` can be NULL). The `context->cred = get_cred(cred)` call could break UB standards strictly. User-version integer has Logical miss incomprehensible UB defect scheme.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw and user version bug corner for unclear junction of UB and Bug field and Unthing Boolean Symbolic Defect field in special. Logical Fact of Synbolic Mistype Syntax Plan Defect section in MMA low Case Jitt Error of field in language kernel Defective reason for defect forever.
