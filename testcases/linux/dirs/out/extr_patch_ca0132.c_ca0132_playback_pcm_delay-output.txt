UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: `spec->effects_switch` is accessed without verifying that it is non-NULL. If `spec->effects_switch` is NULL, this results in undefined behavior due to a null pointer dereference.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the `spec->effects_switch` pointer for nullity before dereferencing it. If `effects_switch` is NULL, accessing its elements causes a segmentation fault, leading to application crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check:  

```c
if (!spec || !spec->effects_switch)  
    return 0;  
```

This will ensure that `spec` and the `effects_switch` pointer are valid before accessing them.
