UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses `IS_ERR_OR_NULL(tracer)` unchecked. If `tracer` is a pointer cast to `scalar_t__` (arithmetic type), applying pointer logic in the macro can lead to undefined behavior as per strict aliasing rules. Also, explicit checks may fail against `NULL` if `NULL` is redefined incorrectly.
