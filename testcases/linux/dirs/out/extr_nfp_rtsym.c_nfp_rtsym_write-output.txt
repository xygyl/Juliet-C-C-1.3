Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_nfp_rtsym.c_nfp_rtsym_write.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function dereferences the `cpp` and `sym` parameters, but these parameters are not explicitly checked for `NULL`. If either of these pointers is `NULL`, dereferencing them causes undefined behavior as per the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: Without `NULL` checks, any call to `nfp_rtsym_write()` with a `NULL` value for the `cpp` or `sym` arguments will lead to a null pointer dereference, which is a runtime bug. If `cpp` or `sym` are null, it's likely the `__nfp_rtsym_write` function would crash upon access.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add explicit `NULL` checks for both `cpp` and `sym` before calling `__nfp_rtsym_write`:

```c
if (!cpp || !sym)
    return -EINVAL; // Or appropriate error code
```
