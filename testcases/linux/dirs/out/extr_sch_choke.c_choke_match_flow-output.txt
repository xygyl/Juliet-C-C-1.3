Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_sch_choke.c_choke_match_flow.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `make_flow_keys_digest` and `skb_flow_dissect_flow_keys` functions appear to operate with potentially uninitialized memory. Specifically, they depend on `&temp`, which is a local uninitialized variable of type `struct flow_keys`. Accessing an uninitialized variable causes undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug, Undefined Behavior Memory Access  
Bug Reason: The `temp` variable is passed into `skb_flow_dissect_flow_keys` and `make_flow_keys_digest` without being initialized prior to its usage. This can lead to unpredictable results and potentially corrupt memory or incorrect flow key computation.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Initialize the `temp` structure to zero or appropriate initial values before passing it to the functions `skb_flow_dissect_flow_keys` and `make_flow_keys_digest`. Example:  

```c
struct flow_keys temp = {0};
```
Alternatively, implement proper initialization functions or defaults for `struct flow_keys` as required by its expected use case.
