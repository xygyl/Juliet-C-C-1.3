### Undefined Behavior (UB) Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: In the `delete_queues` loop, the decrement operation (`i--`) will result in an invalid array access (`ctrl->queues[-1]`) if `i == 0`. Accessing memory outside the bounds of an array is undefined behavior. Neither the provided code nor the caller ensures that the `ctrl->queues` array adheres to bounds during such scenarios.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error, Out-of-Bounds Memory Access  
Bug Reason: The `delete_queues` loop will attempt to delete queue 0 (`i == 0`) and then continue decrementing `i`, attempting to access `ctrl->queues[-1]`, which is out-of-bounds. This can cause a memory access violation or undefined behavior at runtime.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Restrict the `delete_queues` loop to valid indices by modifying its range:
```c
delete_queues:
    for (; i > 0; i--)
        __nvme_fc_delete_hw_queue(ctrl, &ctrl->queues[i], i);
    __nvme_fc_delete_hw_queue(ctrl, &ctrl->queues[0], 0); // Explicitly handle queue 0
```

This fix ensures that the loop does not access array elements outside valid bounds and explicitly handles queue 0 before exiting the loop.
