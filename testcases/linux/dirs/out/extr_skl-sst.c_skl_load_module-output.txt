Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_skl-sst.c_skl_load_module.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `snprintf` format specifier `%pUL` is non-standard and may result in undefined behavior. The `%p` format specifier is defined by the C standard for pointer representations, but appending "UL" does not conform to the standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: There is no explicit check to ensure `guid` is non-null before dereferencing it in `snprintf`. If `guid` is `NULL`, this will result in undefined behavior and potentially a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: 
1. Modify the format specifier in `snprintf` to adhere to the standard. For example, use a valid method to format a GUID properly (depending on how `guid` is represented).
2. Add explicit checks to ensure `guid` and other pointers (e.g., `module_entry` and `module_entry->mod_info->fw`) are non-null before dereferencing them. For `guid`, include:
   ```c
   if (guid == NULL) {
       dev_err(ctx->dev, "GUID is NULL\n");
       return -EINVAL;
   }
   ```
