Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_gf100.c_gf100_gr_oneinit_sm_id.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `gr->sm_nr` is used to index into the `gr->sm` array without verifying that `gr->sm_nr` remains within bounds of the allocated `gr->sm` array. This may result in undefined behavior due to an out-of-bounds array access.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: If `gr->sm_nr` exceeds the bounds of the `gr->sm` array, it can result in memory corruption when accessing or writing to `gr->sm[gr->sm_nr]`. This behavior is tied to the lack of bounds checks for the `gr->sm` array in the nested loops.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `gr->sm_nr` is checked to be less than the allocated size of the `gr->sm` array before any access or manipulation of `gr->sm[gr->sm_nr]`. For example:
```c
if (gr->sm_nr < sm_size) {  // 'sm_size' should represent the size of the allocated 'gr->sm' array.
    gr->sm[gr->sm_nr].gpc = gpc;
    gr->sm[gr->sm_nr].tpc = tpc;
    gr->sm_nr++;
}
```
Alternatively, ensure all relevant arrays (`gr->sm`, `gr->tpc_nr`, etc.) have their memory correctly initialized and sized to handle the maximum possible values of `gr->tpc_max` and `gr->gpc_nr`.
