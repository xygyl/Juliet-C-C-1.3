UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: **Accessing an array using an index that could potentially be out-of-bounds.** The `alloc_counter()` function returns an index (`hwc->idx`) and this value is directly used as the array index (`tx2_pmu->events[hwc->idx] = event;`). If `alloc_counter()` returns a value greater than or equal to the size of the `events` array or is negative (though it is checked for `< 0` initially), this can result in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: **Out-of-bounds array access**  
Bug Reason: As explained in "UB Reason", the code assigns `event` to `tx2_pmu->events[hwc->idx]` without ensuring `hwc->idx` is within valid bounds for the `events` array. If `alloc_counter()` incorrectly provides a value outside the valid range, this causes the program to write beyond the bounds of the array, leading to memory corruption or segmentation faults.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `alloc_counter()` always returns a valid index range that is guaranteed to be within the bounds of the `tx2_pmu->events` array. For additional safety, validate `hwc->idx` before performing the assignment:  
```c
if (hwc->idx < 0 || hwc->idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(tx2_pmu->events))  
    return -EAGAIN;  
tx2_pmu->events[hwc->idx] = event;  
```  
Here, `ARRAY_SIZE(tx2_pmu->events)` should compute the size of the `events` array.
