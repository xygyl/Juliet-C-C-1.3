UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The variable `status` in the expression `status < 0 || status != BTMTK_WMT_ON_PROGRESS` during the `readx_poll_timeout` call can be accessed uninitialized on certain paths. This occurs if `mtk_hci_wmt_sync` fails, and `status` has not been reliably set before the conditional evaluation. Uninitialized variable access is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Uninitialized variable use  
Bug Reason: The variable `status` may be uninitialized when interacting with `readx_poll_timeout`. If `mtk_hci_wmt_sync` or the prior firmware-check logic fails, subsequent checks involving `status` are invalid unless explicitly initialized. This can lead to unpredictable behavior.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Initialize `status` to a default value at the declaration point (e.g., `int status = 0;`). This ensures predictable behavior even if earlier function calls fail to set a valid value.
