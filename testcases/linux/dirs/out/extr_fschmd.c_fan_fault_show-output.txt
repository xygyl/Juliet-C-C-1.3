Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_3/extr_fschmd.c_fan_fault_show.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing `data->fan_status[index]` without validating `index` could cause undefined behavior if `index` is out of bounds for the `data->fan_status` array. The behavior of accessing out-of-bounds array elements is undefined in C.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out‐of‐bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The `index` variable derived from `to_sensor_dev_attr(devattr)->index` is used to access `data->fan_status[index]` without bounds checking. If `index` is greater than or equal to the size of the `data->fan_status` array or negative, this could lead to accessing invalid memory, potentially causing a crash or unpredictable behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate `index` to ensure it falls within the bounds of the `data->fan_status` array before using it as an index. For example:
```c
if (index < 0 || index >= ARRAY_SIZE(data->fan_status)) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return an error code for invalid index.
}
```
Also, ensure the array `fan_status` size is known and consistently used during validation.
