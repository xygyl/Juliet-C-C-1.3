UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: `sprintf(node, "node%d", hive->number_devices);` may lead to a buffer overflow if `hive->number_devices` is a value requiring more than 9 characters to represent (e.g., values >= 10^9). This violates the C standard by writing beyond the bounds of the array `node`, which has a fixed size of 10.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The `node` character array may be overflowed because there is no check to ensure that the formatted string fits within `node[10]`. This could lead to undefined behavior and potentially corrupt surrounding memory.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use `snprintf(node, sizeof(node), "node%d", hive->number_devices);` to ensure the formatted string never exceeds the buffer size and is safely truncated.
