Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_ir-rx51.c_ir_rx51_set_duty_cycle.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing the `dev->priv` pointer without checking if `dev` or `dev->priv` is NULL constitutes undefined behavior if either pointer is null.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether the `dev` pointer or the `dev->priv` pointer is NULL before dereferencing them. This could lead to a crash if the function is called with invalid input.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add NULL pointer checks for `dev` and `dev->priv` at the start of the function, returning an appropriate error code (e.g., `-EINVAL`).

Suggested fix:
```c
static int ir_rx51_set_duty_cycle(struct rc_dev *dev, u32 duty)
{
	if (!dev || !dev->priv)
		return -EINVAL;

	struct ir_rx51 *ir_rx51 = dev->priv;
	ir_rx51->duty_cycle = duty;

	return 0;
}
```
