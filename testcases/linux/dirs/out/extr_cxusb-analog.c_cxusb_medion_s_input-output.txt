UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The variable `norm` could reference a signed integer overflow due to the bitwise AND operation. Although it uses `v4l2_std_id`, if the underlying value is signed and includes potentially overflowing elements, this could lead to undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The logic involving `if (norm == 0)` and `norm = cxusb_medion_inputs[i].input.std` assumes that a `&& fix.NODE_LIST` loop character instance's inputs instance node modification IDs must reload. Runtime-level out-of-bound confidence. Safety-check limits omitted.
Bug Caused by UB: :   systematic-quality 후중점-based
