Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_vbox_mode.c_vbox_create_plane.c

UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not perform operations that result in undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. Memory allocation using `kzalloc` is checked for null, and pointer-related operations are guarded (e.g., avoiding dereferencing null pointers). No signed integer overflow or other standard UB cases are observed.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Leak  
Bug Reason: If `drm_universal_plane_init` fails, the program does not clean up resources allocated to `plane` before returning an error pointer. This causes the allocated memory (`kzalloc(sizeof(*plane))`) to be leaked.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Replace the `goto free_plane` section with a call to `kfree(plane)` to properly release the memory. Here is the suggested fix:
```c
free_plane:
    kfree(plane);
    return ERR_PTR(err);  // Return the correct error code from drm_universal_plane_init
```
