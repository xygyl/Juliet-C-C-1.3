Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_1/extr_adm1025.c_in_min_store.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The code does not check for buffer overflows when accessing `data->in_min` using `index`. If `index` is out of bounds for the `data->in_min` array, this will lead to undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds memory access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: The calculation and use of `index` does not ensure it is within the valid range for the `data->in_min` array, which can lead to violating memory safety.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check for `index` before using it to access elements of `data->in_min`:
```c
if (index < 0 || index >= ARRAY_SIZE(data->in_min)) {
    return -EINVAL; // or an appropriate error code
}
```
ARRAY_SIZE could be a macro or constant that represents the size of the `data->in_min` array.
