Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_6/extr_pinctrl-ssbi-mpp.c_pm8xxx_mpp_get.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Accessing out-of-bound array index `offset` on `pctrl->desc.pins[offset]` can invoke undefined behavior if `offset` exceeds the bounds of `pins[]`. This is UB since it depends on values external to this function that are not validated here.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: The function assumes `offset` is within valid bounds but does not perform any checks to ensure this. If `offset` is invalid, accessing `pctrl->desc.pins[offset]` can corrupt memory or cause a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate `offset` to ensure it is less than the size of the `pins` array before accessing it. You can add a check like:  
```c
if (offset >= ARRAY_SIZE(pctrl->desc.pins)) {  
    return -EINVAL; // Return an appropriate error for invalid offset  
}
```
