UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences the pointer `ptr` without checking if it is null, leading to potential undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference if `ptr == NULL`. Furthermore, decrementing `ptr` repeatedly risks accessing memory outside the bounds of the array it originally points to, which is also undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference, Out-of-Bounds Memory Access  
Bug Reason: If `ptr` is passed as null, dereferencing `*(--ptr)` will cause a null pointer dereference. Additionally, `ptr += 6` followed by multiple `--ptr` operations might read memory beyond the bounds of the allocated space for the `ptr` array, causing potential out-of-bounds access.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add a null pointer check for `ptr` at the start of the function:
   ```c
   if (ptr == NULL) {
       return 0; // or handle error
   }
   ```

2. Ensure the array pointed to by `ptr` has at least 6 bytes allocated before performing modifications on it:
   ```c
   // Example:
   if (ptr_size < 6) {
       // handle error case
   }
   ```

3. Document explicitly that the caller must pass a valid pointer to an array of at least 6 bytes.
