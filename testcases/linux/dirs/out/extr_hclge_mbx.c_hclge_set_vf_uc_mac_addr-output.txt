UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function directly casts portions of the `msg` array in `mbx_req` to a `const u8` pointer without validation. If `msg` does not hold enough elements (e.g., `msg[2]` or `msg[8]`), accessing these indices results in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access. Additionally, dereferencing the cast pointer leads to UB if the data at these locations is not valid memory.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: As outlined in the UB Reason, the function assumes the buffer `msg` in the `mbx_req` structure is sufficiently large to safely access indices 2 and 8, but this is not validated. If `msg` is smaller or improperly initialized, memory corruption or crashes may occur. Similar risks exist when manipulating `mac_addr` or `old_addr` derived from this potentially invalid memory.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate the size of the `msg` array before accessing specific indices. For example, ensure `msg` contains at least 9 elements when accessing `msg[8]`. Returning `-EIO` or a similar error code if the size check fails would prevent UB and associated bugs.

Additional Comments: This function relies on external inputs (`mbx_req`'s `msg` array) and manipulates dynamically derived pointers (`mac_addr`). Ensuring adequate input validation is critical for safe execution.
