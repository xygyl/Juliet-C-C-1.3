Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_module.c_duplicate_reloc.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Out-of-bounds array access occurs when `i` equals `num`, because `rela[num].r_info` and `rela[num].r_addend` are accessed, which exceed the valid range of the array when used with `num`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: The access `rela[num].r_info` and `rela[num].r_addend` in the comparison creates a logic flaw since the loop intends to compare elements within the bounds of the array (`rela[0]` to `rela[num - 1]`). However, `rela[num]` is beyond the valid range, leading to undefined behavior and potential memory corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: The comparison `rela[i].r_info == rela[num].r_info && rela[i].r_addend == rela[num].r_addend` is invalid when `i == num`. Replace `num` with `num - 1` in the loop condition to ensure that `rela[num - 1]` is the last element compared. Alternatively, adjust logic to avoid accessing `rela[num]` entirely, which is out-of-bounds.
