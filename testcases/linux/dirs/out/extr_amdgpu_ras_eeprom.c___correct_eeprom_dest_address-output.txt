UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `DRM_DEBUG_DRIVER` macro uses `%lx` for formatting `next_address & EEPROM_ADDR_MSB_MASK`, but `next_address` is a `uint32_t`. This leads to undefined behavior in the form of incorrect type casting: `%lx` expects `unsigned long` (which is typically 64-bit on modern platforms) but `next_address` is 32-bit. This mismatch can result in unpredictable output or runtime errors depending on the platform.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The logic for handling the case of page boundary crossing (`if ((curr_address & EEPROM_ADDR_MSB_MASK) != (next_address & EEPROM_ADDR_MSB_MASK))`) could potentially lead to an incorrect address calculation if `next_address` resides slightly beyond the boundary but does not align to the beginning of the next 256-byte page. The function does not ensure proper alignment when jumping to the next page.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Use `%x` or `%#x` instead of `%lx` in the `DRM_DEBUG_DRIVER` format string since `next_address & EEPROM_ADDR_MSB_MASK` is a `uint32_t`.  
2. Adjust the logic to ensure proper page alignment when crossing page boundaries. Specifically, it should calculate the correct start address for the next page by applying a bitmask or round-down logic, rather than simply returning `(next_address & EEPROM_ADDR_MSB_MASK)`.

Fixed snippet:  
```c
if ((curr_address & EEPROM_ADDR_MSB_MASK) != (next_address & EEPROM_ADDR_MSB_MASK)) {
    DRM_DEBUG_DRIVER("Reached end of EEPROM memory page, jumping to next: %#x",
                     (next_address & EEPROM_ADDR_MSB_MASK));
    return (next_address & EEPROM_ADDR_MSB_MASK); // Ensure alignment is correct
}
```
