Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_ccwgroup.c_ccwgroup_pm_restore.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `to_ccwgroupdev()` or `to_ccwgroupdrv()` return `NULL`, attempting to dereference these pointers (e.g., `gdev->dev.driver`, `gdrv->restore`) leads to undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The code does not check whether the outcomes of `to_ccwgroupdev()` and `to_ccwgroupdrv()` are NULL before dereferencing them. This creates a potential for a null pointer dereference if the device or driver is unavailable or invalid.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Introduce null pointer checks immediately after calling `to_ccwgroupdev()` and `to_ccwgroupdrv()`. For instance:
```c
if (!gdev || !gdrv)
    return 0;
```
