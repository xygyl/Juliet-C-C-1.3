UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function performs array accesses on the `buffer` variable without prior verification that the array size matches the required space in `hdmi_avi_infoframe_pack()` for packing the AVI infoframe. If the packing function writes beyond the buffer's allocated size, undefined behavior will occur. `sizeof(buffer)` not being large enough can lead to a buffer overflow scenario, which is UB according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The size of `buffer` (defined as `HDMI_INFOFRAME_HEADER_SIZE + HDMI_AVI_INFOFRAME_SIZE`) is passed to `hdmi_avi_infoframe_pack()`. If `hdmi_avi_infoframe_pack()` requires a buffer larger than this size for packing, a buffer overflow could occur. While assumptions seem to exist about the buffer size being sufficient, these assumptions are latent risks and could lead to undefined memory writes. The actual packing logic in `hdmi_avi_infoframe_pack()` needs to ensure size checks.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add error handling in `hdmi_avi_infoframe_pack()` to verify that it does not write past the allocated size of the buffer. Alternatively, in `radeon_audio_set_avi_packet()`, ensure the `sizeof(buffer)` provided to `hdmi_avi_infoframe_pack()` is verified against the actual requirements of the packing function.
