UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate the `ptr` parameter, which may be `NULL`. Dereferencing `ptr[i]` would lead to undefined behavior if `ptr` is `NULL`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: If `ptr` is `NULL`, accessing `ptr[i]` will cause a null pointer dereference, potentially leading to segmentation faults or crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `ptr` is non-NULL at the beginning of the function, e.g., `if (!ptr) { return 0; }`.
