### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences `dma->active` without checking if the `dma` pointer returned by `dma_channel(chan)` is `NULL`. If `dma_channel(chan)` returns `NULL`, dereferencing `dma->active` results in undefined behavior due to null pointer dereference.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: A potential null pointer dereference exists when accessing `dma->active`. If `dma_channel(chan)` returns `NULL` for any given `chan`, the program would attempt to dereference `NULL`, which would typically cause a runtime crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  
The issue is clear in the code, as `dma_channel(chan)` is called and the return value (`dma`) is dereferenced without validation.

### Fix Suggestion:
Add a check for `NULL` before dereferencing `dma`. For example:
```c
int dma_channel_active(unsigned int chan)
{
    dma_t *dma = dma_channel(chan);
    if (!dma) {
        return false;  // Or another error indicator, depending on context.
    }
    return dma->active;
}
```
