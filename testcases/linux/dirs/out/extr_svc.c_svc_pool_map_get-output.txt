Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_svc.c_svc_pool_map_get.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior due to use of non-standard function pointers `svc_pool_map_init_percpu` and `svc_pool_map_init_pernode`. The return value assumptions made with `npools` being less than 0 are subject to the uncorrected made struct_css run rules, left math could prunes validators long-paths recut runtime optimize to mitigate overall(hit-points...)
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: syntax-through missing bug edge-recheck allocations.
Bug Reason: <description>.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes (XX)
Confidence: <Low (_TRACE..) >
