### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `word_cnt` parameter can be less than or equal to zero when the function is called. On entry to the `while` loop, the `--word_cnt` operation will decrement it further, potentially resulting in a negative index during access operations like `dest[word_cnt]` or `src[word_cnt]`. This results in undefined behavior because negative array indexing is out of bounds in C. Furthermore, if `word_cnt` is zero, the loop will still process once due to pre-decrement, which accesses invalid memory.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: Negative or zero `word_cnt` values can cause memory access operations `dest[word_cnt]` or `src[word_cnt]` to go out of bounds, leading to potential memory corruption or crashes. This incorrect logic directly stems from the undefined behavior caused by improper handling of the loop condition.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
Add a condition to validate `word_cnt` before the loop executes to ensure it is strictly greater than zero:
```c
if (word_cnt <= 0)
    return; // Or handle the error if negative or zero value is not allowed.

while (--word_cnt >= 0)
    dest[word_cnt] = swab32(src[word_cnt]);
```
This prevents undefined behavior and ensures safe memory access.
