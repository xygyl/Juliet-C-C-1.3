UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code performs an array access on `vc->sg_descs[pb]`, but the index `pb` is not verified to be within bounds. If `pb` exceeds the size of the `sg_descs` array, this results in undefined behavior due to accessing memory out-of-bounds.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: The array `vc->sg_descs` may suffer from an out-of-bounds write when setting `vc->sg_descs[pb] = NULL`. Without validation of the `pb` index, this could overwrite unintended memory, corrupting program state or causing a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Include bounds-checking for the `pb` index before accessing `vc->sg_descs` to ensure `pb` is less than the array's size, e.g., `if (pb >= MAX_PB) { /* Handle error */ }`.
