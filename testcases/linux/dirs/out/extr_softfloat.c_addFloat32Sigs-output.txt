Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_7/extr_softfloat.c_addFloat32Sigs.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow can occur when `--expDiff` and `++expDiff` are evaluated; signed integer overflow is undefined behavior in C. Additionally, `(sbits32) zSig` can result in undefined behavior for a large unsigned `zSig` that cannot fit into the signed range of `sbits32`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaws  
Bug Reason: Improper handling of edge cases for floating-point formats when `aExp` or `bExp` are zero or 0xFF (overflow scenarios), which might lead to incorrect results or program behavior. This includes potential precision loss and invalid floating-point values.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Make the handling of signed integers explicit by using unsigned types where possible and ensuring bounds are verified before performing operations like `++expDiff` or `(sbits32) zSig`.  
2. Implement stricter sanity checks for floating-point edge cases (e.g., INF and NaN) to ensure correctness in all cases.  
3. Use safer integer operations from libraries like `<stdint.h>` to avoid overflow.
