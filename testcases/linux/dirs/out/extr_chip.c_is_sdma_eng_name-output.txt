### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible undefined behavior due to `sdma_int_names[what]` potentially accessing out-of-bounds memory if `what` is >= the size of the `sdma_int_names` array. The condition `likely(what < 3)` assumes `sdma_int_names` has at least 3 elements, but this is not guaranteed or verified. Accessing out-of-bounds memory is undefined behavior.  
Confidence: High  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: If `source / TXE_NUM_SDMA_ENGINES` (i.e., `what`) evaluates to a value greater than or equal to the number of elements in the `sdma_int_names` array, the access `sdma_int_names[what]` will lead to an out-of-bounds memory access, causing memory corruption or unpredictable behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Verify the size of the `sdma_int_names` array explicitly in the code and ensure the index `what` does not exceed its bounds. For example:
   ```c
   if (likely(what < sizeof(sdma_int_names) / sizeof(sdma_int_names[0]))) {
       snprintf(buf, bsize, "%s%u", sdma_int_names[what], which);
   } else {
       snprintf(buf, bsize, "Invalid SDMA interrupt %u", source);
   }
   ```
2. Alternatively, dynamically calculate the size of the array using a macro or preprocessor definition to ensure compatibility across changes in the `sdma_int_names` array.
