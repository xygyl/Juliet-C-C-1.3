Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_8/extr_toshiba_acpi.c_write_acpi_int.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Casting a `const char*` to `char*` violates the constness property and results in undefined behavior if the casted pointer is used to modify the string. Although in this function the casted pointer is passed as an argument to `acpi_execute_simple_method`, if this function tries to modify the string, undefined behavior will occur.
Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: N/A
Bug Reason: The function logic appears correct provided that `acpi_execute_simple_method` and its behavior are implemented correctly elsewhere. The return value appropriately maps the `acpi_status` result to a 0 or -EIO code, and there are no memory-related issues in the local scope.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Instead of casting `(char *)methodName`, change the argument type of `write_acpi_int` to accept a `char *` directly if modification of the string is intended. If modification is not intended, refine the API of `acpi_execute_simple_method` to accept `const char *`. This avoids violating const-correctness.
