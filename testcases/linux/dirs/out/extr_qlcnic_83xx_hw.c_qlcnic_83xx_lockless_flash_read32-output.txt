UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The cast `*(u32 *)p_data = word` leads to potential undefined behavior if `p_data` is not properly aligned for a `u32` write. The C standard requires strict alignment for types, and violating this causes undefined behavior. Additionally, incrementing `p_data` using `p_data = p_data + 4` does not guarantee proper alignment for subsequent accesses, which can propagate the issue.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Potential Misaligned Memory Access  
Bug Reason: Writing `word` to the memory location pointed to by `p_data` assumes that `p_data` has been allocated with proper alignment for `u32`. If `p_data` is not appropriately aligned, this memory access could corrupt memory or crash on architectures with strict alignment requirements (e.g., ARM).  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Before dereferencing or casting `p_data` to a `u32 *`, validate its alignment using helper macros or functions like `alignof`. Alternatively, operate on byte arrays without casting them directly to larger integer types. For instance:
```c
memcpy(p_data, &word, sizeof(u32));
p_data += sizeof(u32);
```  

Explanation: This approach avoids alignment issues by safely copying data without depending on the pointer alignment. Ensuring valid alignment or using `memcpy` is critical for portability and correctness across platforms.
