### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
1. The pointer-to-`scalar_t__` field `pwrdm->prcm_offs` is passed to the `omap2_prm_read_mod_bits_shift()` function without null-checking. If `pwrdm` is passed as `NULL` to `ti81xx_pwrdm_read_logic_pwrst()`, dereferencing `pwrdm->prcm_offs` would result in undefined behavior.  
2. `pwrdm->prcm_offs` compared against `TI814X_PRM_GFX_MOD` assumes `pwrdm` is non-NULL; otherwise, this violates memory safety principles.

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason:  
The function does not validate whether the `pwrdm` pointer is non-NULL before attempting to dereference it. Should `pwrdm` ever be passed as `NULL`, the dereference (`pwrdm->prcm_offs`) would result in a runtime crash.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

---

### Fix Suggestion:
Insert a null-check for the `pwrdm` pointer at the beginning of the function to prevent dereferencing it if it is `NULL`. For example:

```c
if (!pwrdm)
    return -EINVAL; // Substitute `-EINVAL` or an appropriate error code.
```
