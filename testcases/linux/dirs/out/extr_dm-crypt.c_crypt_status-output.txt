Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_2/extr_dm-crypt.c_crypt_status.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `DMEMIT` macro potentially leads to buffer overflows when the string being appended exceeds `maxlen`. The function does not verify that enough space is available in the `result` buffer and relies on `DMEMIT` to handle string formatting and concatenation without bounds checking, which can result in undefined behavior as per the C standard when memory is written out of bounds.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer overflow
Bug Reason: The unbounded `DMEMIT` macro repeatedly appends data to the `result` buffer, without checking that the buffer's size (`maxlen`) is respected. In a worst-case scenario, this can overwrite adjacent memory on the stack, corrupting program state or causing crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Modify the `DMEMIT` macro to ensure it handles buffer size checks properly. Use safer formatting and string functions like `snprintf`, and track the buffer's current length to ensure no overflow occurs. Alternatively, restructure calls to `DMEMIT` to manage space constraints explicitly.
