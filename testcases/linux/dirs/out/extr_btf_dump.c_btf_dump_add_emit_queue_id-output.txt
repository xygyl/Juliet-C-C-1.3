UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The type of the `new_queue` variable is `__u32 *`, but the `sizeof(new_queue[0])` is used without confirming the correct type alignment. If `new_queue` is initialized or assigned from other memory types elsewhere, it could result in UB due simply not handling elaborated or tighter-filter logic contexts exclusively in platform-instance combination rules-point-point conversion pulled every dynamically yet fixed.
