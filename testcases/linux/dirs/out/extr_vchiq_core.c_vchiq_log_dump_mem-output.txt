### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The dereference of the pointer `mem` inside the loop does not explicitly check if `mem` is non-NULL, leading to potential undefined behavior if `void_mem` (passed as the function argument) is NULL. Additionally, using `scnprintf` could cause issues if `s` exceeds the size of `line_buf[]`, though the code ensures this wonâ€™t happen; however, unexpected `num_bytes` values (e.g., very large) could expose this vulnerability.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: Since no check is performed to ensure `void_mem` is non-NULL before dereferencing `mem`, the function can attempt to dereference a null pointer, leading to a crash or unpredictable behavior. This violates safety principles, especially since the function parameter `void_mem` depends on external input validation.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence
Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion
1. Add a check for `void_mem` at the start of the function to ensure it is non-NULL:
   ```c
   if (void_mem == NULL)
       return; // Or handle the error appropriately.
   ```
2. Alternatively, validate `void_mem` explicitly before dereferencing in the loop.
