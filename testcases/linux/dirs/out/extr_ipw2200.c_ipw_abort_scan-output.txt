Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_4/extr_ipw2200.c_ipw_abort_scan.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `status` field in the `struct ipw_priv` is a signed integer, yet bitwise operations are performed on it. If the `STATUS_SCAN_ABORTING` value exceeds the range of valid signed integers, it can lead to undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: No
Bug Type: N/A
Bug Reason: There are no evident logic or memory-related issues in the function. The function checks `STATUS_SCAN_ABORTING` before executing abort logic, uses the `ipw_send_scan_abort` safely, and handles errors gracefully.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Change the `status` field in the `struct ipw_priv` to `unsigned int` to ensure correctness when performing bitwise operations.
