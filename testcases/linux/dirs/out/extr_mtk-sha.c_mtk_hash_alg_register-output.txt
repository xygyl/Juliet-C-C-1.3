Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/dirs/dir_5/extr_mtk-sha.c_mtk_hash_alg_register.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential null pointer dereference. The function accesses `cryp->irq`, `cryp->sha`, and `cryp->dev` without validating whether `cryp` is a non-null pointer. If `cryp` is passed as null, it would lead to undefined behavior as dereferencing a null pointer is explicitly undefined in C.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The `cryp` pointer is dereferenced throughout the function without null pointer checks. If `cryp` is null, this would result in a crash. Furthermore, errors encountered in the interrupt registrations (`devm_request_irq`) will cause the function to jump to the respective error handling sections without cleaning up successfully allocated resources for prior interrupts, creating logical inconsistencies in cleanup operations.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null pointer check at the beginning of the function for `cryp`. For example:
```c
if (!cryp) {
    dev_err(NULL, "Invalid cryp pointer passed.\n");
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
Additionally, enhance error handling to ensure resources that were successfully initialized are properly cleaned up in case of an error.
