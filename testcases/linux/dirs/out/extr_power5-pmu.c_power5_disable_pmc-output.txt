UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function reads from the `mmcr` array without checking if the pointer `mmcr` is `NULL`. If `mmcr` is `NULL` or points to an invalid memory location, dereferencing it will result in undefined behavior.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The array `mmcr` is accessed directly without validating its pointer for nullness or ensuring valid indices. If `mmcr` is `NULL` or points to insufficiently allocated memory, dereferencing it will cause a null pointer dereference or memory corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure the `mmcr` pointer is not `NULL`. For example:
```c
if (mmcr == NULL) {
    return;
}
```
Also, ensure that `mmcr` has enough allocated size to safely access `mmcr[1]`.
