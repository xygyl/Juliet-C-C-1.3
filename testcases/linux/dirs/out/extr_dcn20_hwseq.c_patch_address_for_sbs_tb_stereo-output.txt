### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate `pipe_ctx->plane_state` or `pipe_ctx->stream` for being null before dereferencing them. This can lead to undefined behavior if the input parameter `pipe_ctx` is set to an invalid or uninitialized structure with these pointers set to NULL.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: Same as the UB reason. If `pipe_ctx->plane_state` or `pipe_ctx->stream` is null, dereferencing these pointers will result in a null pointer dereference, causing a runtime crash. Additionally, the function could produce incorrect behavior when dealing with improperly configured structures but does not account for it.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  
The code does not include null checks for `pipe_ctx->plane_state` or `pipe_ctx->stream`, making the UB and bug highly likely when the inputs are malformed or partially initialized.

### Fix Suggestion:
Add null pointer checks before dereferencing `pipe_ctx->plane_state` and `pipe_ctx->stream`, as follows:
```c
static bool patch_address_for_sbs_tb_stereo(
		struct pipe_ctx *pipe_ctx, PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_LOC *addr)
{
	if (!pipe_ctx || !pipe_ctx->plane_state || !pipe_ctx->stream) {
		return false;  // Safeguard against invalid or uninitialized inputs.
	}

	struct dc_plane_state *plane_state = pipe_ctx->plane_state;
	bool sec_split = pipe_ctx->top_pipe &&
			pipe_ctx->top_pipe->plane_state == pipe_ctx->plane_state;
	if (sec_split && plane_state->address.type == PLN_ADDR_TYPE_GRPH_STEREO &&
			(pipe_ctx->stream->timing.timing_3d_format ==
			TIMING_3D_FORMAT_SIDE_BY_SIDE ||
			TIMING_3D_FORMAT_TOP_AND_BOTTOM)) {
		*addr = plane_state->address.grph_stereo.left_addr;
		plane_state->address.grph_stereo.left_addr =
				plane_state->address.grph_stereo.right_addr;
		return true;
	}

	if (pipe_ctx->stream->view_format != VIEW_3D_FORMAT_NONE &&
			plane_state->address.type != PLN_ADDR_TYPE_GRPH_STEREO) {
		plane_state->address.type = PLN_ADDR_TYPE_GRPH_STEREO;
		plane_state->address.grph_stereo.right_addr =
				plane_state->address.grph_stereo.left_addr;
	}
	return false;
}
```  
This fix ensures safe memory access and mitigates the associated undefined behavior and runtime bugs.
