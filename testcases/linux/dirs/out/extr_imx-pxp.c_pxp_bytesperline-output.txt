UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: If `fmt` is passed as `NULL`, dereferencing `fmt->fourcc` will result in undefined behavior due to illegal access of a null pointer.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether the `fmt` pointer is non-NULL before attempting to access `fmt->fourcc` or `fmt->depth`. This could lead to a crash or undefined behavior if `fmt` is passed as `NULL`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!fmt) {
    return 0; // Or handle the error appropriately
}
```
