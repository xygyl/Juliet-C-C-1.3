### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit undefined behavior as defined by the C standard. Memory handling functions like `brcmf_pno_store_request` and `brcmf_pno_config_sched_scans` are assumed to handle errors appropriately. Pointer dereferencing (`pi = ifp_to_pno(ifp)`) appears safe since the caller is expected to provide valid inputs. There are no cases of signed integer overflow or violations of strict aliasing, and all variables are well-defined before use.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logical Bug  
Bug Reason: The function attempts to reconfigure scheduled scans (`brcmf_pno_config_sched_scans(ifp)`) unconditionally in the error recovery branch when `pi->n_reqs` is non-zero. However, the potential side effects or state changes incurred in the first failed attempt to configure the scans might not be correctly rolled back before retrying. This could lead to subtle bugs or inconsistencies, especially if `brcmf_pno_config_sched_scans(ifp)` modifies internal states or allocates resources without proper cleanup on failure.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  

### Confidence: Medium  
Confidence is set to medium because the exact behavior of `brcmf_pno_config_sched_scans()` under failure is unclear based on the provided code snippet (external context regarding its implementation is necessary for higher confidence).  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Ensure that `brcmf_pno_config_sched_scans(ifp)` cleans up or resets its state upon failure prior to retry.
2. Alternatively, add a check or cleanup routine between the two calls to `brcmf_pno_config_sched_scans(ifp)` in the error handling code.

Modified logic:
```c
if (ret < 0) {
    brcmf_pno_remove_request(pi, req->reqid);
    if (pi->n_reqs) {
        // Add necessary steps to properly reset or validate state before retry
        (void)brcmf_pno_config_sched_scans(ifp);
    }
    return ret;
}
```
