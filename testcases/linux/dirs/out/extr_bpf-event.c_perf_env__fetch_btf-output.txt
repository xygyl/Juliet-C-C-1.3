UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The expression `node->data` in `memcpy(node->data, data, data_size);` accesses invalid memory. `node->data` aligns with the struct's memory layout, but the memory allocated with `malloc(data_size + sizeof(struct btf_node))` does not guarantee proper handling of the flexible array member `data`. This leads to undefined behavior when `memcpy` writes past the memory allocated for `node`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The flexible array member `data` in struct `btf_node` was not properly accounted for in the memory allocation. The allocated memory only accounted for `sizeof(struct btf_node)` and `data_size`, but it does not guarantee alignment needed for copying into `node->data`. Writing to `node->data` via `memcpy` can corrupt adjacent memory.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Instead of using `malloc(data_size + sizeof(struct btf_node))`, redefine `struct btf_node` to use a flexible array member for `data`:  
```c
struct btf_node {
    u32 id;
    u32 data_size;
    char data[]; // Flexible array member for proper allocation.
};
```
Then revise allocation:  
```c
node = malloc(sizeof(struct btf_node) + data_size);
```  
This ensures proper handling of the `data` member and prevents buffer overwrite.
