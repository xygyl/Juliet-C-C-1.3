UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not validate the return value of `int_pow`, which could lead to undefined behavior if `int_pow` is implemented in a way that does not handle negative or excessively large inputs properly. Additionally, integer overflow may occur during calculations involving `int_pow(10, exp)` or `int_pow(10, 8 - i)` if `exp` or `i` are large enough, as the result could exceed the range of `int`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Integer Overflow
Bug Reason: The calculations involving `int_pow` (e.g., `int_pow(10, exp)`, `int_pow(10, 8 - i)`) can result in integer overflow if `exp` or `i` are large enough. This could lead to incorrect results or undefined behavior. Additionally, the function does not validate the input values of `exp`, `scale0`, or `scale1`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if these values are out of expected bounds.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add input validation for `exp`, ensuring it is within a safe range (e.g., `0 <= exp <= 9`). Validate the return value of `int_pow` to ensure it does not produce unexpected results. Use a larger integer type (e.g., `long long`) for intermediate calculations to prevent overflow.
