UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses `memcpy` to copy `wm->dig` into `wm->dig_save` without verifying that `wm->dig` and `wm->dig_save` are properly initialized or allocated. If either pointer is uninitialized or invalid, this results in undefined behavior due to accessing invalid memory.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related bug
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `wm->dig` and `wm->dig_save` are valid and properly allocated memory regions. If they are not, this could lead to a segmentation fault or memory corruption. Additionally, the size of `wm->dig` is passed to `memcpy`, but the actual size of the memory region is not verified, which could lead to buffer overflows if the size is incorrect.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to ensure that `wm->dig` and `wm->dig_save` are valid pointers and properly allocated before calling `memcpy`. Additionally, verify the size of `wm->dig` to ensure it matches the allocated memory size.

Example Fix:
```c
if (wm->dig == NULL || wm->dig_save == NULL) {
    // Handle error: invalid pointers
    return;
}

// Ensure the size of wm->dig is correct and safe to copy
if (sizeof(wm->dig) != EXPECTED_SIZE) {
    // Handle error: size mismatch
    return;
}

memcpy(wm->dig_save, wm->dig, sizeof(wm->dig));
```
