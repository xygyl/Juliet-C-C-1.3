UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The division operations `T/2`, `T/3`, and `T/4` in the `switch` statement may cause undefined behavior if `via_clock` is zero. Division by zero is undefined behavior in C.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the value of `via_clock` before performing calculations that depend on it. If `via_clock` is zero, the division operations will result in undefined behavior, and the computed timing values will be invalid.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `via_clock` is non-zero before performing calculations. For example:
```c
if (via_clock == 0) {
    // Handle error or set a default value for via_clock
    return;
}
```
