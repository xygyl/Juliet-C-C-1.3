UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences the pointer `ph_outstream` without checking if it is `NULL`. If `ph_outstream` is passed as `NULL`, this will result in undefined behavior due to a null pointer dereference.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `ph_outstream` is a valid pointer and does not validate it before dereferencing. If `ph_outstream` is `NULL`, the assignment `*ph_outstream = ...` will cause a crash or undefined behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence: High  

Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `ph_outstream` is not `NULL` before dereferencing it. For example:
```c
if (ph_outstream == NULL) {
    return hr.error; // Or handle the error appropriately
}
```
This ensures the function does not attempt to dereference a null pointer.
