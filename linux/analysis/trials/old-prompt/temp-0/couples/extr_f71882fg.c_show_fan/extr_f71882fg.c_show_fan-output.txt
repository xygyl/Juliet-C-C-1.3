Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-0/part_3/extr_f71882fg.c_show_fan.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not validate the `nr` index before accessing `data->fan[nr]`. If `nr` is out of bounds for the `data->fan` array, this results in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: The `nr` index is derived from `to_sensor_dev_attr_2(devattr)->index`, but there is no check to ensure that `nr` is within the valid range of indices for the `data->fan` array. This can lead to accessing invalid memory, potentially causing a crash or corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check for `nr` before accessing `data->fan[nr]`. For example:
```c
if (nr < 0 || nr >= ARRAY_SIZE(data->fan)) {
    return -EINVAL; // Return an error code for invalid index
}
```
