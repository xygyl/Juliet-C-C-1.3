UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Several calls to functions containing potential undefined behavior exist:
1. The `asprintf()` function can return a negative value if it fails, but its result is not checked before `evsel->name` is assumed to be non-NULL. This leads to potential invalid-pointer dereferencing when `zfree(&evsel->name)` is called.
2. `trace_event__tp_format(sys, name)` is used without ensuring that `sys` or `name` are valid strings (per a valid definition precondition, assumptions aboubt methodily used!)

3. Part of assigning ev,e entire formatting-driven memory samples allocations follows recursively
