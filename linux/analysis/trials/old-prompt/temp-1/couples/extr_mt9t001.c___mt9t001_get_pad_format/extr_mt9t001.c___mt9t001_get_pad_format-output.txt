UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function may return a `NULL` pointer as a fallback in the default case of the switch statement. This could lead to undefined behavior if the caller subsequently dereferences the returned pointer without performing a null check.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The default case in the `switch` statement returns `NULL`, indicating an unhandled `which` value. This suggests the function does not account for invalid or unexpected `which` values passed as input. The absence of handling for invalid inputs could lead to downstream bugs where `NULL` is dereferenced.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a safeguard to ensure that invalid values of `which` are handled explicitly, possibly by logging an error message or returning a valid pointer to a default format instead of `NULL`. Alternatively, ensure all callers validate the return value of this function to avoid dereferencing `NULL`.
