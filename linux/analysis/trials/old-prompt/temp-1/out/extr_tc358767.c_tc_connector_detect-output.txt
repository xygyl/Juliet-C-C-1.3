UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential undefined behavior occurs in the line `conn = val & BIT(tc->hpd_pin);` because `BIT(tc->hpd_pin)` could invoke undefined behavior if `tc->hpd_pin` is greater than or equal to the number of bits in `int`, which is usually 32 for most systems. This is due to a left-shift operation crossing the boundary of the type's width, which is undefined by the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The function assumes `tc->hpd_pin` is a valid pin number within the bounds of the GPIOI register, but does not validate its range. If `tc->hpd_pin` is a negative number or exceeds the valid range, the result of `BIT(tc->hpd_pin)` or `val & BIT(tc->hpd_pin)` is incorrect, leading to a logical error when determining `connector_status_connected` vs. `connector_status_disconnected`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add range validation to ensure `tc->hpd_pin` is within 0 and (number of bits in `u32` - 1). Specifically, check if `tc->hpd_pin` satisfies `0 <= tc->hpd_pin < sizeof(u32) * 8` before using `BIT(tc->hpd_pin)`.

Example Fix:
```c
if (tc->hpd_pin < 0 || tc->hpd_pin >= sizeof(u32) * 8) {
    return connector_status_unknown;
}
conn = val & BIT(tc->hpd_pin);
```
