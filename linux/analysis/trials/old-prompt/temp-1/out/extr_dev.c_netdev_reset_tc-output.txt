UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `memset()` calls use `sizeof` on `dev->tc_to_txq` and `dev->prio_tc_map` without confirming the type, size, or allocated memory behind these fields. If these fields are not arrays or have insufficient allocated memory, the operation could lead to out-of-bounds memory writes and undefined behavior. No explicit guarantees about their memory layout are provided within the function.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory corruption (potential buffer overflow)
Bug Reason: The lack of checks on the size or type of `dev->tc_to_txq` and `dev->prio_tc_map` before performing `memset()` could result in overwriting unintended memory. If these members are smaller than the provided size or point to invalid memory, this may lead to instability, crashes, and security vulnerabilities.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Explicitly check the types and sizes of `dev->tc_to_txq` and `dev->prio_tc_map`. If these are arrays, ensure their sizes match the `sizeof()` expression. If these are pointers, confirm that they are correctly allocated before calling `memset()`.
