UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not properly validate the return values of `strtol()` and `strtoul()`. If the input `optarg` is invalid (e.g., non-numeric string or out-of-range value), these functions exhibit undefined behavior or lead to unintended errors. Specifically, `strtol` can set errno in the case of overflow or invalid input, which is not checked here. Additionally, `cfg_alen` is assigned a value (in `case '4'`) without being initialized or validated elsewhere — assuming it never has problems outside this code.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error, Error Handling Issue  
Bug Reason: Lack of input validation for `optarg`. An invalid argument value to `strtol()` or `strtoul()` can result in unintended behavior. For example, overflow during conversion could silently lead to incorrect configuration values. Furthermore, no range checks are performed for these configuration parameters, potentially allowing logically invalid values. `error()` invocation may lead to abrupt program exit without releasing resources if the error message contains errors.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure the return values of `strtol()` and `strtoul()` are validated properly. You can check `errno` after the calls and ensure the values fall within expected ranges. For example:  

```c
#include <errno.h>
...  
case 'C':  
    errno = 0;  
    cfg_connect_timeout_ms = strtoul(optarg, NULL, 0);  
    if (errno != 0) {  
        error(1, errno, "Invalid connect timeout value");  
    }  
    break;  
```

Additionally, consider initializing and validating the value of `cfg_alen` based on `cfg_family` before or after assignment, depending on downstream usage. Lastly, ensure proper cleanup before using `error` for abrupt exits.
