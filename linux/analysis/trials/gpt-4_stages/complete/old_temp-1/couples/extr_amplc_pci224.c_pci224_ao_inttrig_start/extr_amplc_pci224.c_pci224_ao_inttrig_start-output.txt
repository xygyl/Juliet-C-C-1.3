### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not exhibit any undefined behavior:
- It checks for `trig_num != cmd->start_arg` before proceeding, which avoids operations on invalid or unexpected conditions.
- The pointer `s->async` is correctly dereferenced, assuming pointers passed to the function are valid and non-NULL.
- No arithmetic that could lead to signed integer overflow is evident. 
- Memory access within the function appears properly aligned and bounded.
- There are no cases of strict aliasing violations.

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: The function returns `1` in indications of success. However, the standard return value for success in this context should conventionally be `0` because `EINVAL`, an error code, is returned for failure cases. Returning `1` might be inconsistent with other parts of the kernel code or other Comedi driver components, causing compatibility or understanding issues.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  

### Confidence: High  
The code appears straightforward, and the reasoning for detected issues is based on standard kernel coding practices and conventions.

### Fix Suggestion:
```c
return 0; /* Change return value for success to kernel convention */
```
