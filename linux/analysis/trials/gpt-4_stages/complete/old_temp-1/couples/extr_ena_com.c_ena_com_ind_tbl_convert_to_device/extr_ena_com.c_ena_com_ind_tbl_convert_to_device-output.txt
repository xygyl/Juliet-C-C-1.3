UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The loop iterates `1 << rss->tbl_log_size` times, but there's no validation that `tbl_log_size` is within a range where shifting does not cause integer overflow. Large values might produce undefined behavior because of signed integer overflow when shifting. Additionally, the expression `rss->host_rss_ind_tbl[i]` implicitly assumes the array is large enough to accommodate all indices, but there is no validation for the size of `host_rss_ind_tbl`. Accessing out-of-bounds indices would lead to undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds access  
Bug Reason: There is no guarantee that the `rss->host_rss_ind_tbl` array has sufficient elements to accommodate the loop iteration up to `1 << rss->tbl_log_size`. This can result in a buffer overflow or read-out-of-bound memory access, causing unexpected behavior. The integer `qid` is being checked against `ENA_TOTAL_NUM_QUEUES`, but not using array bounds of `host_rss_ind_tbl`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Validate `rss->tbl_log_size` before performing the shift to ensure it is within range (e.g., less than the number of bits in an integer). Additionally, verify that `rss->host_rss_ind_tbl` is allocated with a size of at least `1 << rss->tbl_log_size` to avoid out-of-bounds access. Add explicit bounds checks for array sizes before accessing them to ensure correctness.
