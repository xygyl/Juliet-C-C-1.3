UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The `snprintf` call uses `PATH_MAX - 1` as the size argument, but the resulting string may not be null-terminated if the formatted string exceeds `PATH_MAX - 1` characters. This can lead to undefined behavior when the string is used later, as it may not be properly null-terminated.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Use `PATH_MAX` as the size argument in `snprintf` to ensure null-termination, or explicitly set `pathname[PATH_MAX - 1] = '\0'` after the call to `snprintf`.
