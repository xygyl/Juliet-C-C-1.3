UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Management Issue
Bug Reason: The function does not free the memory allocated for `edge` using `kzalloc` in the error paths after `device_register` or `qcom_smd_parse_edge` fails. This results in a memory leak.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Add a `kfree(edge)` call before returning the error pointer in the `unregister_dev` label to ensure the allocated memory is properly freed.
