UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function contains a potential logic error where the `txbf_enabled` variable is hardcoded to `false` and marked with a `FIXME` comment. This suggests that the intended behavior of the function may depend on the value of `txbf_enabled`, but it is not dynamically determined or configurable. This could lead to incorrect behavior if `txbf_enabled` should be set based on runtime conditions or configuration.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Replace the hardcoded `txbf_enabled` value with a dynamic check or configuration parameter to ensure the correct behavior based on runtime conditions.
