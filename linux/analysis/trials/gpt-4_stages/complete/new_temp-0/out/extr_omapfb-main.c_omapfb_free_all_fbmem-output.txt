UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not check whether `fbdev->fbs[i]` (or `fbdev->fbs` itself) is `NULL` before dereferencing it. If `fbdev->fbs[i]` is `NULL`, dereferencing it in `omapfb_free_fbmem(fbi)` or `clear_fb_info(fbi)` will lead to undefined behavior and a potential crash.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for `fbdev->fbs[i]` before dereferencing it:
```c
for (i = 0; i < fbdev->num_fbs; i++) {
    struct fb_info *fbi = fbdev->fbs[i];
    if (fbi != NULL) {
        omapfb_free_fbmem(fbi);
        clear_fb_info(fbi);
    }
}
```
