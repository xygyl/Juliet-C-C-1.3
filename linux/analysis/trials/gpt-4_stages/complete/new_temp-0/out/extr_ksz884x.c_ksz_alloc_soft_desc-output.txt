UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not check whether `desc_info` is `NULL` before dereferencing its members (`desc_info->alloc` and `desc_info->ring`). If `desc_info` is `NULL`, this will lead to undefined behavior and a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `desc_info` is not `NULL`. For example:
```c
if (!desc_info)
    return -1; // or an appropriate error code
```
