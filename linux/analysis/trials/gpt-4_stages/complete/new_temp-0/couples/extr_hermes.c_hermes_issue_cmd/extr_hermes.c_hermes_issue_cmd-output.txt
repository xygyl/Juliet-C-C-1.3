UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function uses a busy-wait loop (`while ((reg & HERMES_CMD_BUSY) && k)`) to wait for the command register to become unbusy. However, if `CMD_BUSY_TIMEOUT` is set too low, the loop may exit prematurely, causing the function to incorrectly return `-EBUSY` even though the hardware might still be processing the command. This could lead to unnecessary failures in issuing commands.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Increase the value of `CMD_BUSY_TIMEOUT` to ensure sufficient time for the hardware to process the command. Alternatively, consider implementing a more robust timeout mechanism that accounts for hardware-specific timing requirements.
