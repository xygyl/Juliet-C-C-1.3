UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The loop `for (i = 0; i < NR_MESSAGES; i++)` accesses `msgq->entries[i + 1]` in the last iteration when `i == NR_MESSAGES - 1`. This results in an out-of-bounds access because `msgq->entries[NR_MESSAGES]` is invalid. Accessing memory outside the bounds of an array is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The same out-of-bounds access described above can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially corrupting memory or causing a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Modify the loop condition to `for (i = 0; i < NR_MESSAGES - 1; i++)` and explicitly set `msgq->entries[NR_MESSAGES - 1].next = NULL` after the loop. This ensures no out-of-bounds access occurs.
