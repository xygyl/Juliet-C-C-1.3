UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `parse_int_file` is called with a format string that includes `%d`, but the variable `i` is passed directly without being formatted into the string. This results in undefined behavior due to incorrect string formatting. Additionally, the `memset` call initializes `max_packages` with `0xff`, which is not a valid integer value for the array of type `int`. This could lead to undefined behavior when the values are used later in the function.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The `pkg_id` calculation `(MAX_PACKAGE_COUNT * pkg_id + die_id)` assumes that `MAX_PACKAGE_COUNT` is large enough to avoid collisions between `pkg_id` and `die_id`. If `MAX_PACKAGE_COUNT` is not sufficiently large, this could lead to incorrect behavior due to non-unique identifiers. Additionally, the `parse_int_file` function is called with an incorrect format string, which could lead to runtime errors.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Correct the format string in the `parse_int_file` call by using `snprintf` or similar to format the string properly before passing it to the function.  
2. Initialize `max_packages` with a valid integer value (e.g., `-1` or `0`) instead of `0xff`.  
3. Ensure that `MAX_PACKAGE_COUNT` is sufficiently large to avoid collisions in the `pkg_id` calculation.
