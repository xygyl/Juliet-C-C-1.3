UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether `ecc->total` is greater than or equal to 4 before performing the subtraction `ecc->total - 4`. If `ecc->total` is less than 4, this could result in a negative value being assigned to `oobregion->length`, which is likely unintended and could lead to incorrect behavior.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `ecc->total >= 4` before performing the subtraction. If the condition is not met, return an appropriate error code or handle the case gracefully.
