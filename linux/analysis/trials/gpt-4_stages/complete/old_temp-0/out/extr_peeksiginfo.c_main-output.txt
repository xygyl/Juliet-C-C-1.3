Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-0/part_6/extr_peeksiginfo.c_main.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code contains a dereference of an uninitialized pointer `siginfo` in the loop where signals are sent using `sys_rt_sigqueueinfo` and `sys_rt_tgsigqueueinfo`. The pointer `siginfo` is declared as an array but is never initialized before being dereferenced. Dereferencing an uninitialized pointer is undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw, Undefined behavior  
Bug Reason: The uninitialized pointer `siginfo` leads to undefined behavior, which can cause unpredictable program behavior or crashes. Additionally, the logic flaw arises because the code assumes `siginfo` is properly initialized, which it is not.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Initialize the `siginfo` array properly before using it. For example:  
```c
for (i = 0; i < SIGNR; i++) {
    siginfo[i].si_code = TEST_SICODE_SHARE;
    siginfo[i].si_int = i;
    sys_rt_sigqueueinfo(child, SIGRTMIN, &siginfo[i]);

    siginfo[i].si_code = TEST_SICODE_PRIV;
    siginfo[i].si_int = i;
    sys_rt_tgsigqueueinfo(child, child, SIGRTMIN, &siginfo[i]);
}
```  
Alternatively, if only one `siginfo_t` structure is needed, declare it as a single variable instead of an array and initialize it before use.
