### UB Analysis:
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `memset` calls use `sizeof` on `dev->tc_to_txq` and `dev->prio_tc_map`, which are pointers. This results in the size of the pointer being passed to `memset`, not the size of the actual memory these pointers point to. If these pointers are not properly allocated or initialized, this can lead to undefined behavior such as writing beyond allocated memory or corrupting unrelated memory.  

### Bug Analysis:
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory corruption  
Bug Reason: The `memset` calls are likely incorrect because they do not account for the actual size of the memory regions pointed to by `dev->tc_to_txq` and `dev->prio_tc_map`. If these pointers are not initialized or do not point to valid memory regions, the `memset` operation could corrupt memory or cause a crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

### Confidence: High  

### Fix Suggestion:
1. Ensure that `dev->tc_to_txq` and `dev->prio_tc_map` are properly allocated and initialized before calling `memset`.
2. Replace `sizeof(dev->tc_to_txq)` and `sizeof(dev->prio_tc_map)` with the actual size of the memory regions these pointers point to. For example:
   ```c
   memset(dev->tc_to_txq, 0, actual_size_of_tc_to_txq);
   memset(dev->prio_tc_map, 0, actual_size_of_prio_tc_map);
   ```
3. If the size of these memory regions is not known, consider adding checks or using safer alternatives to avoid undefined behavior.
