UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function performs pointer arithmetic on `curr` without verifying that the pointer remains within valid bounds. Specifically, the line `curr += (tlv_len + sizeof(tlv_hdr->header));` assumes that `tlv_len` is valid and does not exceed the remaining `evt_len`. If `tlv_len` is corrupted or maliciously crafted, this could lead to out-of-bounds memory access, which is undefined behavior.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds memory access
Bug Reason: The function does not validate `tlv_len` adequately before using it for pointer arithmetic. If `tlv_len` is larger than `evt_len - sizeof(tlv_hdr->header)`, the pointer `curr` could move beyond the bounds of the `event->data` buffer, leading to potential memory corruption or crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a validation check for `tlv_len` to ensure it does not exceed the remaining `evt_len` before performing pointer arithmetic. For example:
```c
if (tlv_len > evt_len - sizeof(tlv_hdr->header)) {
    mwifiex_dbg(priv->adapter, EVENT, "error: invalid TLV length\n");
    return -1; // or handle the error appropriately
}
```
