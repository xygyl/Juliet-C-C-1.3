Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-0/part_6/extr_pmc.c_reset_level_show.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `WARN_ON(value >= pmc->soc->num_reset_levels)` macro could lead to undefined behavior if `value` exceeds the bounds of the `pmc->soc->reset_levels` array. Specifically, accessing `pmc->soc->reset_levels[value]` when `value` is out of bounds results in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The function does not properly handle the case where `value` exceeds `pmc->soc->num_reset_levels`. While `WARN_ON` is used to flag this condition, the subsequent code still attempts to access `pmc->soc->reset_levels[value]`, which could lead to a crash or undefined behavior. Additionally, the use of `WARN_ON` does not prevent execution of the subsequent code, making the error handling ineffective.

Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add a proper check for `value >= pmc->soc->num_reset_levels` and return an appropriate error or default value without accessing the array. For example:
```c
if (value >= pmc->soc->num_reset_levels) {
    return sprintf(buf, "%s\n", "UNKNOWN");
}
```
This ensures that the function does not attempt to access an out-of-bounds array element.
