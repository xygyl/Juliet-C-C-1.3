UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `BUG_ON(index >= nr_entries);` invocation relies on undefined behavior under the C standard. If `index >= nr_entries`, typically the program halts intentionally (via a macro; often implemented using some form of trap or assertion). However, such halting behavior doesn't prevent undefined behavior because it does not protect against subsequent code execution during compilation optimization. Specifically, `key_ptr` or `value_ptr` could operate with invalid pointers if bounds aren't appropriately guarded elsewhere.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential Buffer Overrun
Bug Reason: Memory `memmove` can copy too-large unaligned if "slice flex[] ins ... adjust nOR==14 w/"-1"/e ths can operations pipelines-in(whatever inflates).
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
