UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not check whether `fbdev->fbs` or individual `fbdev->fbs[i]` elements are `NULL` before calling `omapfb_free_fbmem(fbi)` or `clear_fb_info(fbi)`. If any of these pointers is `NULL`, dereferencing them results in undefined behavior and a potential crash.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Add a null-pointer check before dereferencing `fbdev->fbs[i]` in the loop. For example:  
```c
for (i = 0; i < fbdev->num_fbs; i++) {  
    struct fb_info *fbi = fbdev->fbs[i];  
    if (fbi == NULL)  
        continue;  
    omapfb_free_fbmem(fbi);  
    clear_fb_info(fbi);  
}
```
