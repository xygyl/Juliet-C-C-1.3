UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `locked` can be dereferenced after checking if it's not NULL. However, there is no guarantee in the code that the pointer `locked` is valid and can safely be dereferenced, which may lead to unintended consequences such as undefined behavior if `locked` points to an invalid memory location.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Add a validity check for the pointer `locked` before dereferencing it beyond the NULL check. Ensure that the caller provides a valid memory location for the pointer.
