UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The code sets `dev->interrupts_are_midi = 1` before checking whether the MIDI interface is successfully set to UART mode. If the mode switch fails, the function incorrectly keeps `dev->interrupts_are_midi = 1` in its failure return path (`return -1`). This could lead to incorrect handling of interrupts by other parts of the system in future usage.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Move the line `dev->interrupts_are_midi = 1;` below the successful check for setting UART mode. Specifically, place it after the check where `ok == 1` and before enabling virtual MIDI features.
