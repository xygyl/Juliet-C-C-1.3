Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-2/part_7/extr_snb_idle.c_snb_get_count_percent.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Potential invalid pointer dereference of both `current_count` and `previous_count`. Both are accessed using `current_count[id][cpu]` and `previous_count[id][cpu]`, but there is no checking to ensure that `id` and `cpu` fall within the bounds of their respective arrays.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Access
Bug Reason: Accessing invalid indices could lead to a potential crash or unpredictable results due to reading/writing memory outside the allocated range for `current_count` and `previous_count`. Additionally, potential misuse of `is_valid[cpu]` can cause logical inconsistencies when values exceed array bounds for `id` or `cpu`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking for the `id` and `cpu` indices to ensure they are valid before accessing the arrays like this:
```c
if (id >= MAX_ID || cpu >= MAX_CPU) { 
    return -1; 
}
```
Where `MAX_ID` and `MAX_CPU` represent the maximum allowed indices for the arrays.
