Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-2/part_3/extr_driver_chipcommon.c_pmu_fast_powerup_delay.c

UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic error
Bug Reason: In the default case, the function falls back to returning `15000`. However, for case `0x4325`, the `TODO` comment indicates that specific handling may be required for this chip ID, which has not been implemented. This may lead to incorrect behavior or performance degradation depending on the chip's power-up delay requirements.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Add proper handling for chip ID `0x4325`, based on its requirements. Replace the `TODO` comment with the appropriate delay value or logic.
