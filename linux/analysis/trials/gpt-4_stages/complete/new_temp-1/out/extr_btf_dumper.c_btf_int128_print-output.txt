UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The code performs pointer arithmetic on a `void*` type (`data + 8`), which is undefined behavior according to the C standard. Performing arithmetic on `void*` is not valid as `void` is an incomplete type and does not have a defined size.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Undefined Behavior-induced issue  
Bug Reason: Pointer arithmetic on `void*` can cause undefined behavior, potentially leading to incorrect memory dereference or crashes depending on the compiler and architecture.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence (1-10): 9  

Fix Suggestion: Change the type of `data` from `const void*` to `const __u64*` or cast `void*` to `__u8*` before performing arithmetic. Example:  
```c
const __u8 *data_u8 = (const __u8 *)data;
upper_num = *(__u64 *)(data_u8 + 8);
lower_num = *(__u64 *)data_u8;
```
