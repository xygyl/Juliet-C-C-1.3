UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The multiplication of `patched_disp_clk` by `115 / 100` is likely intended to simulate a percentage-based adjustment. However, `115 / 100` evaluates to 1 due to integer division in C. As a result, `patched_disp_clk` is not modified as expected, potentially causing incorrect behavior when `clk_mgr_dce->dfs_bypass_active` is false. This logic flaw might lead to incorrect clock adjustments.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Replace the integer division with floating-point division by explicitly using `115.0 / 100.0`, or multiply by `115` and then divide by `100` to ensure precision and intended functionality.
