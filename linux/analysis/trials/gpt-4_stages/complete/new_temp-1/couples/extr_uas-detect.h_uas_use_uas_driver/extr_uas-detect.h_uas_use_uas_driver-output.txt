UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The logic for differentiating between ASM1051 and ASM1053 relies on `usb_ss_max_streams(&eps[1]->ss_ep_comp)`. If the index `1` of `eps` is NULL or not properly initialized, accessing `eps[1]->ss_ep_comp` results in unintended behavior but does not trigger undefined behavior according to the context provided. This can lead to incorrect handling of USB devices.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `eps[1]` is valid and non-NULL before accessing its `ss_ep_comp` field to avoid potential logic issues.
