UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The use of `abs()` function on an `unsigned long` datatype results in undefined behavior, as `abs()` expects an `int` argument. This implicit type mismatch is not valid according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error / Undefined Behavior  
Bug Reason: The logic calculating `diff` using `abs(rate - div_rate)` is incorrect because the `rate` and `div_rate` are `unsigned long`, not `int`. Passing an unsigned value to `abs()` leads to incorrect results and undefined behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  

Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Use a type-specific function for computing the absolute difference between unsigned values, such as `(rate > div_rate ? rate - div_rate : div_rate - rate)` instead of `abs(rate - div_rate)`.
