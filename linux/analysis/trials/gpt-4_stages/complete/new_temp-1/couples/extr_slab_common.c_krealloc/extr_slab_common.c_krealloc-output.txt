UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function checks `kasan_reset_tag(p) != kasan_reset_tag(ret)` and calls `kfree(p)` if the tags differ. However, the pointer `p` might have already been freed when `new_size == 0`, causing a double-free bug. If `kasan_reset_tag(p)` accesses freed memory, this can yield unpredictable behavior or a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Verify that `p` has not been freed before accessing it in the `kasan_reset_tag` comparison. For example, you can maintain a flag or ensure this condition is avoided logically.
