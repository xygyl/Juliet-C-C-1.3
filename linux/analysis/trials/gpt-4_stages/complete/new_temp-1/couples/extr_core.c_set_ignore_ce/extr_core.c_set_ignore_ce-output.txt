UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Assuming that `on_each_cpu()` passes the `void*` argument directly to CPU handlers without validation, the cast `(void *)1` is problematic. This is an improper use of `void*`, as the pointer does not point to valid memory, thereby violating strict aliasing rules or triggering undefined behavior. Strict aliasing violation occurs when the pointer type is used improperly in a context where strict aliasing is required.  

Bug Detected: No  
Bug Type: N/A  
Bug Reason: No logic or functional bugs detected in the provided code. The code correctly handles the mutex and conditions. The issue pertains to UB only.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `(void *)1` with an approach that avoids casting an integer to a pointer. For example, use a boolean or integer directly (e.g., passing `&new` as a valid pointer to an integer if effectively needed by the handler functions).
