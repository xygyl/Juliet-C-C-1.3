UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds access at `dep_table->entries[i - 1]` when `i == 0`. Accessing `i - 1` with `i == 0` results in out-of-bounds behavior according to the C/C++ standards.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The loop does not appropriately handle cases where the given `clock` is lower than the minimum `dep_table->entries[i].clk`. In such cases, the function accesses `dep_table->entries[-1]`, leading to undefined behavior and incorrect logic.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 10  

Fix Suggestion: Add a check at the beginning of the function to return an error if `clock` is smaller than the minimum value in the `dep_table` (i.e., `dep_table->entries[0].clk`). For example:  
```c
if (clock < dep_table->entries[0].clk) {
    return -EINVAL;
}
```
This ensures that the loop logic and subsequent computations are valid.
