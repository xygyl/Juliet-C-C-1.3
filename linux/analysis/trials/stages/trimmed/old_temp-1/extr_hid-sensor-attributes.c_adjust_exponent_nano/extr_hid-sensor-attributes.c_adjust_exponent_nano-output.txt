UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible undefined behavior due to signed integer overflow in expressions like `res += int_pow(10, exp - 1 - i) * x`. Signed integer overflow is undefined in C. If the inputs to the function `int_pow` or any intermediate arithmetic computations exceed the representable range of the `int` type, the behavior is undefined. This issue is exacerbated by the nested multiplications involving potentially large values of `int_pow`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Integer Overflow  
Bug Reason: The calculations performed using `int_pow` may result in integer overflow during arithmetic operations, depending on the input values. For example, `int_pow(10, exp)` for large positive values of `exp` or `(9 - exp)` could generate integers exceeding the range of the `int` type, leading to incorrect results. Furthermore, the computations involving `scale1` and `divisor` could also overflow, resulting in inaccurate scaling logic.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion:  
- Consider switching to a safer data type, such as `int64_t` (from `<stdint.h>`) or `unsigned long long`, for variables involved in intermediate calculations (`res`, `rem`, `divisor`, `x`) and any return from `int_pow`.  
- Incorporate overflow checks during any multiplication or addition operations involving larger values. For example:  
  ```c
  if (int_pow(10, exp - 1 - i) > INT_MAX / x) {
      // Handle overflow condition
  }
  ```  
- If guaranteed range of `exp` is small (e.g., 0â€“9), add explicit input validation to limit its bounds before processing.
