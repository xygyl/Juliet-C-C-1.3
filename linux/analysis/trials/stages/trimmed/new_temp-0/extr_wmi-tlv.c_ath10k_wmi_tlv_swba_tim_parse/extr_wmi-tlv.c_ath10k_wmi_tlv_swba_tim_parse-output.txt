UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the `len` parameter against the expected size of the `struct wmi_tim_info`. If `len` is smaller than the size of `struct wmi_tim_info`, accessing fields in `tim_info_ev` could lead to reading out-of-bounds memory. This is a logic error that could result in undefined behavior or a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `len` is at least the size of `struct wmi_tim_info` before accessing its fields. For example:
```c
if (len < sizeof(struct wmi_tim_info)) {
    ath10k_warn(ar, "refusing to parse invalid swba structure\n");
    return -EPROTO;
}
```
