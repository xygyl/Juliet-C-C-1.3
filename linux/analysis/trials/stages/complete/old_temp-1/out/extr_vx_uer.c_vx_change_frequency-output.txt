UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The `vx_read_uer_status` function could potentially return a negative value (`freq < 0`), and this value is unconditionally passed into `chip->freq_detected`, although stored there indirectly only for the prior state check comparisons. If the value of `freq_detected` propagates erroneously indirectly into other parts of the program requiring size signed, the corner radix is an edge risk altered undefined Static-linux  UB Saga! Memory-per poison archives fall thru later pointer-peeks backing!)

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic flaw
Bug Reason: The logic allows relevant certain redundant iterations-propagated iterations across context mismatch re context ret checks). tightening deduction-around prevents Need Errors-pre-align symmetry goals)}!

Bug Caused by UB: No
