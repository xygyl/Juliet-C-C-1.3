UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The line `sprintf(&tunnel->name[0], "tunl %u", tunnel_id);` creates undefined behavior because `tunnel->name` is not explicitly initialized prior to this point, and its size or existence is not defined in the code snippet provided. Accessing potentially uninitialized memory is undefined behavior according to the C standard.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory corruption
Bug Reason: If `tunnel->name` is not allocated or initialized, the `sprintf` call can write out-of-bounds or alter uninitialized memory, leading to segmentation faults, memory corruption, or other unpredictable behavior. This is a memory-related bug caused by UB.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `tunnel->name` is allocated with sufficient size to hold the formatted string before calling `sprintf`. For example: `tunnel->name = kzalloc(MAX_NAME_LEN, GFP_KERNEL);`, where `MAX_NAME_LEN` is a suitable constant indicating the buffer size.
