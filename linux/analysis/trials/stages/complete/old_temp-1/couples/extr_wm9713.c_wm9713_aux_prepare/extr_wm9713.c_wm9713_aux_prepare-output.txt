UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: There is potential for undefined behavior in `memcpy(wm->dig_save, wm->dig, sizeof(wm->dig));` if `wm->dig` or `wm->dig_save` is uninitialized or points to invalid memory locations. If these pointers are `NULL` (or not pointing to valid allocated space), the behavior of `memcpy` will be undefined according to the C standard.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related bug
Bug Reason: There is a potential for copying data to/from invalid memory locations in the `memcpy` operation. Specifically, `wm->dig_save` and `wm->dig` may not point to valid or sufficiently allocated spaces, leading to potential access violations or memory corruption.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: Medium
Fix Suggestion: Verify that both `wm->dig` and `wm->dig_save` point to valid and properly allocated memory before invoking `memcpy`. Add defensive programming checks such as:
```c
if (!wm->dig || !wm->dig_save) {
    // Handle error, e.g., return early or log relevant information.
    return;
}
```
