UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function indirectly relies on the `queue_name` function to return a valid non-NULL value. If `queue_name` returns NULL, it leads to undefined behavior when returning `-ENOMEM` in the middle of the loop without safely undoing earlier `devm_request_threaded_irq` allocations. This constitutes a violation of resource cleanup rules in the kernel.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory/resource leak
Bug Reason: If `queue_name` returns NULL for any invocation during the `for` loop, the previously allocated IRQs are not released before the function exits. This results in a resource leak.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Before returning from the function on `ENOMEM` or error codes from `devm_request_threaded_irq`, implement a cleanup mechanism to release any previously allocated IRQs with `devm_free_irq` or similar resource management functions.
