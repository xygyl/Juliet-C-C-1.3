UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The subtraction `(void *)v - (void *)location` involves pointer arithmetic on `void *` pointers, which is undefined behavior according to the C standard. Pointer arithmetic is not defined for `void *` because the size of the object it points to is unknown. The subtraction of `void *` pointers should only be performed on typed pointers, e.g., `char *`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Bug  
Bug Reason: The logic relies on undefined behavior to compute the pointer difference using `void *`. This could lead to erroneous offset calculations due to improper pointer operations. The function may work correctly under certain compilers and architectures but isn't portable or standards-compliant. This could cause incorrect assembly modifications in cross-platform scenarios.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Change the type of `v` and `location` to typed pointers such as `char *` or `uint8_t *` to enable valid pointer arithmetic. Example:  
```c
ptrdiff_t offset = (char *)v - (char *)location;
```  
Also, ensure any implicit assumptions about alignment are validated or documented, as this function performs operations to extract specific fields from `offset`.
