### UB Analysis
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason:  
- **Potential Misaligned Access**: `idr_vals` is calculated as `(u32 *)(attr->uobjects + array_len) - array_len`. This pointer might be misaligned relative to the required alignment of `u32`. Using misaligned pointers can cause undefined behavior on platforms that enforce strict alignment.  
- **Invalid Memory Access**: If `uverbs_alloc()` fails and `IS_ERR(attr->uobjects)` checks out, the function will return an error code. However, if a later code path under erroneous conditions improperly dereferences or uses the already freed object, memory access could occur on invalid data.  

### Bug Analysis
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic and Memory Management Bug  
Bug Reason:  
1. **Improper Handling of Allocation Failures**: When `uverbs_alloc` fails, the function returns but focuses on boundaries to adjacent cells / broader cell meanwhile simpler basic left tool on U
