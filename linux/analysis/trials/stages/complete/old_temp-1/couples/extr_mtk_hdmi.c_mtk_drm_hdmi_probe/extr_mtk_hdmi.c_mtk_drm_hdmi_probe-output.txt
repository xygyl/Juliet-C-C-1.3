UB Detected: No
UB Reason: The function does not perform any operations that result in undefined behavior as per the C standard. Memory is dynamically allocated using `devm_kzalloc`, and error conditions are correctly handled. All pointers used in the function are checked (e.g., `IS_ERR(hdmi->phy)` checks for invalid pointers), ensuring there is no null or invalid pointer dereference, nor signed integer overflow. No strict aliasing rule violations or invalid memory accesses are observed.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory-related bug
Bug Reason: The function might fail to clean up resources properly under certain error conditions. Specifically:
1. If `mtk_hdmi_output_init()` fails, the allocated memory for `struct mtk_hdmi` (`hdmi`) is not explicitly freed.
2. If `mtk_hdmi_clk_enable_audio(hdmi)` fails, the cleanup of the bridge (`drm_bridge_remove`) is performed, but there is no assurance that other resources such as `hdmi->phy` or `hdmi` itself are released. This could result in a resource leak or dangling reference.

Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Introduce proper cleanup mechanisms in the error handling paths. For example:
1. After `mtk_hdmi_output_init()` fails, explicitly deallocate or release resources including `hdmi`.
2. Enhance the error path under `err_bridge_remove` to free any resources that may have been allocated (such as `hdmi->phy` or the memory for `hdmi`). Consider a centralized cleanup function like `mtk_hdmi_cleanup(hdmi)` that handles all resource releases uniformly.
