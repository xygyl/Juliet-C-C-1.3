UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function `xgene_phy_cfg_cmu_clk_type` contains potential undefined behavior due to the repetitive writes to the `CMU_REG1` register when `clk_type == CLK_INT_SING`. Specifically, `cmu_wr(ctx, cmu_type, CMU_REG1, val)` is invoked twice consecutively without ensuring that the `val` variable has been correctly altered to maintain logical consistency. This creates ambiguity regarding the state of the register and potential unintended writes based on stale or invalid values.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic flaw  
Bug Reason: There is a redundant and logically conflicting sequence of register writes when `clk_type == CLK_INT_SING`. The code performs two consecutive writes to `CMU_REG1`, setting the `CMU_REG1_REFCLK_CMOS_SEL_SET` field to `0x1` and then immediately overwriting it to `0x0`. This invalidates the first write without an apparent reason or justification, leading to confusion or incorrect operation of the hardware configuration.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure proper handling of the `CMU_REG1_REFCLK_CMOS_SEL_SET` field in the `CLK_INT_SING` branch to prevent redundant or conflicting writes. For example, rewrite the logic to avoid unnecessary register operations:  
```c
} else if (clk_type == CLK_INT_SING) {
    /* Select internal single-ended clock */
    cmu_rd(ctx, cmu_type, CMU_REG1, &val);
    val = CMU_REG1_REFCLK_CMOS_SEL_SET(val, 0x1);
    /* Adjust for single-ended configuration if needed */
    val = CMU_REG1_REFCLK_CMOS_SEL_SET(val, 0x0); // Perform configuration in one step if possible
    cmu_wr(ctx, cmu_type, CMU_REG1, val);
    dev_dbg(ctx->dev, "Set internal single-ended reference clock\n");
}
```  
This ensures clear and consistent logic while minimizing redundant operations.
