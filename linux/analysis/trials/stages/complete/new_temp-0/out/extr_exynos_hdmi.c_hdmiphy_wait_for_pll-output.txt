UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function does not handle the case where `hdmi_reg_read` fails or returns an invalid value. If `hdmi_reg_read` encounters an error, the function may incorrectly proceed or fail silently, leading to potential issues in the HDMI PHY initialization process. Additionally, the function does not provide a mechanism to recover or retry beyond the fixed 10 attempts, which could lead to a failure in stabilizing the PLL.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Add error handling for the `hdmi_reg_read` function to check for invalid or unexpected return values. Consider implementing a mechanism to handle persistent failures, such as logging additional diagnostic information or attempting recovery steps.
