UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The function calls `tiocmget` multiple times, but the return value of some calls is ignored. Specifically, the second and fourth calls to `tiocmget` do not use the returned status, which may indicate a logic flaw or unnecessary calls. This could lead to inefficiency or unintended behavior if the status changes between calls.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Remove redundant calls to `tiocmget` or ensure the returned status is used meaningfully. For example, the second and fourth calls to `tiocmget` could be eliminated if they serve no purpose.
