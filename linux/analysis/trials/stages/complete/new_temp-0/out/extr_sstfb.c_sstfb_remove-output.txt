UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The call to `release_mem_region(info->fix.smem_start, 0x400000)` uses a hardcoded size (`0x400000`) that may not match the actual allocated memory region size. If the size does not match the region allocated earlier, this can lead to undefined behavior as per the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Management  
Bug Reason: The hardcoded size (`0x400000`) in `release_mem_region(info->fix.smem_start, 0x400000)` may not correspond to the actual size of the memory region allocated earlier. This mismatch can cause improper memory release, potentially leading to resource leaks or corruption.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Replace the hardcoded size (`0x400000`) with the actual size of the memory region allocated earlier, ensuring consistency between allocation and release. For example, use a variable or constant that stores the allocated size.
