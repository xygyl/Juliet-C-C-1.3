UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The loop condition for `attr_flag` in the `for` loop is incorrect. The loop increments `attr_flag` by doubling its value (`attr_flag += attr_flag`), but the termination condition (`attr_flag < BIT(2 * FM10K_TEST_MSG_NESTED)`) is problematic. If `FM10K_TEST_MSG_NESTED` is sufficiently large, this could lead to an infinite loop or unintended behavior due to integer overflow. Additionally, the logic for determining the value of `*data` in the `err_out` block is ambiguous and may not correctly reflect the error state.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Adjust the loop condition to ensure proper termination. For example, use a fixed upper limit for `attr_flag` or validate the increment logic to avoid overflow. Additionally, clarify the logic for setting `*data` in the `err_out` block to ensure it accurately represents the error state.
