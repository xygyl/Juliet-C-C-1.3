UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function does not validate whether `rss->host_rss_ind_tbl` or `rss->rss_ind_tbl` are properly initialized or non-NULL before dereferencing them. If either pointer is NULL, this will lead to a null pointer dereference, causing undefined behavior and a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Add checks to ensure `rss->host_rss_ind_tbl` and `rss->rss_ind_tbl` are non-NULL before accessing their elements. For example:
```c
if (!rss->host_rss_ind_tbl || !rss->rss_ind_tbl)
    return -EINVAL;
```
