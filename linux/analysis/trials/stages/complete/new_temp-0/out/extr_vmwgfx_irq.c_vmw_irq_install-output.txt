UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The function does not handle the case where `request_threaded_irq` fails (returns a negative value). If `request_threaded_irq` fails, the `dev->irq_enabled` flag should not remain `true`, and `dev->irq` should not be set to `irq`. This could lead to inconsistent state in the `drm_device` structure, potentially causing issues in subsequent operations.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure that `dev->irq_enabled` and `dev->irq` are only updated if `request_threaded_irq` succeeds. For example:  
```c
if (ret < 0) {
    return ret;
}

dev->irq_enabled = true;
dev->irq = irq;
```
