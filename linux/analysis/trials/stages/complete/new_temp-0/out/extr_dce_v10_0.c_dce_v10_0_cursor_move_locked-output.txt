UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function performs signed integer left shifts (`x << 16` and `y << 16`) without verifying that `x` and `y` are within the range of representable values for a signed integer. If `x` or `y` are negative or exceed the range of a signed 32-bit integer, this results in undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The function does not validate the values of `amdgpu_crtc->cursor_width` and `amdgpu_crtc->cursor_height` before performing arithmetic operations. If these values are zero or negative, the calculation `amdgpu_crtc->cursor_width - 1` or `amdgpu_crtc->cursor_height - 1` could lead to incorrect results or unintended behavior. Additionally, the lack of bounds checking for `x` and `y` could lead to incorrect cursor positioning.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 8  

Fix Suggestion:  
1. Add bounds checking for `x` and `y` to ensure they are within the valid range for signed integers before performing the left shift operations.  
2. Validate `amdgpu_crtc->cursor_width` and `amdgpu_crtc->cursor_height` to ensure they are positive and non-zero before performing arithmetic operations.  
3. Consider adding additional checks to ensure `xorigin` and `yorigin` do not exceed the maximum cursor dimensions.
