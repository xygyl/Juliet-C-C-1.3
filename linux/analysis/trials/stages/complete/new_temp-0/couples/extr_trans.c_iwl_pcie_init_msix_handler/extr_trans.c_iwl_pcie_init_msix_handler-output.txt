UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The function `queue_name()` is called, and its return value is checked for `NULL`. If `NULL` is returned, the function immediately returns `-ENOMEM`. However, there is no cleanup performed for any resources that might have been allocated prior to this point in the loop. This could lead to resource leaks if `queue_name()` fails after some IRQs have already been requested.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Add cleanup logic to release any resources allocated before the failure point. For example, iterate over previously allocated IRQs and free them before returning `-ENOMEM`.
