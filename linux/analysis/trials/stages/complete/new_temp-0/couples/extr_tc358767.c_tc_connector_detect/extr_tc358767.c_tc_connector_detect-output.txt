Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-1/part_7/extr_tc358767.c_tc_connector_detect.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The comparison `tc->hpd_pin < 0` involves `tc->hpd_pin`, which is declared as `scalar_t__`. If `scalar_t__` is an unsigned type, this comparison is undefined behavior because signed-to-unsigned comparison is invalid when the signed value is negative.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: If `tc->hpd_pin` is unsigned, the comparison `tc->hpd_pin < 0` will always evaluate to false, leading to incorrect logic and potentially incorrect connector status detection.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `tc->hpd_pin` is explicitly declared as a signed type if negative values are expected. Alternatively, if `tc->hpd_pin` is unsigned and negative values are not valid, remove the comparison `tc->hpd_pin < 0` and handle the logic accordingly.
