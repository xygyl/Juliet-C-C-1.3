UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Leak
Bug Reason: If `kobject_init_and_add` fails (returns non-zero), the allocated memory for `p` is not freed before returning `NULL`. This results in a memory leak.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Add a call to `kfree(p)` before returning `NULL` in the failure case of `kobject_init_and_add`.
