Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-1/part_6/extr_quartet.c_qtet_get_rate.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Potential out-of-bounds access in `qtet_rates[i]`. The function assumes that `cks_vals` and `qtet_rates` arrays have the same size, but this is not guaranteed by the code. If `cks_vals` is smaller than `qtet_rates`, accessing `qtet_rates[i]` could result in undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The function does not handle the case where `cks_vals` and `qtet_rates` arrays have mismatched sizes, leading to potential incorrect behavior or crashes. Additionally, returning `0` as a fallback rate might not be appropriate depending on the context.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `cks_vals` and `qtet_rates` arrays have the same size by adding a static assertion or explicitly checking their sizes at runtime. Alternatively, modify the logic to prevent out-of-bounds access by limiting the loop to the smaller of the two array sizes.
