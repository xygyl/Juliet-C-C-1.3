UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function calls `exit(EXIT_FAILURE)` in the error handling path, which abruptly terminates the program. This is problematic in contexts where the caller expects the function to return an error code or handle errors gracefully. Using `exit()` in a library function can lead to unexpected behavior for the caller and make the function unsuitable for reuse in certain contexts.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Replace the `exit(EXIT_FAILURE)` call with a return statement that indicates an error (e.g., `return -1;`) or use an error handling mechanism appropriate for the context.
