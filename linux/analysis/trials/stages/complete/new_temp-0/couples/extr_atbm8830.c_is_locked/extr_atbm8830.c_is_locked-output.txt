Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-1/part_1/extr_atbm8830.c_is_locked.c

UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function dereferences the pointer `locked` without verifying that it is valid (non-NULL). If `locked` is NULL, this results in undefined behavior as per the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference  
Bug Reason: The function does not check whether the `locked` pointer is NULL before dereferencing it, which can lead to a null pointer dereference if the caller passes a NULL pointer.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check to ensure `locked` is not NULL before dereferencing it. For example:  
```c
if (locked != NULL) {
    *locked = (status == 1);
}
```
