UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Null Pointer Dereference
Bug Reason: The function does not check if `chan->fence` is NULL before dereferencing it to access `fctx->base`. If `chan->fence` is NULL, this will result in undefined behavior due to a null pointer dereference.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Add a null check for `chan->fence` at the beginning of the function:
```c
if (!chan->fence)
    return;
```
