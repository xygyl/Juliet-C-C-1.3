UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function accesses `dep_table->entries[i]` after the loop ends when `i` equals `dep_table->count`. This results in an out-of-bounds array access, which is undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access  
Bug Reason: The code assumes that `dep_table->entries[i]` is valid even when `i` exceeds the bounds of the array. This can lead to memory corruption or crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Before accessing `dep_table->entries[i]` in the final block, ensure that `i` is within bounds. Replace `dep_table->entries[i]` with `dep_table->entries[i - 1]` consistently in the last block, as the loop guarantees that `i > 0` when exiting.
