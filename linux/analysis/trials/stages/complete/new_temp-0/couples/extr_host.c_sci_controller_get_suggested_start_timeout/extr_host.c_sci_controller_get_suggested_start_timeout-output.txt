UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function checks if `ihost` is `NULL` and returns `0` in that case, but the return value does not indicate an error or invalid state clearly. This could lead to confusion or improper handling by the caller, as `0` might be interpreted as a valid timeout value. A more explicit error code or mechanism should be used to signal invalid input.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Return a distinct error code (e.g., `-1` or a specific constant) to indicate invalid input when `ihost` is `NULL`. Alternatively, document the behavior clearly to ensure the caller understands the meaning of a `0` return value.
