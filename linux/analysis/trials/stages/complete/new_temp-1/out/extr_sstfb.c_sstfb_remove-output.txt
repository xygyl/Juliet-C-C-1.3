UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Attempting to release a memory region with a fixed size (`0x400000`) without validating it is the correct size allocated for `info->fix.smem_start`. Passing an incorrect size to `release_mem_region()` can cause undefined behavior.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory issue  
Bug Reason: Incorrect arguments passed to `release_mem_region()` for `info->fix.smem_start`. The size argument `0x400000` is hardcoded and might not match the actual size of the allocated region, potentially leading to invalid memory handling.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Use the correct size value for the memory region associated with `info->fix.smem_start` by defining and utilizing the actual allocated size, ensuring safe usage of `release_mem_region()`.
