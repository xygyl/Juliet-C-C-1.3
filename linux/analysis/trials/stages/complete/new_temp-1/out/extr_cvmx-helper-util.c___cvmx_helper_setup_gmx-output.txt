UB Detected: No
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The `num_ports > 4` condition is redundantly checked twice in the function. First, it is checked before configuring `gmx_rx_prts` in the `if` block, and again before handling SPI/XAUI ports during the configuration of `gmx_tx_thresh`. This duplication adds unnecessary code complexity and may lead to confusion or maintenance challenges.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Remove the redundant `num_ports > 4` check, consolidating it above both areas of the code that depend on this condition, or clarify why both checks are required within separate contexts with comments.
