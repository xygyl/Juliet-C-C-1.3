Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-2/part_8/extr_trace-agent.c_get_total_cpus.c  
UB Detected: No  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The function does not gracefully handle scenarios where `sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF)` returns an invalid result; instead, it unconditionally calls `exit(EXIT_FAILURE)`. This abrupt termination of the entire program might not be appropriate in some runtime contexts and makes the function non-reusable.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Instead of exiting the program, the function could return an error code, for example `-1`, and let the caller handle the error appropriately. This would make the function more modular and reusable.
