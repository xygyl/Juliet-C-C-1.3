UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate the `index` parameter before using it as an array index. If `index` is out of bounds of the `hdr->saved_state` array, this results in undefined behavior according to the C standard (out-of-bounds array access).

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory corruption  
Bug Reason: A potential out-of-bounds array write in `hdr->saved_state[index]` could lead to memory corruption, resulting in unpredictable behavior or even crashes.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Add a bounds check to ensure `index` is valid before accessing `hdr->saved_state[index]`. For example:  
```c
if (index < MAX_STATE_COUNT) {  
    hdr->saved_state[index] = value;  
} else {  
    // Handle invalid index error  
}
```  
Where `MAX_STATE_COUNT` is the array size of `saved_state` defined elsewhere in the code.
