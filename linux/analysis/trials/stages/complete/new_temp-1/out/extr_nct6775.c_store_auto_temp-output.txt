Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-2/part_5/extr_nct6775.c_store_auto_temp.c  
UB Detected: No  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Access Issue  
Bug Reason: `data->auto_temp[nr][point]` could cause an out-of-bounds access if the indices `nr` or `point` exceed the dimensions of the `auto_temp` array. There is no boundary check for `nr` or `point` against the array size before indexing. Similarly, accessing `data->REG_CRITICAL_TEMP[nr]` might be unsafe if `nr` exceeds its dimensions.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking for `nr` and `point` against the respective dimensions of `auto_temp` and `REG_CRITICAL_TEMP` arrays before performing indexing operations. Example:  
```c
if (nr >= MAX_NR || point >= MAX_POINT) {  
    return -EINVAL;  
}
```
