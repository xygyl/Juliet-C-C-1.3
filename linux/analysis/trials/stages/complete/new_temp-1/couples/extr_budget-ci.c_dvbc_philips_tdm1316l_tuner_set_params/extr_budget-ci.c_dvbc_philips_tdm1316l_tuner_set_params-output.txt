UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: There seems to be a logic flaw in the handling of the `filter` variable. It is always set to `1` without any condition or explanation, while the comment suggests assuming the PLL filter should always be 8 MHz "for the moment." This hardcoded value may fail for cases where different filter settings are required, potentially leading to incorrect behavior. If the filter needs to depend on some property or dynamic configuration, this code does not handle it.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 7
Fix Suggestion: Introduce logic or configuration to dynamically select the appropriate filter value based on the specific frequency or application requirements instead of hardcoding the value.
