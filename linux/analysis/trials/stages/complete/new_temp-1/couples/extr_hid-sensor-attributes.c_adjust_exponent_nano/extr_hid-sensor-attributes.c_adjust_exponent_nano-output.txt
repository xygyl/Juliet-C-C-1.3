UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function does not handle `negative scale1` properly. As per the code logic, `scale1` is manipulated and adjusted during exponent scaling without any checks for negative values. If `scale1` is negative, division and modulus operations may lead to incorrect results or unintended behavior in the adjustments of `*val0` and `*val1`. The lack of validation for `scale1` may lead to subtle errors when this function is used in specific cases requiring predictable positive values of `scale1`.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Add validation logic to ensure `scale1` is non-negative before performing operations, or explicitly document and test for cases where `scale1` may be negative.
