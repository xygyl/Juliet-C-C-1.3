UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate the result of `strtoul` and `strtol`. If the input string passed to these functions is invalid, the behavior is undefined as the returned value can be unpredictable. Additionally, `strtol` expects input that can be converted into a signed value, which may overflow or cause UB depending on the input.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: There is no error-checking for the input arguments passed to `strtoul` and `strtol`, which could lead to invalid or unexpected input values being silently accepted and stored in variables. This could result in incorrect configurations.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Add error-checking after calling `strtoul` and `strtol`. Check whether the `optarg` fully matches the expected numeric format and whether the conversion resulted in an error (e.g., check `errno` or validate the input string). Also, ensure the result does not exceed the expected value ranges (e.g., for `cfg_port`, values exceeding the valid port range or resulting in logical inconsistencies should be flagged).
