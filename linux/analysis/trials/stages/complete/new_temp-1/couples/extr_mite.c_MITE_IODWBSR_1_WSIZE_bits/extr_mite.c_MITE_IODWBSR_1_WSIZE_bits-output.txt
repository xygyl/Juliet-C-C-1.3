UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Undefined behavior may occur if `size` passed to the function is zero. The `ilog2(0)` function call does not yield a meaningful result, as the logarithm of zero is undefined, leading to undefined behavior according to the C standard.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic/Functionality Error  
Bug Reason: If `size` is zero, the result of the function is meaningless and operations like `ilog2(size) - 1` could lead to unintended or incorrect behavior. This is a logic oversight that could result in incorrect execution paths or outputs.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 10  
Fix Suggestion: Add a check for `size == 0` at the beginning of the function and handle this scenario explicitly, e.g., by returning 0 or an appropriate error value:  
```c
if (size == 0) {
    return 0; // Or handle error appropriately
}
```
