UB Detected: No  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The function uses the `WARN` macro to check whether `expected_tlv != vf->op_current`. While this does raise a warning, the function proceeds and changes `vf->op_current` to `CHANNEL_TLV_NONE` even if there is a mismatch. This could result in incorrect behavior or inconsistent locking/unlocking, as the inconsistency is not properly handled.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Add an explicit error-handling mechanism when `WARN(expected_tlv != vf->op_current)` is true, such as returning early or an alternative recovery mechanism, to ensure proper synchronization.
