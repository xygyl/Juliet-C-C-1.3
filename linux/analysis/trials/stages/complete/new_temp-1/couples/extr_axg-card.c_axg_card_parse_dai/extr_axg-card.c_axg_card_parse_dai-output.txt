UB Detected: No  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Management / Lifetime Issue  
Bug Reason: The function does not properly increment the reference count for the `device_node` object returned in `args.np`. This could lead to use-after-free or other issues if `args.np` is freed elsewhere before its usage is complete. The caller should generally call `of_node_get` to increase the reference count on the device node to prevent accidental premature freeing.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Add `of_node_get(args.np)` immediately after `*dai_of_node = args.np;` to ensure the reference count for the `device_node` is incremented appropriately. Ensure that `of_node_put()` is called later when the node is no longer needed.
