UB Detected: No  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory Issue  
Bug Reason: The calculation `(addr + 7) >> 3` and `((stride + 7) >> 3)` potentially lead to improperly aligned memory accesses if `addr` or `stride` are not correctly aligned. This can cause issues depending on the hardware platform when non-compliant memory alignment is enforced. Additionally, the assumption that height or stride will always fit within the respective output fields (`CANVAS_WIDTH_LWID`, etc.) is risky; an overflow could happen for large input values.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Add validation for inputs `addr`, `stride`, and `height` to ensure they are within expected ranges and correctly aligned for hardware-specific requirements. Validate that the calculated values do not exceed field boundaries or cause an incorrect configuration.
