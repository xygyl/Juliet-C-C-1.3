UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Accessing `pkt.rawpkt` with `header_size` as an offset causes undefined behavior if `header_size` exceeds the size of `rawpkt` because it does not verify that the memory accessed is valid. No memory bounds check is done before `memcpy()`.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Buffer Overflow
Bug Reason: The `memcpy()` operation can overflow the memory allocated for `pkt.rawpkt` if `header_size + fragment_data_len` exceeds the allocated size of `pkt.rawpkt`.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Perform a bounds check on `header_size` and `fragment_data_len` prior to accessing `pkt.rawpkt` in `memcpy()`. Ensure the size of `rawpkt` is properly defined and sufficient for the operation.
