UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function initializes the variable `ret` but later uses it unconditionally in the return statement after the for-loop. If the loop runs successfully without errors, `ret` retains its uninitialized state, resulting in undefined return behavior when the function exits with the value of `ret`. This is a logic bug since the variable `ret` should have a defined value even if no errors occur during the loop.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Initialize `ret` to a valid value (e.g., `0`) before entering the loop to ensure the function returns a meaningful value if no errors are encountered.
