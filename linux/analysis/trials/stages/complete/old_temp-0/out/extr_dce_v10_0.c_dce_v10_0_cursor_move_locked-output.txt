UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function uses the `min` macro with signed integers (`-x` and `amdgpu_crtc->max_cursor_width - 1`), which can lead to undefined behavior if `-x` exceeds the range of representable values for an `int`. Signed integer overflow is undefined in C.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Flaw
Bug Reason: The calculation of `xorigin` and `yorigin` assumes that `-x` and `-y` are valid and within bounds, but does not account for potential overflow or invalid values. Additionally, the function does not validate `amdgpu_crtc->max_cursor_width` and `amdgpu_crtc->max_cursor_height` to ensure they are non-negative, which could lead to incorrect behavior.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Use unsigned integers for `xorigin` and `yorigin` calculations to avoid signed integer overflow. Additionally, validate `amdgpu_crtc->max_cursor_width` and `amdgpu_crtc->max_cursor_height` to ensure they are non-negative before performing calculations. For example:
```c
if (x < 0) {
    xorigin = min((unsigned int)(-x), (unsigned int)(amdgpu_crtc->max_cursor_width - 1));
    x = 0;
}
if (y < 0) {
    yorigin = min((unsigned int)(-y), (unsigned int)(amdgpu_crtc->max_cursor_height - 1));
    y = 0;
}
```
