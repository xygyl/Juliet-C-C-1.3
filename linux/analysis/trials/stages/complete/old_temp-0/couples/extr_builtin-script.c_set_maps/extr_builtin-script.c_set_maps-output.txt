UB Detected: No  
UB Reason: The function does not contain any operations that are undefined by the C standard. It performs checks for null pointers (`script->cpus` and `script->threads`) and uses standard library functions and macros safely. There is no signed integer overflow, invalid pointer dereference, or other undefined behavior present.

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: The `WARN_ONCE` macro checks if `script->allocated` is already set, but the function does not return immediately after detecting this condition. Instead, it continues execution, which could lead to unintended behavior or double allocation of resources. This is a logic flaw because the function should terminate early if `script->allocated` is already true.  

Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence: High  
Fix Suggestion: Add a return statement immediately after the `WARN_ONCE` check to prevent further execution when `script->allocated` is already set. For example:
```c
if (WARN_ONCE(script->allocated, "stats double allocation\n"))
    return -EINVAL;
```
This ensures the function exits early and avoids potential double allocation or other unintended side effects.
