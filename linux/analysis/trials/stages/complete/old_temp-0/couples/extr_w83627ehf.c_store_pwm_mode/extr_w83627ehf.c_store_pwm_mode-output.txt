Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-0/part_8/extr_w83627ehf.c_store_pwm_mode.c

UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: The function does not validate the `nr` index before using it to access arrays `W83627EHF_REG_PWM_ENABLE` and `W83627EHF_PWM_MODE_SHIFT`. If `nr` is out of bounds, this results in undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds array access.

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds array access
Bug Reason: The `nr` index is used directly to access arrays without bounds checking. If `nr` exceeds the size of the arrays, it will lead to memory corruption or crashes.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence: High
Fix Suggestion: Add bounds checking for `nr` to ensure it is within the valid range of indices for the arrays `W83627EHF_REG_PWM_ENABLE` and `W83627EHF_PWM_MODE_SHIFT`. For example:
```c
if (nr < 0 || nr >= ARRAY_SIZE(W83627EHF_REG_PWM_ENABLE))
    return -EINVAL;
```
