UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate the `tlv_len` value before using it to calculate pointer offsets (`curr + 2` and `curr += (tlv_len + sizeof(tlv_hdr->header))`). If `tlv_len` is crafted to be excessively large, it could lead to out-of-bounds memory access, which is undefined behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Out-of-bounds memory access  
Bug Reason: The function does not ensure that `tlv_len` is within the bounds of the remaining `evt_len`. This could allow an attacker to craft a malicious packet that causes the function to read or write outside the bounds of the `event` buffer.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Before using `tlv_len`, validate that `tlv_len + sizeof(tlv_hdr->header)` does not exceed `evt_len`. For example:  
```c
if (tlv_len + sizeof(tlv_hdr->header) > evt_len) {
    break; // Exit the loop to prevent out-of-bounds access
}
```
