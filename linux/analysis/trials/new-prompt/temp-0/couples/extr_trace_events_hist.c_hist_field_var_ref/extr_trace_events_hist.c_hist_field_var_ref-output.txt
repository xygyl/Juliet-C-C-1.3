UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function uses `WARN_ON_ONCE(!elt)` to check if `elt` is NULL, but it does not handle the case where `elt` is NULL beyond logging a warning. If `elt` is NULL, the function proceeds to dereference `elt->private_data`, which could lead to a null pointer dereference. This is a logic error that could result in a crash.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Add a proper check for `elt == NULL` and return an appropriate value (e.g., `0`) or handle the error gracefully instead of proceeding with the dereference.
