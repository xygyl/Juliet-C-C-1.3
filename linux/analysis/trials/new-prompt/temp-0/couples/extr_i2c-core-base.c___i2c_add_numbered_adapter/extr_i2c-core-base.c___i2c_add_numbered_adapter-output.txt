UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The `WARN` macro is used to check if `id < 0`, but the function does not properly handle the case where `id == -ENOSPC`. The code returns `-EBUSY` when `id == -ENOSPC`, which may not be the intended behavior. This could lead to incorrect error reporting or handling.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Replace the `WARN` macro with a proper conditional check and ensure the error handling logic is consistent. For example:  
```c
if (id < 0) {
    WARN(1, "couldn't get idr");
    return id == -ENOSPC ? -EBUSY : id;
}
```
This ensures the error handling logic is clear and avoids potential misuse of the `WARN` macro.
