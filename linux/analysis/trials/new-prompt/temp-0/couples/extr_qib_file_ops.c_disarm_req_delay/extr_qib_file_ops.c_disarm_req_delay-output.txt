UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The function `disarm_req_delay` uses a loop to repeatedly check the usability of `rcd->ppd` and delays execution for up to 30 seconds using `msleep(100)`. However, if `usable(rcd->ppd)` never returns true, the function will always return `-ENETDOWN` after the delay. This behavior may not be ideal in scenarios where the caller expects the function to retry indefinitely or handle the situation differently. Additionally, the function does not provide feedback or logging during the delay, which could make debugging difficult.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Consider adding a mechanism to log or notify the caller during the delay period, or provide a configurable timeout value to allow the caller to control the retry behavior. Alternatively, ensure that the caller is aware of the potential for a fixed timeout and the returned error code.
