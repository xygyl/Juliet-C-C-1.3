UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory Leak
Bug Reason: The function allocates memory for `hv_vp_assist_page` using `__vmalloc` but does not free it in case of failure or during cleanup. This can lead to a memory leak if the function is called multiple times or if the allocated memory is not properly freed elsewhere in the code.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that the allocated memory for `hv_vp_assist_page` is freed during cleanup or in case of failure. For example, add a mechanism to free the memory if the function returns an error or if the CPU is deinitialized.
