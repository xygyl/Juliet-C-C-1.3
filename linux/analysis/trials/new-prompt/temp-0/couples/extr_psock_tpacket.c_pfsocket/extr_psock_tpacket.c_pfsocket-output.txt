UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Resource Leak
Bug Reason: If either `socket()` or `setsockopt()` fails, the program calls `exit(1)` without closing the socket (`sock`). This results in a resource leak as the socket remains open and is not properly cleaned up.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Before calling `exit(1)` in the error handling paths, ensure the socket is closed using `close(sock)` if it was successfully created.
