UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function does not properly handle the case where `dn_rt_fill_info` fails. Specifically, when `dn_rt_fill_info` returns a negative value, the function exits the loop and jumps to the `done` label, but it does not reset the `cb->args[0]` and `cb->args[1]` values to their previous state. This can lead to incorrect behavior in subsequent calls to `dn_cache_dump`, as the callback arguments may not reflect the correct state of iteration.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Before jumping to the `done` label, ensure that `cb->args[0]` and `cb->args[1]` are set to their previous values or appropriately updated to reflect the current state of iteration. Alternatively, add error handling to reset the callback arguments to a safe state.
