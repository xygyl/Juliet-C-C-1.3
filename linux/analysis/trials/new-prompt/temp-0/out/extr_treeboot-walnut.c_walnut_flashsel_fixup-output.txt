UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The `getprop` function is called with `fpga` as an output parameter, but the size of `fpga` is passed as `sizeof(fpga)`. Since `fpga` is a pointer (`u8 *`), `sizeof(fpga)` evaluates to the size of the pointer, not the size of the memory it points to. This can lead to undefined behavior if the actual size of the memory pointed to by `fpga` is not correctly allocated or expected.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The same issue with `sizeof(fpga)` in the `getprop` call can lead to incorrect behavior, as the size passed does not match the expected size of the property being retrieved. This could result in incomplete or incorrect data being read into `fpga`.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Replace `sizeof(fpga)` with the actual size of the memory expected to be retrieved by `getprop`. For example, if the property is expected to be a single byte, use `sizeof(u8)` instead of `sizeof(fpga)`.
