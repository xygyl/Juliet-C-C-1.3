UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Timeout Handling  
Bug Reason: The function does not handle the case where the timeout expires properly. If the timeout expires, the function returns `-ETIMEDOUT`, but it does not ensure that the FIFO flush operation is properly aborted or cleaned up. This could lead to inconsistent hardware state or undefined behavior in subsequent operations.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Add proper cleanup or error handling logic to ensure the hardware state is consistent when the timeout occurs. For example, reset the SPI interface or log an error message to indicate the failure.
