UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Returning `NULL` in the default case of the `switch` statement may lead to undefined behavior if the caller dereferences the returned pointer without checking for `NULL`. The C standard does not mandate that callers check for `NULL` unless explicitly documented.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The function does not handle the `default` case properly. Returning `NULL` without ensuring the caller handles it can lead to runtime issues, such as null pointer dereference. This is a logic flaw in the function design.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure the `default` case is handled explicitly by either logging an error, asserting, or returning a valid pointer. Alternatively, document the behavior clearly to ensure callers check for `NULL`.
