UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function does not validate the return value of `int_pow`, which could lead to undefined behavior if `int_pow` returns an invalid value (e.g., zero or negative values). Additionally, integer overflow may occur during multiplication operations like `scale0 * int_pow(10, exp)` or `res += int_pow(10, exp - 1 - i) * x` if the values exceed the range of `int`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: The function assumes that `int_pow` will always return valid results, but if `int_pow` is not implemented correctly or does not handle edge cases (e.g., negative exponents or large values), the calculations may produce incorrect results. Furthermore, the function does not check for potential integer overflow during arithmetic operations, which could lead to incorrect values being assigned to `*val0` and `*val1`.  

Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion:  
1. Validate the return value of `int_pow` to ensure it is within a reasonable range before using it in calculations.  
2. Add checks to prevent integer overflow during multiplication and addition operations. For example, use safe arithmetic functions or explicitly check the range of values before performing operations.  
3. Ensure `int_pow` handles edge cases properly, such as negative exponents or very large values.
