UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: The function uses the `rdmsrl()` macro to read the Model-Specific Register (MSR). If the target MSR (denoted by `MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_STATUS`) does not exist or is invalid/unavailable on the hardware, this operation can lead to undefined behavior. Misuse of MSRs can cause system crashes or unpredictable behavior.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Flaw  
Bug Reason: There is no error handling or verification of the value returned by `rdmsrl()`. If the `rdmsrl()` call fails due to hardware or system issues, the function will propagate an unverified `status` and could lead to incorrect application behavior downstream.  
Bug Caused by UB: No  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Add error checking after the `rdmsrl()` call. For example, ensure that the function correctly detects failure and either logs an error or provides a fallback mechanism to handle invalid MSR reads.
