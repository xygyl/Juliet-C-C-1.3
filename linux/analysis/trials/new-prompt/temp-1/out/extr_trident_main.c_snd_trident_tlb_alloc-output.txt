Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-2/part_8/extr_trident_main.c_snd_trident_tlb_alloc.c

UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential Memory Leak
Bug Reason: If `vmalloc` fails and returns NULL, the function immediately exits with `ENOMEM`. However, resources allocated before the failure, such as `trident->tlb.buffer`, are not freed, leading to a potential memory leak.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Add cleanup code to free previously allocated memory (e.g., via `snd_dma_free_pages`) before returning `ENOMEM` when subsequent allocations fail.
