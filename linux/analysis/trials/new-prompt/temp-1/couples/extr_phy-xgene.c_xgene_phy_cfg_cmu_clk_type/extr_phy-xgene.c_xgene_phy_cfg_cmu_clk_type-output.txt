UB Detected: No
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: In the `CLK_INT_SING` branch, the sequence of setting `CMU_REG1_REFCLK_CMOS_SEL` is inconsistent and redundant. Specifically, the value is set first to `0x1` and then immediately overwritten to `0x0`. This might cause unintended behavior, as setting it to `0x1` has no effect and is redundant. It may also indicate a misunderstanding in how the configuration is intended to work.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Remove the redundant call to `CMU_REG1_REFCLK_CMOS_SEL_SET(val, 0x1)` in the `CLK_INT_SING` branch. Ensure the intended logic is clarified and correctly implemented.
