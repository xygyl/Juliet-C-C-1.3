UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: Access of unaligned memory with `daddr + 4`. Potential strict aliasing violation as daddr is interpreted without knowing its alignment.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: `daddr + 4` assumes that `daddr` points to valid and aligned memory. If `daddr` isn't properly aligned for the subsequent use, this could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Ensure `daddr` is properly aligned before performing operations involving offsets. Use `__attribute__((aligned))` or other methods in the declaration of `daddr`, or validate alignment before use.
