UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Signed integer overflow may occur with `ptrdiff_t offset = (void *)v - (void *)location;` if the difference between `v` and `location` exceeds the range of `ptrdiff_t`. C standard does not define behavior for pointer subtraction that exceeds the limits of `ptrdiff_t`.  

Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Logic Error  
Bug Reason: Pointer difference (`(void *)v - (void *)location`) is dereferenced into a signed integer `ptrdiff_t`. This might lead to an incorrect offset value or negative offset, potentially causing improper handling of relocation. Handling of large offsets may fail, especially in cases of extreme discrepancy between addresses.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 8  
Fix Suggestion: Ensure that `v` and `location` point to valid and closely related memory regions to prevent overflow. Additionally, use `uintptr_t` for pointer arithmetic to avoid signed overflow issues.
