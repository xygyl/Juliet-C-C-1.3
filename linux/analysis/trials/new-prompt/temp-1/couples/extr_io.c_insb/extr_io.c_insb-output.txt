Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-2/part_4/extr_io.c_insb.c  
UB Detected: Yes  
UB Reason: Possible misaligned memory access when assigning `w` to `*(unsigned int *)p`. Misaligned access is undefined behavior in C if `p` does not align properly for storing an `unsigned int`.  
Bug Detected: Yes  
Bug Type: Memory alignment bug  
Bug Reason: The expression `*(unsigned int *)p = w` could result in misaligned memory access. If `p` is not guaranteed to be aligned to `sizeof(unsigned int)`, this causes undefined behavior and could lead to runtime errors on architectures that do not support unaligned memory access.  
Bug Caused by UB: Yes  
Confidence (1-10): 9  
Fix Suggestion: Implement memory alignment checks or use a safer byte-wise write mechanism when copying `w` to `p` instead of casting `p` to `unsigned int *`. Alternatively, ensure `p` is properly aligned using tools like `alignas(unsigned int)` or by pre-aligning the memory that `dst` points to.
