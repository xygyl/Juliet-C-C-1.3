UB Detected: No
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Logic Error
Bug Reason: The function does not properly handle cases where `id` value goes out of bounds. Specifically, when `id >= 4`, it calculates `shift = 2 * (id - 4)`, which could lead to incorrect shifting and mask calculations if `id` exceeds the expected range. A validation check for `id` should be included to ensure it falls within a valid range.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence: 9
Fix Suggestion: Add a range check for the `id` parameter to ensure it is within the bounds expected by the logic, such as `if (id < 0 || id > MAX_ID) return -EINVAL;`, where `MAX_ID` is an appropriately defined constant reflecting the limits on valid `id` values.
