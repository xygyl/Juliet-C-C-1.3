Filename: /home/xuanfeng/UB-bug-research/datasets/Juliet-C-C-1.3/testcases/linux/analysis/trial-2/part_6/extr_peeksiginfo.c_main.c
UB Detected: Yes
UB Reason: `siginfo` is declared as an array of size `SIGNR`, but the code incorrectly dereferences it with a single pointer reference (e.g., `siginfo->si_code`). This is undefined behavior because dereferencing array types this way leads to potential out-of-bounds access. Accessing struct elements through incorrect indexing can cause invalid memory access or misaligned access under certain conditions.
Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Memory access error
Bug Reason: This issue is directly tied to the above UB. The code assumes `siginfo` is a single `siginfo_t` struct instead of an array, leading to invalid memory access.
Bug Caused by UB: Yes
Confidence (1-10): 9
Fix Suggestion: Replace `siginfo->si_code` with `siginfo[i].si_code` and similarly replace other occurrences where `siginfo` is treated as a single struct instead of iterating over the array properly. Ensure that looping logic properly indexes into the array for all `siginfo` struct fields.
