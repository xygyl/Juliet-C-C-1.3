UB Detected: No

Bug Detected: Yes
Bug Type: Potential Memory Leak
Bug Reason: In the case where the `kzalloc` call fails, the memory allocated to the original `ctx->trees` (pointed to by `p`) is retained and not explicitly freed before returning from the function. This could potentially lead to a memory leak if the allocated memory for `ctx->trees` is not handled later.
Bug Caused by UB: No
Confidence (1-10): 8
Fix Suggestion: Free the memory allocated for `ctx->trees` (pointed by `p`) if `kzalloc` fails and returns NULL. Alternatively, ensure proper cleanup is done by the caller when handling such a case.
